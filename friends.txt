1
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:48,391
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:51,272
You're going out with the guy.

3
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,625
There has to be something
wrong with him.

4
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,453
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

5
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,113
Wait, does he eat chalk?

6
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,168
I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

7
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,517
Okay, everybody relax.

8
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:06,522
This is not even a date.

9
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:09,256
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

10
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:10,874
Sounds like a date to me.

11
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,318
I'm in high school,
in the cafeteria..

12
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,547
and I realize I'm totally naked.

13
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:21,678
I've had that dream.

14
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,275
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

15
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:27,635
there.

16
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,506
- Instead of
- That's right!

17
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:32,363
Never had that one.

18
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,148
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

19
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,307
And it turns out it's my mother.

20
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:43,951
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

21
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,692
He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

22
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,506
You okay?

23
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:58,745
I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth...

24
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:03,300
and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

25
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:07,002
Carol moved her stuff out today.

26
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,646
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

27
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:18,016
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

28
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,550
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

29
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,323
- I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.

30
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:27,510
No, you don't.

31
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:28,580
To hell with her. She left me!

32
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,565
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

33
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:40,719
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

34
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,750
She didn't know.
How should I know?

35
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:49,431
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

36
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:52,886
Did I say that out loud?

37
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:59,027
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

38
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,192
You're angry. You're hurting.

39
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:02,903
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

40
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:05,652
Strip joints!

41
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,091
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

42
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,662
I just want to be married again.

43
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:21,327
And I just want a million dollars!

44
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,782
Rachel?

45
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:28,313
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

46
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:29,746
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

47
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,479
...that you might be here and you are.

48
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,097
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,808
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

50
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:44,089
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe..

51
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,509
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

52
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:47,574
Sure!

53
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,845
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

54
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,575
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

55
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:09,015
I was in this room with
all the presents...

56
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:14,346
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

57
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,572
When all of a sudden I realize...

58
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:17,100
Sweet 'N Low?

59
00:04:17,438 --> 00:04:19,765
I realized...

60
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,424
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

61
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,170
And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

62
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:27,691
How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

63
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,570
I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

64
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:37,748
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

65
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:39,716
. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

66
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:44,735
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

67
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:48,038
. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

68
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,257
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

69
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,598
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

70
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:09,129
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,869
. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

72
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,647
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

73
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:17,786
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:19,431
I just don't love him.

75
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:22,803
Well, it matters to me!

76
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,704
She should not be
wearing those pants.

77
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:31,408
I say push her down the stairs!

78
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:35,596
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

79
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,446
Come on, Daddy, listen!

80
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:44,469
All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

81
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,467
''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

82
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,556
I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

83
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,843
What if I want to be a purse?

84
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,376
Or a hat?''

85
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,407
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

86
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:00,807
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

87
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,627
You can see where he'd have trouble.

88
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,913
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

89
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:13,473
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

90
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,827
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

91
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,598
Well, maybe that's my decision.

92
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,733
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

93
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:27,970
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

94
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,150
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

95
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,591
Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

96
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,988
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

97
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,819
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

98
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:47,942
La la la something
And noodles with string

99
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:53,271
-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

100
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:56,698
I helped.

101
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,198
This is probably for
the best, you know?

102
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,770
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

103
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,152
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

104
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,836
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

105
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,081
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

106
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,180
What? Like there's
a rule or something?

107
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:23,208
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

108
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,817
It's Paul.

109
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,140
Buzz him in.

110
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,879
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

111
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,185
Maybe.

112
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:33,594
Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

113
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:35,014
He finally asked you out?

114
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,241
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

115
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:41,271
Rach, I can cancel.

116
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:42,604
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

117
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,822
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

118
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,723
That'd be good.

119
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:51,868
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

120
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,468
Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

121
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,091
. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

122
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:07,156
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

123
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:09,633
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

124
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,715
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

125
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:21,438
Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

126
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:26,091
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

127
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:27,826
. . .so, nothing.

128
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,279
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

129
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:36,419
Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

130
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:39,410
. . .big lizards.

131
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:45,972
If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

132
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,388
. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

133
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,625
And we're very excited about it.

134
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:56,727
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

135
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,168
-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

136
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,905
Pheebs, wanna help?

137
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:01,954
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

138
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:12,844
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

139
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:16,317
. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

140
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:21,559
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

141
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,702
. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

142
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,904
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

143
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,569
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

144
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,317
This was Carol's favorite beer.

145
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,784
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

146
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:47,922
Let me ask you a question.

147
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:51,593
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

148
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:53,447
What did you get?

149
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:55,306
You guys.

150
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:56,885
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

151
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,465
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

152
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:05,547
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

153
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,936
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

154
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:11,346
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

155
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:12,332
How did you get through it?

156
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,771
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

157
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,129
-Say her--
-Leg?

158
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,622
That's one way of going through it.
Me, I went for the watch.

159
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,872
You actually broke her watch?

160
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:27,408
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

161
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,942
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

162
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:34,659
It's about me.
And I just--

163
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:43,762
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

164
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:50,802
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

165
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:53,492
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

166
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:58,357
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

167
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,723
What are you talking about?
One woman.

168
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:05,743
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

169
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:09,843
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

170
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:14,936
Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

171
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:18,482
You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

172
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:22,056
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

173
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:25,477
You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

174
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,212
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

175
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,918
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

176
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:35,925
Then stay out of my freezer.

177
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,867
Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

178
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:46,054
What? What?

179
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:47,255
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

180
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,202
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

181
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,665
So there's going to be a fifth date?

182
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:56,054
Isn't there?

183
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,774
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

184
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:01,767
What were you going to say?

185
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:08,592
Ever since she left me. . .

186
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:12,485
. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

187
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:14,904
. . .sexually.

188
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,109
Oh, God! Oh, God!

189
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,700
I'm so sorry.

190
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:23,446
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

191
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:27,727
How long?

192
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:29,173
Two years.

193
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:34,227
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

194
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,493
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

195
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:44,659
Yeah, I do.

196
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:57,864
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

197
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,855
''Grab a spoon. ''

198
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:04,237
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

199
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,468
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

200
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:13,438
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

201
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,585
. . .to ask a woman out. . .

202
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:18,383
. . .who am I going to ask?

203
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:40,305
Isn't this amazing?

204
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:43,090
I have never made coffee
before in my life.

205
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:45,861
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

206
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,400
If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

207
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,539
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

208
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,032
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

209
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:03,522
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

210
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,053
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

211
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:12,209
Last night was like. . .

212
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:14,992
-Thank you so much.

213
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:17,248
We'll talk later.

214
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,157
Thank you.

215
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,066
That wasn't a real date.

216
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,751
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

217
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,116
Shut up and put my table back.

218
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,774
I've got to get to work.

219
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,990
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

220
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,308
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

221
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,580
Yeah, we all have jobs.

222
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,140
That's how we buy stuff.

223
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:00,807
Yeah, I'm an actor.

224
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:04,021
Have I seen you in anything?

225
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:06,027
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

226
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:09,539
Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

227
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:12,258
''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

228
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,692
I will not take this abuse.

229
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:18,508
You're right. I'm sorry..

230
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,435
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

231
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,317
How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

232
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:30,705
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

233
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,762
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

234
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,794
I know. He's just so--

235
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:45,839
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

236
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:48,967
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

237
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:52,542
-Are you in trouble!

238
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,930
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

239
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:01,114
Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

240
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,087
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

241
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,264
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

242
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:17,284
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

243
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:19,431
How was Florida?

244
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:20,841
You had sex, didn't you?

245
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,684
How do you do that?

246
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,431
So, who?

247
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:28,212
You know Paul?

248
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,094
Paul, the wine guy?

249
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,040
Yeah, I know Paul.

250
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:36,636
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

251
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:39,091
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

252
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,770
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

253
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:47,790
Of course it was a line.

254
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,494
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

255
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,703
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

256
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:56,383
. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

257
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,497
Is it me?

258
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,408
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

259
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,359
. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

260
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,752
Come here.
Give me your feet.

261
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:16,898
I just thought he was
nice, you know?

262
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:22,085
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

263
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,450
Guess what?

264
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:29,385
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

265
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,110
I'm trained for nothing.

266
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,473
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

267
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:36,760
You're surprisingly upbeat.

268
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:39,875
You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

269
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:41,518
. . .50% percent off.

270
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,471
How well you know me.

271
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,994
They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

272
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:49,633
I've got great boots,'' boots.

273
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,505
-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

274
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:55,522
And who pays for that?

275
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,191
My father.

276
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,630
You can't live off your parents.

277
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:05,867
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

278
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,473
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

279
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:11,540
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

280
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:14,122
When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

281
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,613
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

282
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,232
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

283
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:23,963
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

284
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:27,629
And then he killed himself.

285
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,491
Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

286
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:36,381
The word you're looking for is:

287
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,635
''Anyway. . . . ''

288
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,733
You ready?

289
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,059
-I don't think so.

290
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:51,391
Cut, cut, cut.

291
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:57,025
Welcome to the real world!

292
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,119
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

293
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,509
That's it.

294
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,130
You gonna crash on the couch?

295
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,012
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

296
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,618
Look what I just
found on the floor.

297
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:20,756
What?

298
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,879
That's Paul's watch.

299
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,165
You can just put it back
where you found it.

300
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,302
Oh, boy! All right.

301
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,516
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

302
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:43,155
-I'm sorry.
-No!

303
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:45,525
-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

304
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,718
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

305
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:55,703
. . .a major crush on you.

306
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:58,664
I knew.

307
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,143
You did?

308
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:04,695
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

309
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,399
I did.

310
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:12,979
Listen, do you think--

311
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:17,149
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

312
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,487
Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

313
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:26,976
Maybe.

314
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:36,169
Okay, maybe I will.

315
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,963
-Good night.
-Good night.

316
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,252
See you.

317
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:00,171
Wait, wait.

318
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:01,935
What's with you?

319
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:05,509
I just grabbed a spoon.

320
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:15,923
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

321
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:17,558
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

322
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,697
-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

323
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:21,885
Would you stop?

324
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,633
Was I doing it again?

325
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:27,479
Would anybody like more coffee?

326
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:31,847
Did you make it?

327
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,910
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

328
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:37,611
Kids, new dream.

329
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:39,132
I'm in Las Vegas.

330
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:40,458
I'm Liza Minnelli.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,040
What you guys don't understand is, for us,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,680
kissing is as important as any part of it.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,200
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,280
You serious?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,800
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,280
Absolutely.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,880
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,480
like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's
like the stand-up comedian you have to sit

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,880
through before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,080
Yeah, and-and it's not that 
we don't like the comedian,

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,000
it's that-that... that's not

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
why we bought the ticket.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,480
The problem is, though, after the concert's
over, no matter how great the show was,

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,000
you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,880
I mean, we're in the car,
we're fighting traffic... basically

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,600
just trying to stay awake.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,800
Yeah, well, word of advice: 
Bring back the comedian.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,638
Otherwise next time you're
gonna find yourself

20
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,800
sitting at home, listening
to that album alone.

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,200
Are we still talking about sex?

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,600
FRIENDS

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,200
102 The one whith
the sonogram at the end

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,240
No, it's good, it is good, 
it's just that... mm...

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Doesn't she seem a little angry?

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,840
Well, she has issues.

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360
Does she.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,160
He's out banging other women over the
head with a club, while she sits at home

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,760
trying to get the mastodon 
smell out of the carpet!

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,320
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay?

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,240
They have issues like...

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,640
'Gee, that glacier's
getting kinda close.' See?

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,760
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
No. No.

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,440
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,160
Okay, okay, yes, it is.

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,840
How about I'll, uh, catch up 
with you in the Ice Age.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
Hi.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,800
So.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
You look great. I, uh...

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,600
I hate that.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,120
Sorry. Thanks.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,200
You look good too.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,200
Ah, well, in here, 
anyone who...

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
stands erect...

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,800
So what's new? Still, uh...

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,200
A lesbian?

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,320
Well... you never know.

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,320
How's, um... how's the family?

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh...

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why... why are you here, Carol?

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm pregnant.

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,600
Pregnant?!

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company
where there's some kind of misunderstanding.

54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,360
Then I've already seen this one!

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,680
Are you through with that?

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,480
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing 
slowed me down.

57
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,280
Whose little ball of paper is this?!

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,360
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a
note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it,

59
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,360
so I balled it up and... 
...now I wish I was dead.

60
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,697
She's already fluffed that pillow...

61
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:16,460
Monica, you know, you've 
already fluffed that...
...but, it's fine!

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,360
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give
them any more ammunition than they already have.

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,280
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,360
can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,280
Monica... Hi! 
Um, Monica, you're scaring me.

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I mean, you're like, you're like all
chaotic and twirly.

67
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,280
And not-not in a good way.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
Yeah, calm down.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,480
You don't see Ross getting all
chaotic and twirly every time they come.

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,680
That's because as far as my parents are
concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

71
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,560
Y'see, he's the Prince.

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,960
Apparently they had some
big ceremony before I was born.

73
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,680
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?

74
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,694
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!

75
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:04,234
Eeaagh!

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yeah, it's beautiful.

77
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,320
No, look, don't touch that!

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,920
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back to him...

80
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,720
'Hi Barry! Remember me? 
I'm the girl in the veil

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,720
who stomped on your heart 
in front of your entire family!'

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
Oh God and now I'm gonna have to 
return the ring, without the ring,

83
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,720
which makes it so much harder...

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,240
Easy Rach, we'll find it. 
Won't we!

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,320
Oh! Yeah!

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,320
Doy! 
Probably right before she lost it!

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,520
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,920
I know I had it this morning,

90
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,240
and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...

91
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
...Dinah?

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,120
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,440
You didn't.
Oh, I am sorry...

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,440
I gave you one job!

95
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

96
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you
look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...

97
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,240
I just... can't do it.

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Boys?

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,880
We're going in.

100
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
Hi.

101
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,080
Wow. That is not a happy hi.

102
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,800
Carol's pregnant.

103
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,400
Ooh! I found it!

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,400
W... w... wh... 
wha... w... w... w...

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
Yeah. Do that for another two hours,

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,180
you might be where I am right about now.

107
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in
perspective, huh, Mon?

108
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,400
Well now, how...
how do you fit into this whole thing?

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,200
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me
to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable

110
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,880
with it, I don't have to be involved..

111
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,680
basically it's entirely up to me.

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,880
She is so great! I miss her.

113
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,680
What does she mean by 'involved'?

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I mean presumably, the biggest part of
your job is done.

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Anyway, they want me to go down to this...

116
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,280
sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

117
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,480
So what are you gonna do?

118
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,080
I have no idea.

119
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,280
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,240
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?

121
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
Oh, Martha Ludwin's
daughter is gonna call you.

122
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,560
Mmm! What's that curry taste?

123
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,440
Curry.
Mmmm!

124
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,560
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.

125
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Do you remember the Ludwins?
The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

126
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,840
They all had a thing for him.

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
Aw, Mom...

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm sorry, why is this 
girl going to call me?

129
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,760
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
 to be something in cooking, or food, or...

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
I don't know.

131
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,360
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant...

132
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,360
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant,
I work in a restaurant.

133
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,840
Well, they don't have to know that...

134
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,160
Ross, could you come and help me
with the spaghetti, please?

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,840
Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti!

136
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
That's.... easy.

137
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,360
I know this is going to sound 
unbelievably selfish,

138
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,440
but, were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

139
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,640
Because I think it might take 
some of the heat off me.

140
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,120
What that Rachel did to her life...
We ran into her parents at the club,

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,400
they were not playing very well.

142
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm not gonna tell you what
they spent on that wedding...

143
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,320
but forty thousand dollars
 is a lot of money!

144
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, at least she had the
chance to leave a man at the altar...

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
What's that supposed to mean?

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Nothing!

147
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,400
It's an expression.
No it's not.

148
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you always have been!

149
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,920
Even when you were a kid...

150
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
and you were chubby, and you had 
no friends, you were just fine!

151
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,320
And you would read alone in your room,
and your puzzles...

152
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,200
Look, there are people like Ross
who need to shoot for the stars,

153
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
with his museum,
and his papers getting published.

154
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Other people are satisfied with
staying where they are...

155
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm telling you,
these are the people who never get cancer.

156
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,720
And I read about these women 
trying to have it all,

157
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,600
and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica'
doesn't seem to have that problem.

158
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,960
No news, no little anecdotes 
to share with the folks?

160
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,280
Okay! Okay.
Look, I, uh... I realise you guys

161
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,280
have been wondering what exactly

162
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,560
happened between Carol and me, and,
so, well, here's the deal.

163
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,280
Carol's a lesbian.

164
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,880
She's living with a woman named Susan.

165
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,560
She's pregnant with my child, and she and

166
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,280
Susan are going to raise the baby.

167
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
And you knew about this?!

168
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,480
Your folks are really that bad, huh?

169
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,880
Well, y'know, these people are pros.

170
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,480
They know what they're doing,
they take their time,

171
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,160
they get the job done.

172
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,880
Boy, I know they say
you can't change your parents...

173
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,680
boy, if you could...
I'd want yours.

174
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,440
Must pee.

175
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,120
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.

176
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
You're twins?
Yeah. We don't speak.

177
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,640
She's like this high-powered, 
driven career type.

178
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,240
What does she do?
She's a waitress.

179
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
All right, you guys, 
I kinda gotta clean up now.

180
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Chandler, you're an only child, right?
You don't have any of this.

181
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,520
Well, no, although I did have an 
imaginary friend, who...

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,720
my parents actually preferred.

183
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
The lights, please...

184
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
How long was I in there?

185
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
I'm just cleaning up.

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,520
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?

187
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
Uh.. okay, sure!
Thanks!

188
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,120
Anyway.. um..

189
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,720
So, you... uh... 
you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

190
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,240
Oh.. a little.. 
Mm-hmm.. A lot.

191
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,840
Mm.
So, got any advice?

192
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,840
Y'know, as someone who's 
recently been... dumped?

193
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,920
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'.

194
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,920
Chances are he's gonna be this,
this broken shell of a man, y'know,

195
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,280
so you should try not to look too terrific,
I know it'll be hard.

196
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,400
Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll 
give Barry back his ring,

197
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,000
and you can go with 
Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...

198
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,680
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow...

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,880
When did it get so complicated?

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,280
Got me.

201
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,200
Remember when we were
in high school together?
Yeah.

202
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,680
I mean, didn't you think you were just
gonna meet somone, fall in love...

203
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
and that'd be it?

204
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:28,974
...Ross?
Yes, yes!

205
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..

206
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,280
Me neither...

207
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,080
Hi. Sorry I'm late,
I was stuck at work.

208
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
There was this big dinosaur... thing...
anyway.

209
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,560
Hi.

210
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,440
Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?

211
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Ross.
Hello, Susan.
 Good shake. Good shake.

212
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,160
So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

213
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,360
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he...

214
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,640
She.
...she, of course

215
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,960
She... uh... familiar with our...
special situation?

216
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,160
Yes, and she's very supportive.

217
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,160
Okay, that's great.

218
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
No, I'm... Oh.

219
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,240
Thanks.

220
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
Ross? That opens my cervix.

221
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,440
Barry?

222
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,960
C'mon in.

223
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,040
Are you sure?

224
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,360
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

225
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
So, how ya doin?

226
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,600
I'm... uh...

227
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,920
I'm okay...

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
You look great!

229
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,120
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.

230
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,920
Be right there.
Be back in a sec.

231
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,320
I dumped him.
Okay.

232
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,120
So, um... so how's this, uh,
how's this gonna work?

233
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Y'know, with us?

234
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Y'know, when, like, important 
decisions have to be made?

235
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,400
Give me a 'for instance'.

236
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,200
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, 
okay, okay,

237
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,120
How about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
-Marlon!
-Marlen?

238
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,720
...if it's a boy, 
Minnie if it's a girl.

239
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,520
...As in Mouse?

240
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
As in my grandmother.

241
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,520
Still, you... you say Minnie, 
you hear Mouse.

242
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,600
Um, how about, um...

243
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,600
how about Julia?

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Julia.

245
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,400
We agreed on Minnie.

246
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,200
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend
the rest of our lives together.

247
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,080
Things change, 
roll with the punches.

248
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,760
I believe Julia's on the table...?

249
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,880
Sorry about that.

250
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,280
So. What have you been up to?

251
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,080
Oh, not much.

252
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,680
I... I got a job.

253
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,160
Oh, that's great.

254
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Why are... why are you so tanned?

255
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Oh, I, uh... I went to Aruba.

256
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,560
Oh no.
You went on our honeymoon alone?

257
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,280
No.

258
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,560
I went with, uh..
Now, this may hurt.

259
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,880
Me?!

260
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,080
No!
I went with Mindy.

261
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,560
Mindy?

262
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,280
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!

263
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,680
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.

264
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,560
Oh! Well, um..
You've got plugs!

265
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.

266
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,280
And you've got lenses!

267
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
But you hate sticking 
your finger in your eye!

268
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,360
Not for her.

269
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,860
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay...

270
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,320
See, about a month ago,
I wanted to hurt you.

271
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
More than I've ever wanted to 
hurt anyone in my life.

272
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
And I'm an orthodontist.

273
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,040
You know, you were right?

274
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I mean, I thought we were happy.

275
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,840
We weren't happy.

276
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,520
But with Mindy, now I'm happy.

277
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,120
Spit.

278
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
What?

279
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,520
Me.

280
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,520
Anyway, um,

281
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,240
I guess this belongs to you.

282
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,240
And thank you for giving it to me.

283
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,120
Well, thank you for giving it back.

284
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,520
Hello?!

285
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,320
Oh, please! 
What's wrong with Helen?

286
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,920
Helen Geller?

287
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,040
I don't think so.

288
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,320
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

289
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,720
Thank you!

290
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,840
No, I mean it's not Geller.

291
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

292
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,240
No, actually, um,
we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

293
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,840
Well, wait a minute, wha...
why is she in the title?

294
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,640
It's my baby too.

295
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,120
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember
you making any sperm.

296
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah, and we all know 
what a challenge that is!

297
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,200
All right, you two, stop it!

298
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,280
No no no, she gets a credit, hey,
I'm in there too.

299
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Ross. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller?

300
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,800
'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

301
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Of course not, I'm... 
suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

302
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? 
He knows no-one's gonna say all
those names, so they'll wind up calling her
Geller, then he gets his way!

303
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
My way?! 
You... you think this is my way?

304
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being, this is not my way...

305
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,680
y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard.
I'm not, I can't do...

306
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
How are we today?
Any nausea?

307
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
A little.

308
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,080
Well, I was just wondering about the 
mother-to-be, but... thanks for sharing.

309
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
Uh, lie back..

310
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
You... uh... y'know what, 
I'm gonna go.

311
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,200
I don't... I don't think I can be involved in this
particular thing right now.

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,200
Oh my God.

313
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Look at that.

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
I know.

315
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Well? Isn't that amazing?

316
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,960
What are we supposed to be seeing here?

317
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,960
I dunno, but... I think it's 
about to attack the Enterprise.

318
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,160
You know, if you tilt your head to the left,

319
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,840
and relax your eyes,
it kinda looks like an old potato.

320
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,240
Then don't do that, alright?
Okay!

321
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,460
Monica. Whaddya think?
Mm-hmm.

322
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,160
Wh... are you welling up?

323
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,360
No.

324
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,640
You are, you're welling up.
Am not!

325
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,440
You're gonna be an aunt.
Oh shut up!

326
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,840
Hi, Mindy.

327
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,960
Hi, it... it's Rachel.

328
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,240
Yeah, I'm fine. I... 
I saw Barry today.

329
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,360
Oh, yeah, yeah he... he told me.
No, no, it's okay.

330
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,760
I hope you two are very happy,
I really do.

331
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if...if

332
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,760
everything works out, and you guys end
up getting married and having kids...

333
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,840
and everything... 
I just hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose.

334
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,960
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,320
Hi guys!
Hey, Pheebs!

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,760
Oh, oh, how'd it go?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Um, not so good.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,920
He walked me to the subway and said
'We should do this again!'
Ohh. Ouch.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,800
What?
He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,880
Uh, no. Loosely translated
'We should do this again' means

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,000
'You will never see me naked'.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,480
Since when?

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,840
Since always.
It's like dating language.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,240
Y'know, like
'It's not you' means 'It is you'.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,120
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means
'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,920
and complaining about them to you'.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,680
Or, or, y'know, um,
'I think we should see other people'

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,480
'Ha, ha, I already am'.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,840
And everybody knows this?

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,160
Yeah. Cushions the blow.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,640
Yeah, it's like when you're a kid,
and your parents put your dog to sleep,

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,080
and they tell you it
went off to live on some farm.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,480
That's funny, that, no, because,
uh, our parents actually did,

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,160
uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,320
Uh, Ross.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,880
What? Wh- hello?
The Millners' farm in Connecticut?

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,360
The Millners, they had
this unbelievable farm,

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,000
they had horses, and,
and rabbits that he could

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,080
chase and it was- it w- .....

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,280
Oh my God, Chi Chi!

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,800
FRIENDS

28
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:10,401
"So how does it feel knowing
you're about to die?"

29
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,895
"Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

30
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:19,650
But you'll have to live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die."

31
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,808
Hey, that was really good!

32
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:23,846
Thanks! Let's keep going.

33
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:29,322
Okay.
"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"

34
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:34,038
"I just wanna go back to my cell.
'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."

35
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,635
"Smoke away."

36
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,822
I think this is probably why
 Damone smokes in his cell alone.

37
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:54,900
What?
Relax your hand!

38
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:59,416
Not so much!

39
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:02,413
Alright, now try taking a puff.

40
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:05,651
Alright..

41
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,690
Okay.
No. Give it to me.

42
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,128
No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.

43
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:13,044
It's fine, it's fine. Look,
do you wanna get this part, or not?

44
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:16,162
Here.
Don't think of it as a cigarette..

45
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:20,718
Think of it as the thing that's
been missing from your hand.

46
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,156
When you're holding it, you feel right.

47
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:24,554
You feel complete.

48
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:25,674
Y'miss it?

49
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,831
Nah, not so much.

50
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:32,628
Alright, now we smoke.

51
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:37,583
Oh.. my.. God.

52
00:03:44,977 --> 00:03:48,254
They say it's the same as the distance from

53
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:52,171
the tip of a guy's thumb
to the tip of his index finger.

54
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,085
That's ridiculous!

55
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:02,282
Can I use.. either thumb?

56
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:05,480
Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!

57
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,196
Decaf cappucino for Joey..

58
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,873
Coffee black..

59
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:15,711
Late...

60
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,469
And an iced tea.

61
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,028
I'm getting pretty good at this!

62
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:20,986
Yeah. Yeah, excellent.

63
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:23,904
Good for me!

64
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:36,573
Y'okay, Phoebe?

65
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:38,292
Yeah... no... I'm just... it's, I haven't worked...

66
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,890
It's my bank.

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,128
What did they do to you?

68
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:46,125
It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
I'm going through my mail,

69
00:04:46,365 --> 00:04:48,963
and I open up their monthly, you know,
STATEMENT... Easy.

70
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,440
...and there's five hundred
extra dollars in my account.

71
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,757
Oh, Satan's minions at work again...

72
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:58,395
Yes, 'cause now I have to go
down there, and deal with them.

73
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,353
What are you talking about?
Keep it!

74
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:01,632
It's not mine, I didn't earn it,

75
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:04,389
if I kept it, it would be like stealing.

76
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:09,465
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping!

77
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:12,423
Okay. Okay, let's say I bought
a really great pair of shoes.

78
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:14,781
Do you know what I'd hear,
with every step I took?

79
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,498
'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.'

80
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:20,296
And even if I was happy,
okay, and, and skipping...

81
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:23,533
'Not... not... mine, not... not... mine,
not... not... mine, not... not... mine'...

82
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,251
We're with you. We got it.

83
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:30,367
Okay. I'd... just... I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It would be like this giant karmic debt.

84
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,805
Chandler, what are you doing?

85
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:36,122
Hey. Whaddya doing?

86
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,039
Oh! Oh, God!

87
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,198
What is this?!

88
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:42,637
I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.

89
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:45,235
Oh, I can't believe you!
You've been so good, for three years!

90
00:05:45,474 --> 00:05:48,991
And this... is my reward!

91
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:52,428
Hold on a second, alright?
Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.

92
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:55,026
Okay, so this time I won't quit!

93
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,944
Ohhh! Put it out!

94
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,622
All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.

95
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:03,299
Oh, no! I... I can't drink this now!

96
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,735
Alright. I'm gonna go change,
I've got a date.

97
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,293
This Alan again? How's it goin'?

98
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:14,450
'S'going pretty good, y'know?
It's nice, and, we're having fun.

99
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:16,408
So when do we get to meet the guy?

100
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:18,406
Let's see, today's Monday...

101
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:20,245
Never.

102
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,963
Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.

103
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:23,562
What are you talking about?

104
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:28,398
We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!..

105
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:30,716
Sorry.

106
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:33,913
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet.
Just give me a chance to figure that out.

107
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:36,671
Well, then can we meet him?

108
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,268
Nope. Schhorry.

109
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,705
I mean, why should I let them meet him?

110
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,142
and within five minutes they're all over him.

111
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:50,939
I mean, they're like... coyotes,
picking off the weak members of the herd.

112
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:55,415
Listen. As someone who's seen
more than her fair share of bad beef,

113
00:06:55,655 --> 00:06:59,212
I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.

114
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,809
I mean, they're your friends,
they're just looking out after you.

115
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:05,206
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring
a guy home that they actually liked.

116
00:07:05,446 --> 00:07:08,883
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening
are a little slimmer

117
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,520
if they never get to meet the guy...

118
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,199
Let it go, Ross.

119
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,636
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.

120
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:21,193
Do you all promise?

121
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,950
Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!

122
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,427
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?

123
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:39,857
You can come in,
but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!

124
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,404
Hey, Pheebs.

125
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,889
'Dear Ms. Buffay.

126
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:50,648
Thank you for calling attention to our error.

127
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,884
We have credited your account
with five hundred dollars.

128
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:59,400
We're sorry for the inconvenence,
and hope you'll accept this football phone

129
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,917
as our free gift.'
Do you believe this?!

130
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:07,713
Now I have a thousand dollars,
and a football phone!

131
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,751
What bank is this?

132
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,387
Hey. It's him.

133
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:15,626
 Who is it?
It's Alan.

134
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:18,944
Chandler! He's here!

135
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:22,740
Okay, please be good, please.

136
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,977
Just remember how much you all like me.

137
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,813
Hi.
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

138
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,366
I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!

139
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:47,959
Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.

140
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:54,114
Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

141
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:57,591
Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?

142
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,709
C'mon!

143
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:02,746
...I'll go.

144
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:06,303
Let's start with the way
he kept picking at...

145
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:07,862
no, I'm sorry,

146
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:09,461
I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.

147
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,899
Loved him! Yeah! He's great!

148
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:12,178
Wait a minute!

149
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,416
We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
Yeah!

150
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,913
And did you notice...?
Yeah.

151
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,967
Know what was great?
The way his smile was kinda crooked.

152
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,605
Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!

153
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:30,043
...What shoe?

154
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,562
From the nursery rhyme.

155
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,880
'There was a crooked man,
Who had a crooked smile,

156
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:38,156
Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'

157
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,833
...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against

158
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:45,989
which all future boyfriends will be measured.

159
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:47,348
What future boyfriends?

160
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,625
Nono, I th... I think this could be, y'know, it.
Really!

161
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:54,662
Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhof impression alone.

162
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:58,659
You know I'm gonna be
doing that at parties, right?

163
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:03,934
You know what I like most about him, though?
What?

164
00:10:04,174 --> 00:10:08,890
The way he makes me feel about myself.
Yeah...

165
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,431
Hi... how was the game?

166
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,110
Well...

167
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,187
WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!

168
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:39,024
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?

169
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,382
Alan.
He was unbelievable.

170
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:45,019
e was like that...that... that Bugs Bunny
cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions,

171
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:50,015
right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan,
second base-Alan, third base-...

172
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:55,410
I mean, it...it was like,
it was like he made us into a team.

173
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:01,445
Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball..

174
00:11:01,445 --> 00:11:03,004
Can I ask you guys a question?

175
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,602
D'you ever think that Alan is maybe... sometimes...

176
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:06,761
What?

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,478
...I dunno, a little too Alan?

178
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:13,035
Well, no. That's impossible.
You can never be too Alan.

179
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:17,791
Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness
that... that... that we adore.

180
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,628
I personally could have a gallon of Alan.

181
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:26,903
Hey, Lizzie.

182
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:28,422
Hey, Weird Girl.

183
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,499
I brought you alphabet soup.
Did you pick out the vowels?

184
00:11:31,739 --> 00:11:35,576
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y".

185
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:36,895
Uh, I also have something else for you.

186
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:38,094
Saltines?

187
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,851
No, but would you like a
thousand dollars and a football phone?

188
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,249
What?

189
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:45,008
Oh my God,

190
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:47,885
there's really money in here.
I know.

191
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,644
Weird Girl, what are you doing?

192
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:52,721
No, I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

193
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:54,720
No, no, I ha...
I have to give you something.

194
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,478
Oh, that's fine, no.

195
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,556
Would you like my tin-foil hat?

196
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:01,474
No. 'Cause you need that.
No, it's okay, thanks.

197
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,072
Please, let me do something.

198
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:09,707
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda,
and then we're even. Okay?
Okay.

199
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:11,814
Okay.
Keep the change.

200
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:12,893
Thanks, Lizzie.

201
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:14,292
Sure you don't wanna pretzel?

202
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:18,928
No, I'm fine.
See ya.

203
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:27,501
Huh!
A thumb?!

204
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,398
I know! I know,
I opened it up and there it was,

205
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:35,234
just floating in there,
like this tiny little hitch-hiker!

206
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:39,630
Well, maybe it's a contest,
y'know? Like, collect all five?

207
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:41,788
Does, um, anyone wanna see?

208
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,786
Nooo!

209
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:46,664
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!

210
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:49,742
It's worse than the thumb!

211
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:51,740
Hey, this is so unfair!

212
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,299
Oh, why is it unfair?

213
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:56,136
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

214
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:58,894
Like Joey's constant
knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?

215
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:01,172
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing
every single word?

216
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:03,610
And Monica, with that snort
when she laughs?

217
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,447
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

218
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:12,242
I accept all those flaws,
why can't you accept me for this?

219
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:22,274
Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?

220
00:14:24,552 --> 00:14:27,709
Well, I... I could live without it.

221
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:34,863
Well, is it, like, a little annoying,
or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

222
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:39,219
Oh, now, don't listen to him,
Pheebs, I think it's endearing.

223
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,056
Oh, "you do, do you"?

224
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,530
You know, there's nothing
wrong with speaking correctly.

225
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,846
"Indeed there isn't"...

226
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,124
I should really get back to work.

227
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:02,040
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone
might get what they actually ordered.

228
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,196
The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.

229
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,101
Did you ever go out with a
guy your friends all really like?

230
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,579
No.

231
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:31,895
Okay... Well, I'm going out with a guy
my friends all really like.

232
00:15:32,134 --> 00:15:34,532
Wait... wait... we talking
about the coyotes here?

233
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:38,729
All right, a cow got through!

234
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:40,287
Can you believe it?

235
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,046
...Y'know what?

236
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:44,923
I just don't feel the thing.

237
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:47,641
I mean, they feel the thing,

238
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:50,159
I don't feel the thing.

239
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,916
Honey... you should always feel the thing.

240
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:57,952
Listen, if that's how you feel
about the guy, Monica, dump him!

241
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,751
I know... it's gonna be really hard.

242
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,749
Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.

243
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:06,825
No, he'll be fine.
It's the other five I'm worried about.

244
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,663
Do you have any respect for your body?

245
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,901
Don't you realise what
you're-you're doing to yourself?

246
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:13,059
Hey, y'know, I have had it with
you guys and your cancer

247
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,058
and your emphysema and your heart disease.

248
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:20,133
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

249
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,330
Chandler? It's Alan,
he wants to speak to you.

250
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,767
Really? He does?

251
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:31,164
Hey, buddy, what's up!

252
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:34,201
Oh, she told you about that, huh.

253
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:38,917
Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.

254
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:42,155
Well, it's not that big...

255
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,111
well, that's true...

256
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:50,907
Gee, y'know, no-one...
no-one's ever put it like that before.

257
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:54,504
Well, okay, thanks!

258
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,455
God, he's good.

259
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:08,572
If only he were a woman.
Yeah.

260
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,486
Ooh, Lambchop.

261
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:18,883
How old is that sock?

262
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:24,279
If I had a sock on my hand for
thirty years it'd be talking too.

263
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:30,314
Okay. I think it's time to
change somebody's nicotine patch.

264
00:17:32,632 --> 00:17:33,431
Hey. Where's Joey?

265
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:38,027
Joey ate my last stick of gum,
so I killed him.

266
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:41,504
Do you think that was wrong?

267
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:44,382
I think he's across the hall.

268
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:46,660
Thanks.
There y'go.

269
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,857
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

270
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:54,493
Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?...
Pheebs?

271
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:58,689
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

272
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,047
Hey, I might!

273
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:03,046
Sorry...

274
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:08,121
Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me
seven thousand dollars for the thumb.

275
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:08,718
You're kidding.
Oh my God.

276
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:12,597
And on my way over here,
I stepped in gum.

277
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:14,716
...What is up with the universe?!

278
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:15,875
What's going on?

279
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:18,632
Nothing.
I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

280
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:23,468
Even nicer when everyone
gets to wear their underwear...

281
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:34,019
Uh, Joey... Oh, God! Okay...
Oh! That was Lambchop!

282
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:35,058
Please, guys, we have to talk.

283
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,977
Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...

284
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,814
No, I'm not.

285
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:42,052
Alright, we have to talk.

286
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,650
There it is!

287
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:48,727
Okay. It's-it's about Alan.

288
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:52,404
There's something that you should know.

289
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:57,040
I mean, there's really
no easy way to say this...

290
00:18:57,239 --> 00:19:01,076
uh... I've decided to break up with Alan.

291
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:07,231
Is there somebody else?

292
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,109
No, nononono... it's just... things change.

293
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:13,186
People change.

294
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:17,023
We didn't change..

295
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:21,099
So that's it? It's over?

296
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,377
Just like that?

297
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:29,772
You know.. you let your guard down,
you start to really care about someone,
and I just... I...

298
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:35,527
Look, I... I could go on pretending...
Okay!

299
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:38,684
...but that wouldn't be fair to me,
it wouldn't be fair to Alan...
It wouldn't be fair to you!

300
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,882
Who... who wants fair?

301
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:46,198
Y'know, I just want things back.
Y'know, the way they were.

302
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:47,397
I'm sorry...

303
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:51,993
Oh, she's sorry!
I feel better!

304
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,552
I just can't believe this!

305
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:59,227
I mean, with the holidays coming up...
I wanted him to meet my family...

306
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,304
I'll meet somone else.
There'll be other Alans.

307
00:20:02,544 --> 00:20:05,062
Oh, yeah! Right!

308
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,858
Are you guys gonna be okay?

309
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:11,656
Hey hey, we'll be fine.

310
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:14,933
We're just gonna need a little time.

311
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,370
I understand.

312
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:24,205
Wow.
I'm, I'm really sorry.

313
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:27,443
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

314
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:29,681
But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.

315
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:30,880
Relieved?

316
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,636
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you...

317
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:38,713
I just can't stand your friends.

318
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:48,704
Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?

319
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:52,142
That was fun.

320
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:56,138
Yeah.
He could row like a viking.

321
00:20:57,872 --> 00:21:00,194
Hi.
Mmm.

322
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,050
So how'd it go?

323
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,249
Oh, y'know..

324
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:10,126
Did he mention us?

325
00:21:13,843 --> 00:21:17,920
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.

326
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:23,875
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.

327
00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:32,747
...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
No no no!

328
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:33,866
I don't care, I don't care! Game's over!

329
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:37,023
I'm weak! I've gotta smoke!
I've gotta have the smoke!

330
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,660
If you never smoke again
I'll give you seven thousand dollars!

331
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,897
Yeah, alright.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,720
Oh, look! There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,200
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,240
You can spot someone who's
never seen his plays.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,840
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,200
The exclamation point scares me.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,720
It's not just Freud, it's Freud!

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,440
Magic is about to happen!

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,640
Well, Eva...

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,840
...we've done
some excellent work here.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,000
And I would have to say...

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,320
...your problem is quite clear.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,800
<i>All you want is a dinkle</i>

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,760
<i>What you envy's a schwang</i>

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,160
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,920
<i>To play with or simply let hang</i>

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
FRIENDS

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
I feel violated.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,720
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off...

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
...to have something else to do?

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
Ross, 10:00.

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,440
Is it? It feels like 2.

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,880
-No, 1 0:00!
-What?

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,480
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 1 0:00!

24
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
Hello!

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,240
She's amazing!

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,000
She makes the women l
dream about look like fat, bald men.

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,840
Go over.
She's not with anyone.

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
And what would my opening line be?

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,880
Excuse me...

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,080
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

31
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,160
Could she be more out of my league?
Back me up.

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,680
He couldn't get a woman
like that in a million years.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,840
You always see these beautiful
women with "nothing" guys.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,720
You could be one of those guys.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,720
-You could do that.
-You think?

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,760
Absolutely!

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
I can't believe
I'm considering this.

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,240
-l' m very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,120
Here goes.

40
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,080
-Yes?
-Hi. Okay, next word would be...

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,200
... Chandler.

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,280
Chandler is my name and....

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,800
Hi!

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,840
Yes, you said that.

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,880
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say....

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,080
What I wanted to say was...

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,800
...would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,680
Chandler?

49
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,760
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,040
What'd you think?

51
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,240
-I didn't know you could dance!
-You were in a play!

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,000
It wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,200
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,520
-You're right.
-We saw your head.

55
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,400
She said yes!
She said yes!

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,680
Awful play, man!

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,320
Her name's Aurora. She's ltalian
and she pronounces my name " Chandler. "

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,800
I like that better.
The usher gave me this.

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,960
-What is it?
-The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,880
An agency left its card.
They wanna sign me!

61
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,720
Based on this play?

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,160
Based on this play!

63
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,440
Hey kids!

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040


65
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,600
It's been seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

66
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,320
How was your date, Chandler?

67
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,720
It was unbelievable!

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,520
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had an amazing life!

69
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,040
<i>She was in the Israeli army.</i>

70
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
None of the bullets hit the engine,

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,920
so we made it to the border.

72
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,800
But just barely, and l....

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,760
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
What about you? Tell me a story.

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
All right, once...

76
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,840
... I got on the subway.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,640
And it was at night...

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,040
...and I rode it all the way
to Brooklyn.

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,560
Just for the hell of it.

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,240
We talked until 2:00. It was perfect.

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
More or less.

82
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,000
Suddenly, we realized we were
in Yemen.

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,360
I' m sorry, so "we" is...?

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,800
"We" is me and Rick.

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
Who's Rick?

86
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,360
Who's Rick?

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,000
My husband.

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,840
-Oh, so you' re divorced?
-No.

89
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,160
I' m sorry. So you' re widowed?
Hopefully?

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,240
No, l' m still married.

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,840
So, how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me...

92
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,120
...sliding your foot so far up my leg

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,280
you can count the change in my pocket?

94
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,600
Don't worry.

95
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,200
He'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

96
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,440
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

97
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,840
Ethan is my...

98
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,960
...boyfriend.

99
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,720
What?

100
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
What kind of relationship
do you imagine us having...

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
...if you have a husband
and a boyfriend?

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,480
I suppose, mainly sexual.

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Sorry it didn't work out.

104
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,520
What, not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,680
Didn't you listen to the story?

106
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,160
Didn't YOU listen? It's twisted!

107
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,000
How could you get involved
with her?

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,480
I had trouble with it at first.
But I get the good stuff.

109
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,960
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex...

110
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,280
...and none of the responsibility.

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,040
This is every guy's fantasy!

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,720
-That's not true!
-Ross, is this your fantasy?

113
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,080
No, of course not.

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

115
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,040
You'd go out with someone
going out with someone else?

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,040
I couldn't.

117
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,320
Good for you.

118
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,600
When l' m with a woman,
I need to know...

119
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,040
... I' m going out
with more people than her.

120
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,080
You know...

121
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,160
monogamy can be
a tricky concept.

122
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,280
I mean, anthropologically speaking

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,400
Fine. Now you'll never know.

124
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,120
We're kidding. Tell us.

125
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,840
-We wanna know.
-Come on!

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,240
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey

127
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,960
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like it.

128
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,640
Look! I cleaned!

129
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,000
I did the windows.
I did the floors.

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,400
I used all the vacuum attachments
but the round one.

131
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,000
What's it for?

132
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Nobody knows. 
And we're not supposed to ask.

133
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,640
What do you think?

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,960
-It's very clean.
-Really, it looks great!

135
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,760
I see you moved the green ottoman.

136
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,640
How did that happen?

137
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,240
I don't know. It looked better there.

138
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,000
And it's an extra seat
around the table.

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,560
Yeah, it's interesting.

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,840
But you know what? Just for fun...

141
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,840
...Iet's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

142
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,760
Just to compare.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,400
Let's see.

144
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,720
Well, it looks good there too.

145
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,640
Let's leave it there for a while.

146
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,440
I can't believe you moved
the green ottoman.

147
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,760
Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,800
She'll scratch your eyes out.

149
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,760
You guys, I am not that bad!

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
Yeah, you are.

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,000
Remember, I lived with you?

152
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,480
You were a little....

153
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,040
That is so unfair!

154
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,440
When we were kids, yours was the only
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

155
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,160
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

156
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,640
But hey, I can be a kook!

157
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,920
All right, you madcap gal!

158
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
Imagine this.

159
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,000
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,000
Why not?

161
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,200
Because you're a kook!

162
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,040
You wait until they send a notice.

163
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,400
I could do that.

164
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,400
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping

165
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,440
And I buy detergent,

166
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,840
but it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

167
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Why would someone do that?

168
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
One might wonder.

169
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
A glass is on the table with no coaster.

170
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,040
 A cold drink. A hot day.

171
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,400
Beads of condensation are inching
closer to the wood...

172
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,120
Stop it!

173
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,640
Oh, my God!

174
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,960
It's true. Who am l?

175
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,640
Monica, you're Mom.

176
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,680
Oh, my God!

177
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
Okay, I'll be there.

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,680
That was my agent.

179
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,760
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,600
That's great!

181
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,600
What's the part?

182
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,800
Can you believe it? Pacino!

183
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,760
This guy's why I became an actor!

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
" Out of order? You' re out of order!

185
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,960
This whole courtroom's out of order! "

186
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,800
Seriously, what's the part?

187
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,640
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in! "

188
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,280
Come on. Seriously, Joey,
what's the part?

189
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,680
You' re.... What?

190
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,440
I' m his butt double, okay?

191
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
I play Al Pacino's butt.

192
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,920
All right? He goes into the shower,
and then...

193
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,200
... I' m his butt.

194
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,640
Oh, my God!

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
Come on, you guys.

196
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,400
It's a real Pacino movie
and that's big!

197
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,960
It's terrific. You deserve this.

198
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,280
After years of struggling you've

199
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,080
cracked your way into show business.

200
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,920
Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

201
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,520
This is a big break for me!

202
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
So, will you invite us
to the big opening?

203
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,680
So, will you invite us
to the big opening?

204
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,200
-I need some moisturizer.
-For what?

205
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,640
Today's the big day!

206
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,560
God. Go in the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

207
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,640
Don't ever tell me what you did
in there.

208
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,320
Thank you.

209
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,640
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-ln the bathroom.

210
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,680
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we' re roommates.

211
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,720
My eyes!
My eyes!

212
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
I warned you.

213
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,040
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,159
Who is being loud?

214
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,480
Oh, that would be Monica.

215
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,400
Can I borrow stuff?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

216
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,320
You got the whole night?

217
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,720
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so....

218
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,800
Do I sense resentment?

219
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,000
No. No resentment. Believe me...

220
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,200
...it's worth it, okay?

221
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,520
In a relationship, you have moments

222
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,120
you'll remember the rest of your life.

223
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,440
Every single second is like that
with Aurora.

224
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,040
I've just wasted 35 of them
talking to you.

225
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,240
So, Monica, can you
help me with the door?

226
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,920
The old Monica would remind you...

227
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,920
...to scrub that Teflon pan with
a plastic brush.

228
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,480
But l' m not gonna do that.

229
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,520
Everybody ready?

230
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,240
I wanna thank you
for this opportunity.

231
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Lose the robe.

232
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,520
Me?

233
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,200
That would work.

234
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,400
Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

235
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,040
Okay, and the robe is lost.

236
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,920
I would like to get this in one take.

237
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,400
Let's roll it.

238
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,520
Water's working.

239
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,960
And action!

240
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,400
And cut!

241
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,240
Butt guy, what are you doing?

242
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,920
I'm showering.

243
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,120
No, that was clenching.

244
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,000
The way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

245
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,360
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

246
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,840
I think his butt would be angry here.

247
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,400
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

248
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,120
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

249
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,240
And action!

250
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,800
And cut!

251
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,840
What was that?

252
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,440
I was going for quiet desperation.

253
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,880
But if you have to ask....

254
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,600
God, I love these fingers.

255
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,920
Thank you.

256
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,400
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

257
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,480
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

258
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,840
-Oh, my God, l' m late!
-Oh, no!

259
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,560
-Don't go.
-Okay.

260
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,160
-I have to.
-Look, she's leaving.

261
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,800
I' m sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

262
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,600
I thought you talked to Rick.

263
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,600
It's not Rick.

264
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,040
Ethan? He gets the whole day!

265
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,200
No, it's Andrew.

266
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,960
I know there'll be moments...

267
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,960
...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but....

268
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,520
And Andrew is?

269
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,600
He's...

270
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,720
... new.

271
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,040
So you' re not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

272
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,600
No, that's not exactly what I was

273
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,600
Most women would kill...

274
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,960
...for three guys like us.

275
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,080
So, what do you want?

276
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,160
You.

277
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,360
-You have me.
-No. Just you.

278
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,400
What do you mean?

279
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,880
Lose the other guys.

280
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
Like, all of them?

281
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,720
Come on, we' re great together.
Why not?

282
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,760
Can't we have what we have now?

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,240
Why can't we talk and make love...

284
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,320
...without feeling obligated
to each other?

285
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,920
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

286
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,960
Well, part of me wants that...

287
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,320
... but it's like l' m two guys.

288
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,240
One guy's saying, "This is great! "

289
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,120
But there's this other guy.

290
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
The guy who wells up
when the Grinch's heart grows...

291
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,600
...and breaks that measuring device.

292
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,440
He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out! "

293
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,240
So, which one of the guys
will you listen to?

294
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,440
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

295
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,040
Which one?

296
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,800
The second guy.

297
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,560
I see.

298
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,280
Call me if you change your mind.

299
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,680
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

300
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,440
Look at it this way. You dumped her!

301
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,720
Right? I mean, this woman was

302
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,520
unbelievably sexy...

303
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,440
...and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable.

304
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,480
Tell me why you did this again?

305
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,640
Movie star!

306
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Pacino movie?

307
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,640
Nope.

308
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,200
No? What happened, big guy?

309
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,280
Big guy?

310
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,760
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

311
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,880
I got fired!

312
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,440
They said I acted too much with it.

313
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,400
I told everybody about this!

314
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,520
Everybody's expecting to see me.

315
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,240
No one will be able to tell.

316
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,480
My mom will.

317
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
There's something so sweet

318
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,200
and disturbing about that.

319
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,240
I've done crappy plays
for six years...

320
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,320
...and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

321
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,200
Maybe this wasn't it.

322
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,200
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

323
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,920
Did it feel like your shot?

324
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,640
Hard to tell. I was naked.

325
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,360
I don't think this was it.

326
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
I don't think you just get one.

327
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,240
I believe things are gonna happen
for you. I do.

328
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,160
You've got to think about
the day some kid will go:

329
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,400
"l got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass! "

330
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,080
You think? That's so nice.

331
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,160
I' m sorry, Joey.
I' m gonna go to bed, guys.

332
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,520
Good night.

333
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,360
You' re gonna leave
your shoes out here?

334
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,960
Really? Just casually
strewn about...

335
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,880
...in that reckless, haphazard manner?

336
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,280
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

337
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,080
Whenever.

338
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,280
She is a kook.

339
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,680
<i>If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.</i>

340
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,200
<i>No, don 't do this!</i>

341
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,800
<i>This is stupid!</i>

342
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,520
<i>I don 't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna get them.</i>

343
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
<i>But then everyone will know..</i>

344
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,120
<i>Unless I get them, then wake up
really early and put them back.</i>

345
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,360
<i>I need help!</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:07,887
Terry, I know I haven't
worked here long. . .

2
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,407
. . .but I was wondering,
would it be possible. . .

3
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:13,610
. . .if I got a $ 100 advance
on my salary?

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,360
An advance?

5
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:17,927
So that I can spend
Thanksgiving with my family.

6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:22,211
Every year we ski in Vail, and
my father pays for my ticket. . .

7
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,683
. . .but I've started
this whole independent thing. . .

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,804
. . .which is actually why
I took this ''job. ''

9
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:33,085
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

10
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,206
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

11
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:39,486
Really, really awful.

12
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:43,926
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

13
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:49,805
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

14
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,883
I really do.

15
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:54,488
Does anybody need coffee?

16
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:02,083
The One Where Underdog Gets Away

17
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:04,361
English Subtitles by
MORPHZ fuckyeah.

18
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:49,928
Excuse me, sir?

19
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:52,686
You come in here all the time.
I was wondering. . .

20
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:56,726
. . .is there a possibility that
you could advance me my tips?

21
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:03,081
That's fine.
Sorry about that spill before!

22
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,603
Only 98.50 to go!

23
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:12,328
Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

24
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,449
What? No, they're not.

25
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,045
The Blymans invited them.

26
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:17,122
You're wrong.

27
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,927
I am not wrong.

28
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,082
You're wrong.

29
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:24,130
No, I just talked to them.

30
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:27,007
I'm calling Mom.

31
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:39,401
And this from the Cry for Help
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

32
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:46,528
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially
''Joey Tribbiani: actor/model. ''

33
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:50,605
I was thinking you
look more like ''Joey Tribbiani. . .

34
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:52,524
. . .man/woman. ''

35
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,526
What were you modeling?

36
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:57,842
You know those posters for
the City Free Clinic?

37
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:01,482
So you're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

38
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,802
The asthma guy's really cute.

39
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,290
Know which one you're gonna be?

40
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,722
But I hear Lyme disease is open, so. . . .

41
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:11,803
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

42
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,207
Thanks.

43
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:19,087
You were right.
How can they do this to us?

44
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,890
It's Thanksgiving!

45
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:23,088
How about if I cook dinner at my place?

46
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:24,765
I'll make it just like Mom's.

47
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,090
Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

48
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,282
They're not actually supposed to--

49
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:33,284
I'll work on the lumps.

50
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,128
Joey, you're going home, right?

51
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:40,081
Chandler, you're still boycotting
all the pilgrim holidays?

52
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:43,323
Yes. Every single one of them.

53
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:46,884
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
-And her boyfriend.

54
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:50,687
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

55
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,322
So you're free Thursday, then?

56
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,688
Yeah. Oh, can I come?

57
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,323
Rach, you still going to Vail?

58
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:06,484
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop!

59
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,802
Only $ 1 02 to go.

60
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:10,167
I thought it was 98.50?

61
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:12,972
Well, it was, but I broke a cup.

62
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,563
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

63
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:18,683
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

64
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,286
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife. . .

65
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:26,684
. . .and will probably want to bring
her ooh, ooh, lesbian life-partner.

66
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:37,521
Is Carol here?

67
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,808
No, she's at a faculty meeting.

68
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:43,891
I just came by to pick up my skull.

69
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:46,208
Well, not mine, but. . . .

70
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,091
Come in.

71
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:52,611
Carol borrowed it for a class, and I
have to get it back to the museum.

72
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:53,807
What's it look like?

73
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,807
Kind of like a big face without skin.

74
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:02,524
I'm familiar with the concept.

75
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,683
You can just look for it.

76
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:15,084
You guys sure have a lot of books
about being a lesbian.

77
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,127
You know, you have to take a course.

78
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,763
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

79
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:36,645
Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.

80
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:39,486
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

81
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:44,564
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

82
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,882
Wouldn't that mean you're. . .

83
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,281
. . .crazy?

84
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:52,285
What? You don't think they can
hear sounds in there?

85
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:54,927
You're not serious? I mean. . .

86
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:56,605
. . .you really talk to it?

87
00:05:57,132 --> 00:06:00,363
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

88
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:03,449
Do you talk about me?

89
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:06,248
All the time.

90
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,288
Really?

91
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:12,289
We just refer to you
as ''Bobo, the sperm guy. ''

92
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:27,482
If she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly-time too.

93
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,888
Not that I believe any of this.

94
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,568
I believe it. I think the baby can
totally hear everything.

95
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:36,563
I'll show you.
This will seem a little weird.

96
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:40,202
But you put your head
inside this turkey. . .

97
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:43,489
. . .and we'll all talk and you'll
hear everything we say.

98
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,887
I'd just like to say I'm totally
behind this experiment.

99
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:53,082
In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.

100
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:00,732
-Did you make your money?
-Not even close.

101
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,883
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.

102
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:06,488
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

103
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,121
Here's your mail.

104
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:13,488
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table.

105
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,283
Here's your mail!

106
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:21,488
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table!

107
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,690
Would you just open it!

108
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,089
Oh, my God!

109
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:31,290
You guys are great!

110
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,563
We all chipped in.

111
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:34,727
We did?

112
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,530
You owe me $20.

113
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:39,121
Thank you. Thank you so much!

114
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,441
Chandler, here you go.

115
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:43,047
Your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup. . .

116
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:47,126
. . .grilled-cheese fixings and
your family-size bag of Funyuns.

117
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:49,602
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?

118
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:52,286
What is it with you
and this holiday?

119
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:55,051
I'm 9 years old.

120
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,771
I hate this story!

121
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,889
We've just finished
Thanksgiving dinner.

122
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:00,923
I have-- I remember
this part vividly--

123
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:03,128
--a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

124
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:07,126
And this is the moment my parents
tell me they're getting divorced.

125
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:08,606
Oh, my God!

126
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:13,084
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

127
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:32,930
We used to work together.

128
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,048
We did?

129
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:37,684
At Macy's. You're
the Obsession girl, right?

130
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,283
I was the Aramis guy.

131
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,092
Aramis? Aramis?

132
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:46,327
Yeah, right!

133
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,362
You're the best in the business.

134
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,091
-Get out!
-I'm serious!

135
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:55,291
You're amazing! You know when to
spritz. You know when to lay back.

136
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:59,082
Really? You don't know
what that means to me.

137
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,768
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?

138
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,564
Nothing.

139
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,567
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?

140
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:21,485
Yeah, that would be--

141
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:25,730
-What's wrong?
-I remembered I have to do something.

142
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:27,691
What?

143
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:31,451
Leave.

144
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:33,688
Wait, wait, wait!

145
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:15,771
I guess you all saw it.

146
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,128
Saw what?

147
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:21,922
We're just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.

148
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:44,646
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

149
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:48,727
''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''

150
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,005
Looking good! Okay!

151
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:06,484
Cider's mulling, turkey's
turking, yams are yamming. . . .

152
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,526
What?

153
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:12,402
I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

154
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,766
That's it. Get out of
my way and stop annoying me!

155
00:11:16,012 --> 00:11:17,491
Well, that's closer.

156
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:20,485
I got the tickets!

157
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:24,520
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

158
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:27,127
Oh, you must stop shooping.

159
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:29,283
I'm gonna get my stuff.

160
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,644
Will you just come in, already?

161
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:35,362
I prefer to keep a safe distance
from all this merriment.

162
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,684
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

163
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:48,886
We all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

164
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:54,042
Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

165
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:55,890
That's not a question.

166
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,892
But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.

167
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:02,886
A piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!

168
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:05,482
I mean it's. . .

169
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:10,284
. . .bad enough I can't be with
my family, because of my disease.

170
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:12,928
All right. Fine.

171
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:16,323
Tonight's potatoes will be both
mashed with lumps. . .

172
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:18,688
. . .and in the form of Tots.

173
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:23,367
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

174
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,284
Mom never hit.

175
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,490
Okay, all done.

176
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:37,090
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?

177
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,691
Ross needs lumps!

178
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,723
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--

179
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:45,688
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

180
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,481
Why would we do that?

181
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:50,121
Then they'd be like
my mom used to make it. . .

182
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:51,600
. . .before she died.

183
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,891
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.

184
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,169
Goodbye, you guys!

185
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,481
Thanks for everything!

186
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:06,486
Oh, God, look at-- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:11,727
The most unbelievable thing has
happened! Underdog has gotten away!

188
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:12,728
The balloon?

189
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,447
No, the actual cartoon character.

190
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,848
Of course the balloon!

191
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:20,491
It's all over the news.

192
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:24,441
He broke free and was spotted
over Washington Square Park.

193
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,210
I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?

194
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,805
I can't. I gotta go!

195
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:31,488
An 80-foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?

196
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,284
Almost never.

197
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:34,887
Got the keys?

198
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:42,646
Anytime you're ready!

199
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,284
Okay, here we go.

200
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:54,491
Where am I talking to here?

201
00:13:55,852 --> 00:14:00,084
There is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but. . . .

202
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,805
Just aim for the bump.

203
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:09,290
Okay, here goes.

204
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,928
You know, I can't do this.

205
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:22,168
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

206
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:26,966
It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

207
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,483
Hello, baby!

208
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:36,121
--the moment we first saw the giant dog
shadow fall over the park!

209
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:39,409
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

210
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:44,402
Right about now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside. . .

211
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,290
. . .and juicy on the inside.

212
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,484
Why are we standing here?

213
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:52,968
We're waiting for you to open
the door. You've got the keys.

214
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:54,685
No, I don't.

215
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:59,521
Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, ''Got the keys. ''

216
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:01,889
No, I didn't. I asked. . .

217
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,248
. . . ''Got the keys?''

218
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,962
You said, ''Got the keys! ''

219
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:10,885
Either of you have the keys?

220
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:13,282
The oven is on!

221
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:14,971
I've gotta get my ticket!

222
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:16,850
Wait! We have a copy of your key.

223
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,081
Then get it!

224
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:20,562
That tone won't make me go any faster.

225
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:23,086
That one will.

226
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,290
And everyone's telling me,
''You gotta pick a major! ''

227
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:34,286
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

228
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:40,487
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

229
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:44,691
You're just happy you don't
have gills anymore.

230
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:48,811
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

231
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,612
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach.

232
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:54,805
How's it going?

233
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:56,883
Here we come

234
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,889
Walking down the street

235
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:02,920
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

236
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,491
Hey, hey--

237
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,325
-Did you feel that?
-I did.

238
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,722
-Does it always--?
-That was the first!

239
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,485
Keep singing! Keep singing!

240
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,483
Hey, hey, you're my baby

241
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,487
And I can 't wait to meet you

242
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:24,480
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo

243
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,970
I felt it that time!

244
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:28,531
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

245
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:31,491
I'm the one without any breasts

246
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:36,487
Not that one.

247
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,324
Can you go any faster?

248
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:42,485
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.

249
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,485
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

250
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,081
For an emergency just like this.

251
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,766
All right. Listen, smirky!

252
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,923
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon. . .

253
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:58,768
. . .I'd be on a plane watching a woman
do this right now. But I'm not!

254
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,411
I swear you said you had the keys!

255
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:05,212
I wouldn't say I had the
keys unless I had the keys!

256
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,323
I obviously did not have the keys!

257
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,484
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say ''keys'' !

258
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:15,282
Why would I have the keys!

259
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:17,843
Besides the fact that
you said you did?

260
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:20,202
-But I didn't!
-Well, you should have.

261
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:21,601
-Why?
-Because!

262
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,882
Because everything's
my responsibility?

263
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:26,447
Isn't it enough that I'm making
Thanksgiving dinner?

264
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:30,605
Everyone wants a different potato,
so I'm making different potatoes.

265
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:34,686
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want?

266
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:40,330
Just as long as Phoebe gets
her peas and onions. . .

267
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,483
. . .and Mario gets his Tots.

268
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:45,207
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

269
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:49,007
It's all burnt, and I can't. . . .

270
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,602
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.

271
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:56,286
Look, the door's open!
Here we go.

272
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,488
The turkey's burnt!

273
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:08,287
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

274
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,520
Here we come

275
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:12,883
Walking down the--

276
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,282
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

277
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:21,601
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.

278
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,968
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!

279
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:27,686
God, this is great!

280
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:31,009
The plane is gone, so I guess
I'm stuck here with you guys.

281
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:35,086
We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!

282
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,281
Oh, really?

283
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,366
So why was I busting my ass
to make this delicious dinner?

284
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:41,647
You call that delicious?

285
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:46,770
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

286
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:49,648
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

287
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:05,242
What?

288
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:08,848
Ugly Naked Guy's taking
his turkey out of the oven.

289
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:14,332
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

290
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:15,641
Ugly Naked Guy. . .

291
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,725
. . .is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

292
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:22,290
I gotta see this!

293
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:27,408
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

294
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:30,287
Ugly naked dancing!

295
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:33,407
It's nice that he has someone.

296
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:44,881
Shall I carve?

297
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:46,967
By all means.

298
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:55,885
Who wants light cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

299
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:59,685
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

300
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:02,681
-Does anybody want to split this?
-I will.

301
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,331
You guys have to make a wish.

302
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:06,162
Make a wish?

303
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,482
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

304
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:15,605
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?

305
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,084
The bigger half.

306
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,482
All right, I'd like to
propose a toast.

307
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,883
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

308
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,245
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned. . .

309
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:32,121
. . .but for me this has
been really great.

310
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:35,682
I think because it didn't
involve divorce. . .

311
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,484
. . .or projectile vomiting.

312
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,410
If you had gone to Vail. . .

313
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:45,088
. . .or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have. . .

314
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,171
. . .syphilis and stuff. . .

315
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,290
. . .we wouldn't be
all together.

316
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:54,006
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is. . .

317
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:58,882
. . .I'm very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

318
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:03,089
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.

319
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,288
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

320
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,488
And a crappy New Year!

1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,010
Guys? There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,138
Wait, wait. What is that?

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,932
That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,329
No, I don't.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,531
He is precious!
Where did you get him?

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,771
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,339
That is so cruel.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,617
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,451
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass!

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,378
Is he gonna live with you,
like, in your apartment?

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,578
It's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so. . . .

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,538
Why don't you just get a roommate?

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,537
I don't know.
You reach a certain age. . .

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,850
. . .having a roommate
is just kind of pathe--

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,656
Sorry, that's ''pathet,'' which is
Sanskrit for ''cool way to live. ''

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,816
The One With the Monkey

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,772
I'm doing all-new material tonight.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,538
I have 12 new songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,731
Might want to open with the snowman.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,853
So how'd it go?

22
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,698
I didn't get the job.

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,498
How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year!

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,733
I don't know. Some fat guy's
sleeping with the store manager.

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,417
He's not even jolly.
It's all political.

26
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,729
What are you gonna be?

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,737
I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,813
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,939
Hey, do you guys know
what you're doing for New Year's?

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,013
Hey, what? What is wrong
with New Year's?

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,333
Nothing for you. You have Paolo.
You don't have to face the pressure. . .

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,368
. . .of finding anything with lips
to kiss when the ball drops!

33
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,178
Man, I'm talking loud!

34
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,136
For your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

35
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,416
I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

36
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,139
Yeah, you wish.

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,094
I'm sick of being a victim
this Dick Clark holiday.

38
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,734
I say this year, no dates,
we make a pact.

39
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,857
Just the six of us. Dinner.

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,739
-Sure.
-Fine.

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,210
I was hoping for a little
more enthusiasm.

42
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,776
You're on.

43
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,339
Oh, good.

44
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,970
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand. . .

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,450
. . .Miss Phoebe Buffay.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,969
Thanks. Hi.

47
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,495
I want to start with a song that
means a lot to me this time of year.

48
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,578
I made a man with eyes of coal

49
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,892
And a smile so bewitchin '

50
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,968
How was I supposed to know

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,973
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,095
My mother's ashes

53
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,373
Even her eyelashes

54
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,938
Are resting in a little yellow jar

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,659
And sometimes when it's freezing

56
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,459
I feel a little sneezy

57
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,535
And now I--
Excuse me? Excuse me?

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,576
Noisy boys.

59
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,893
Is it something you'd like
to share with the group?

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,299
No, that's okay.

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,333
If it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing. . .

62
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,418
. . .I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

63
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,690
That guy's going home with a note.

64
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,656
-I was just saying--
-Could you speak up?

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,015
Sorry.

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,649
I was saying you were
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

67
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,532
And you said Daryl Hannah. . .

68
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,652
. . .was the most beautiful woman
he'd ever seen.

69
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,937
And I said I liked her in Splash,
but not in Wall Street.

70
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,893
-I thought she had a hard quality.
-A hard quality.

71
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,334
And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way. . .

72
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,016
. . .you are luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

73
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,492
Then that's when you started yelling.

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,136
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

75
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,132
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

76
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,418
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

77
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,729
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

78
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,775
I mean, by my sixth date with Paolo,
he'd already named both my breasts.

79
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,495
Did I just share too much?

80
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,492
Just a smidge.

81
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,530
David's, like, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

82
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,729
I think it's romantic.

83
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,015
Me too!

84
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,571
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

85
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,131
He's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

86
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,733
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

87
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,130
I just want to be
with him all the time.

88
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,531
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

89
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,174
And special occasions.

90
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,332
I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

91
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,140
You'll break the pact.
She's breaking the pact.

92
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,532
Yeah, could I just. . .?

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,450
Yeah, because I already asked Janice.

94
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,768
Come on, this was a pact!
This was your pact!

95
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,534
I couldn't handle the pressure
and I snapped!

96
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,573
But Janice?
That was the worst breakup in history!

97
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,254
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

98
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,057
Hi, sorry I'm late.

99
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,131
Too many jokes.

100
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,819
Must mock Joey.

101
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,171
Nice shoes, huh?

102
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,732
God, you're killing me!

103
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,736
He's playing with my spatulas again!

104
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,374
Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

105
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,451
Do you always have to bring him here?

106
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,652
I didn't want to leave him alone.

107
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,414
We had our first fight this morning.

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,811
It has to do with my working late.

109
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,018
I said some things that I didn't mean.

110
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,935
He threw some feces.

111
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,256
If you're working late,
I can look in on him.

112
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,931
That would be great!

113
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,133
But make sure it seems
like you're there to see him. . .

114
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,940
. . .and you're not doing it
as a favor to me.

115
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,092
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to lie.

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,810
But you can't actually
test this theory.

117
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,973
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough. . .

118
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,131
. . .to simulate these conditions.

119
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,251
All right. I have a question then.

120
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,011
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

121
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,050
That's definitely a valid question. . .

122
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,256
. . .and the answer. . .

123
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,695
. . .would be yes.

124
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,969
Yes, I was.

125
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,531
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss. . .

126
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,573
. . .that happened at this
phenomenal moment because it's you.

127
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,935
Sure.

128
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,928
Right. But the longer I waited,
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

129
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,059
And now, it's just got to be
one of those things where I. . .

130
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,372
. . .sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

131
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,134
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

132
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,254
Oh, David, I think you are
a ''sweeping sort of fella. ''

133
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,532
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

134
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,979
-Really.
-I'm sure of it.

135
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,973
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me.

136
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,016
Now?

137
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,813
Right now. Just. . . .

138
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,734
You know what?
This is just really expensive.

139
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,897
And this was a gift.

140
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,813
-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay, what the hell?

141
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,898
-You want me to actually throw you--?
-I can hop.

142
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,056
Tell me something, what does
''No-Date Pact'' mean to you?

143
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,373
I'm sorry. It's just that Chandler
has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.

144
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,497
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

145
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,691
Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend,
Fun Bobby?

146
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,534
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

147
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,333
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

148
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,573
Okay. Here we go.

149
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,493
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no room for milk.

150
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,736
There. Now there is.

151
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,212
So on our no-date evening, three
of you now are gonna have dates.

152
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,456
-Four.
-Four.

153
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,928
-Five.
-Five.

154
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,180
Sorry. Paolo's catching
an earlier flight.

155
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,776
And I met this really hot
single mom at the store.

156
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,978
What's an elf to do?

157
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,812
So I'm gonna be the only one standing
there alone when the ball drops?

158
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,735
Come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

159
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,857
This is so not what I needed now.

160
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,010
What's the matter?

161
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,613
Oh, it's Marcel.

162
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,973
He keeps shutting me out.

163
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,735
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

164
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,218
That's weird. I had a blast
with him the other night.

165
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,331
-Really?
-We played. We watched TV.

166
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,969
That juggling thing is amazing.

167
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,731
What juggling thing?

168
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,292
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

169
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,535
It wasn't that big a deal.
Just balled-up socks.

170
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,255
And a melon.

171
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,650
-Phoebe! Hi!
-Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

172
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,618
No. Have you seen David?

173
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,453
No, he hasn't been around.

174
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,931
If you see him, tell him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

175
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,330
Minsk?

176
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,132
Minsk. It's in Russia.

177
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,096
I know where Minsk is.

178
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,535
We got the grant!

179
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,459
Three years, all expenses paid.

180
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,368
So when do you leave?

181
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,496
January 1 st.

182
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,532
-What are you doing here?
-Max told me about Minsk.

183
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,977
So, you know, congratulations!
This is so exciting!

184
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,691
It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

185
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,894
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

186
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,850
Tell her, David.

187
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,332
''I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

188
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,014
I want to stay here and make out
with my girlfriend! ''

189
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,572
Okay, thank you, Max.
Thank you.

190
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,572
So you're really not going?

191
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,857
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just. . . .

192
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,456
You decide.

193
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,135
-Don't do that.
-Please?

194
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,329
But I'm asking you.

195
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,979
I can't make a decision.

196
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,972
-Please, just--
-Okay. Stay.

197
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,499
-Stay.
-Stay.

198
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,938
Getting so good at that!

199
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,258
It was Max's stuff.

200
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,970
I love this artichoke thing.

201
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,576
Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

202
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,139
You remember Janice.

203
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,289
Vividly.

204
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,450
Hi, I'm Sandy.

205
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,816
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

206
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,336
You brought your kids.

207
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,252
Yeah. That's okay, right?

208
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,899
Party!

209
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,654
That thing is not coming in here!

210
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,131
''That thing''? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

211
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,009
If I showed up with my new girlfriend,
she wouldn't be welcome?

212
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,492
Your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

213
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,817
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

214
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,175
And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here. . .

215
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,419
. . .like nothing happened. . . .

216
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,452
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

217
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,895
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

218
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,655
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

219
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,054
All right. . .

220
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,931
. . .I'll catch up with you later.

221
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,892
Oh, my God! Rachel, honey. . .

222
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,698
. . .are you okay?

223
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,969
Where's Paolo?

224
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,609
Rome.

225
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,612
Jerk missed his flight.

226
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,573
And then your face exploded?

227
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,139
I was at the airport
getting into a cab. . .

228
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,659
. . .when this woman. . .

229
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,494
. . .this blond planet
with a pocketbook. . .

230
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,574
. . .starts yelling at me.

231
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,334
Something about how
it was her cab first.

232
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,414
The next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair!

233
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,379
And I started blowing my attack
whistle thingy. . .

234
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,134
. . .and then three more cabs show up.

235
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,777
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me!

236
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,135
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

237
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,896
Everybody having fun at the party?

238
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,135
Are people eating my dip?

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,969
When I saw you at the store
last week. . .

240
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,818
. . .it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

241
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,851
Wow, that's dirty!

242
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,016
Hey, kids.

243
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,856
Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me. . .

244
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,772
. . .but at least check in.

245
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,051
There you are!

246
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,060
You got away from me.

247
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,291
But you found me.

248
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,218
Here, Ross, take our picture.

249
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,696
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

250
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,138
Kill me. Kill me now.

251
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,732
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

252
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,935
Hey, sorry I'm late.

253
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,131
But my grandfather. . .

254
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,978
. . .died about two hours ago.

255
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,059
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so. . .

256
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,774
. . .here I am.

257
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,415
Hey, Fun Bobby!
How's it going, man?

258
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,334
Whoa! Who died?

259
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,373
It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

260
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,218
So at least I'll get to see him again.

261
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,571
I'm gonna blow this one up and
I'm gonna write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

262
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,776
All right, Janice, that's it!

263
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,258
When I invited you, I didn't
think it meant that we--

264
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,650
Oh, no!

265
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,855
-I'm sorry you misunderstood.
-Oh, my God!

266
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,336
You listen to me!
You listen to me!

267
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,131
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me!

268
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,851
Will you give me the thing?

269
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,176
Hi, Max.

270
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,655
Yoko.

271
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,697
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

272
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,132
It won't be the same. . .

273
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,932
. . .but it will still be Minsk.

274
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,698
Happy New Year.

275
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,539
Are you all right?

276
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,817
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

277
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,455
You're going to Minsk.

278
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,531
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

279
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,332
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

280
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,458
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

281
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,772
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

282
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,137
-And I can't break up with you.
-Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

283
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,572
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

284
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,412
That's what I have to do now. ''

285
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,413
And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''

286
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,575
And then you say,
''It's tearing me apart. . .

287
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,334
. . .but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?''

288
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,252
And I say, ''No!

289
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,139
No! I can't understand that! ''

290
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,170
Sorry.

291
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,380
And then you put
your arms around me. . . .

292
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,333
Put your arms around me.

293
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,695
Sorry.

294
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,290
And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

295
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,535
I'll never forget you.

296
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,579
Then you say that it's almost
midnight and you have to go. . .

297
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,211
. . .because you don't want to start
the year with me if you can't finish it.

298
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,739
I'm gonna miss you. . .

299
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,852
. . .you scientist guy.

300
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,017
Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.

301
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,936
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

302
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,818
It gets better every year.

303
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,413
Here you go, kids.

304
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,934
And then the peacock bit me.

305
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,452
Please kiss me at midnight!

306
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,250
You seen Sandy?

307
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,775
I don't know how to tell you this. . .

308
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,808
. . .but she's in the bedroom getting it
on with Max, that scientist geek.

309
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,529
Cool, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

310
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,935
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

311
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,129
What?

312
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,891
The ball is dropping!

313
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,695
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

314
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,539
And the moment of joy is upon us.

315
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,938
Looks like that ''No-Date Pact'' thing
worked out.

316
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,729
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!

317
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,135
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby!

318
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,934
--four, three, two. . .

319
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,859
. . .one! Happy New Year!

320
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,658
I just thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz. . .

321
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,132
. . .but I do believe there are
three girls and three guys right here.

322
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,773
I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

323
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,738
I can't kiss anyone.

324
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,658
So I'm kissing everyone?

325
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,416
You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

326
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,059
Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

327
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,528
Somebody kiss me.

328
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,369
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!

329
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,451
All right! All right! All right!

330
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,809
There!

331
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,568
I wanted this to work so much.

332
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,858
I'm still in there, you know?

333
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,012
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

334
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,735
But he's just phoning it in.

335
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,648
It's hard to accept
that something you love so much. . .

336
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,016
. . .doesn't love you back, you know?

337
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,738
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.

Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:07,569
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:12,405
Oh, my God! Don't Iook now.
Behind you there's a guy...

4
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:16,878
...who can break our hearts
and plunge us into depression.

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,012
Come to mama.

6
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,121
He's coming.
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,586
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,786
-We should do something. Whistle.
-I' m not whistling.

9
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,019
Come on, do it!

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,425
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,169
I can't believe you did that.

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:43,268
The One With Mrs. Bing

13
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,682
-It's all my fault.
-No, it's mine.

14
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,551
Why did I whoo-hoo?

15
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,057
Was I hoping
he'd turn around and say...

16
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,424
... " I Iove that sound.
I must have you now"?

17
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,998
I wish there was something
we could do.

18
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,765
Hello, coma guy.

19
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,666
Get up, you Girl Scout!
Up, up, up!

20
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,070
What are you doing?

21
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,244
Maybe nobody's tried this.

22
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,381
I wish we at Ieast knew his name.

23
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,315
I hate that they're
calling him John Doe.

24
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,116
It's so sad. It's Iike he's a deer,
a female deer.

25
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,986
Oh, I was gonna stop.

26
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,257
Look at that face.

27
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,726
Even sleeping he Iooks smart.

28
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:17,391
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles
mean he's artistic.

29
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:22,035
Okay. He's a Iawyer who teaches
sculpting on the side.

30
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,833
And he can dance.

31
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:28,877
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's Iistening...

32
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,845
... not saying, " I understand "...

33
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,144
... but really wondering
what you Iook Iike naked.

34
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,251
I wish all guys could be Iike him.

35
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,085
I know.

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,200
You don't even know this guy.

37
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,963
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

38
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,235
He doesn't have anyone.

39
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,601
We feel kind of responsible.

40
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,835
I can't believe you said "whoo-hoo. "

41
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,004
I don't even say "whoo-hoo. "

42
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,840
Oh, she's coming up.

43
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:09,784
When we return, we 'll talk with
the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.

44
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,082
Put the kids to bed for this one.

45
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,852
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie 's
is on Showtime and HBO.

46
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,027
No way.

47
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:21,193
-She's your mom.
-Exactly. Weekend at Bernie 's.

48
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,961
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

49
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,435
I gotta tell you,
I Iove your mom's books.

50
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,371
I can't get on a plane without one.
This is so cool.

51
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,046
You wouldn't think so
if you were 1 1...

52
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:39,775
...and your friends were passing around
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

53
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,580
I remember page 79.

54
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:47,192
The thing after the opera
with the girl with the trick hip?

55
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,926
I Iove your mom.
I think she's a blast.

56
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,995
That's because she's not your mom.

57
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,598
Oh, please. She's the

58
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,633
Hi, sweetie.

59
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,338
When did " Rigatoni " get back from Rome?

60
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,107
-Last night.
-Really?

61
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,576
So, his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

62
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,713
Just a dream I had.

63
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,176
But, phew!

64
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,850
Hey, she's on.

65
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,515
Nora Bing.

66
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:25,521
Back to the book. What is this
about you being arrested in London?

67
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,457
Your mom was arrested?

68
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,658
I'm busy beaming with pride.

69
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,233
This is kind of embarrassing...

70
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,639
...but occasionally, after
I've been intimate with a man...

71
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,341
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

72
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,678
...I just get this craving
for kung pao chicken.

73
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,976
That's too much information.

74
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:54,119
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.

75
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,353
Oh, God, I Iove her!

76
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,032
I think I' m having a stroke.

77
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,065
So how is your book tour going?

78
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,298
Oh, fine. I'm leaving
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

79
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,736
But I get to see my son, who I love.

80
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,310
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

81
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:21,653
Don 't take this wrong, I just
don 't see you as a mom.

82
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,756
-I don 't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

83
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,383
I bought my son his first condoms.

84
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,766
And then he burst into flames.

85
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,778
Let's see. Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction bill.

86
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:54,884
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.
The high today was 45.

87
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,083
And teams played sports.

88
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,117
What about GIen?

89
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,714
He could be a GIen.

90
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,785
Not special enough.

91
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,221
How about Agamemnon?

92
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,851
Way too special.

93
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,233
I'm famished. What do I want?

94
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,735
PIease, God, don't Iet it be
kung pao chicken.

95
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,841
You watched the show.
What did you think?

96
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,672
I think you need to come out
of your shell.

97
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,177
What is this dive?

98
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,783
Only you could've picked this place.

99
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,582
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

100
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,789
I heard about the divorce.
Lesbian, huh?

101
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:15,925
Well, you know what they say:
Be careful what you wish for.

102
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,070
-I think we' re ready for some tequila.
-I know I am.

103
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,265
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

104
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,636
There you go. Ross?

105
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,735
I' m not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

106
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,574
Hi. Sorry we' re Iate.

107
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,308
We kind of just, you know,
Iost track of time.

108
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,488
But a man can change.

109
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,856
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

110
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,409
Well, I' m gonna go to tinker-town.

111
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,740
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've written.

112
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:07,076
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,
I wanted to become a writer.

113
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,016
Oh, please.
If I can do it, anybody can.

114
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,617
Start with half a dozen
European cities...

115
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,521
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia...

116
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,161
...and you've got yourself a book.

117
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,024
My mother, Iadies and gentlemen.

118
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,972
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

119
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,603
-You okay, slugger?
-Oh, yeah. I' m fine.

120
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,019
What is with you tonight?

121
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,888
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

122
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,062
Okay, thank you.

123
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,964
It's the Italian hand-Iicker, isn't it?

124
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,738
No. It's the one he's Iicking.

125
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,671
She's supposed to be with you.

126
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,703
You' re good.

127
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:11,547
I have sold 1 00 million copies
of my books, and you know why?

128
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,976
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

129
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:21,860
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in Iove with.

130
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,059
I cannot sell a Paolo.

131
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,493
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

132
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,863
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

133
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,368
He's just a complication
you eventually kill off.

134
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,937
When?

135
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,409
He's not a hero.

136
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,843
You know who our hero is?

137
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,610
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

138
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,752
No, it's you.

139
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,454
-PIease.
-No, really.

140
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,089
Come on. You' re smart. You' re sexy.

141
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,454
-Right.
-Yes, you are.

142
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,256
The fact that you don't think you are
makes you sexier.

143
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,458
Come on, kiddo.
You' re gonna be fine, believe me.

144
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,013
I'II just pee in the street.

145
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,289
Is Chandler here?

146
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,165
Wait. Come here.

147
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,970
Okay, about Iast night...

148
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,071
...you know...

149
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,242
... Chandler, you didn't tell....

150
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,877
We don't need to tell Chandler.
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

151
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,979
Right. No big deal.

152
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,878
In bizarro world.

153
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,516
You broke the code.

154
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,658
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

155
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,454
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-Iooking aunt.

156
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,098
But not a mom. Never a mom.

157
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,926
What are you guys doing out here?

158
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,733
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an early morning racquetball game.

159
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,270
But apparently somebody overslept.

160
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,116
Well, you don't have your racquet.

161
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,012
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

162
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,446
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

163
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,659
Well, you didn't call
and Ieave your grip size.

164
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,862
You guys are spending
way too much time together.

165
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,334
I' m scum. I' m scum.

166
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,036
-How could you Iet this happen?
-I don't know.

167
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,170
It's not Iike she's a regular mom.

168
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,204
She's sexy. She's....

169
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,707
You don't think my mom's sexy?

170
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,573
Well, not in the same way.

171
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,808
I'II have you know, GIoria T ribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

172
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,624
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven children?

173
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,554
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

174
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,229
What are you doing here?

175
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,598
Not playing racquetball.

176
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,936
-He forgot to Ieave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggles.

177
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,446
Sounds Iike you two have issues.

178
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,710
Goodbye, baby.

179
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,453
Do they wait for me to do this?

180
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,624
-Are you gonna tell him?
-Why would I tell him?

181
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,265
If you don't, his mother might.

182
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,002
What are you guys doing here?

183
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,838
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

184
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,472
What did I ask?

185
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,490
What are you doing here?

186
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,826
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after...

187
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,330
...that I, you know.

188
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,368
So, what are you doing here?

189
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,270
I' m not really here.

190
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:34,002
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

191
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,281
Do you come here a Iot...

192
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,279
...without me?

193
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,647
No, no, no.

194
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,326
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

195
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,355
How would I know? I wasn't here.

196
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,966
Really? Not even
to change his pajamas?

197
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,096
Oh, my God.

198
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,072
You're my friend.
I had to tell you.

199
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,005
I can't believe it.

200
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,378
Paolo kissed my mom?

201
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,912
I don't know if you noticed,
but he drank a Iot.

202
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,781
I mean, you know how he gets

203
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,593
I can't do this. I did it.

204
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,228
It was me. I' m sorry.
I kissed your mom.

205
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,730
What?

206
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:31,066
I was upset about Rachel and
I had too much tequila, and Nora...

207
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,101
... Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...

208
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,372
... being nice.
But nothing happened.

209
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,736
Nothing. Ask Joey.

210
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,046
-Joey came in
-You knew about this?

211
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,011
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

212
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,217
Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,220
You're Iucky I caught them, or else
who knows what would've happened?

214
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,891
Thanks, man. Big help.

215
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,720
What the hell were you thinking?

216
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,987
I wasn't. I don't know. I

217
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,565
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

218
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,998
-I know.
-I can't believe you did this.

219
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,501
-Me neither.
-I' m mad at you too.

220
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,502
-Why are you mad at me?
-Let me slam the door.

221
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,841
I didn't kiss her. See what happens
when you break the code?

222
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,287
"A Woman Undone,
by Rachel IKaren Greene. "

223
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,865
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

224
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:41,038
Do you think his "Iove stick" can be
"Iiberated from its denim prison"?

225
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,936
Yeah, I'd say so.

226
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,508
And there's no "J " in "engorged. "

227
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,547
-You going to the hospital tonight?
-No. You?

228
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,320
No. You?

229
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,985
You just asked me.

230
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,186
Maybe it was a trick question.

231
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,364
Rachel, can we do this now?

232
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,138
I am so hot.

233
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,733
Here's my mom and dad
on their wedding day.

234
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,002
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

235
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:28,410
-I can't believe this conversation.
-Just try to picture her not pregnant.

236
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:33,852
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

237
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:35,825
Thanks.

238
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,930
I'd Iike to start with a song
about a man I recently met...

239
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,968
...who's come to be
very important to me.

240
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,007
You don 't have to be awake
To be my man

241
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:02,185
Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand

242
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,850
Though we just met the other day

243
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,561
There 's something I have got to say

244
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,665
Thank you very much.
I' m gonna take a short break.

245
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,627
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

246
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,535
-What the hell was that?
-Phoebe just started

247
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,075
I was talking to Joey.
AII right, there, mother-kisser?

248
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,342
" Mother-kisser. "

249
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,048
I'II shut up.

250
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,823
I know you' re still mad at me...

251
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,856
... but there were two people
there that night.

252
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,398
-There were two sets of Iips.
-I expect this from her.

253
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,367
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

254
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,696
Then why don't you say something?

255
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,897
Because it's complicated.
It's complex.

256
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,608
You kissed my mom.

257
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,674
We' re rehearsing a Greek play.

258
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,913
That's funny.
Are we done now?

259
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,384
You mean you' re not gonna
tell her how you feel?

260
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,786
Just because you played
tonsil tennis with my mom...

261
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,189
...doesn't mean you know her.
You can't talk to her.

262
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,727
Okay. "You can't"?
Or you can't?

263
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,533
Okay, that's my finger.

264
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,259
Okay, that's my knee.

265
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,038
Still doing the play.

266
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,139
What did you do with him?

267
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,284
-You're awake.
-Look at you.

268
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,489
How do you feel?

269
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,783
A Iittle woozy, but basically okay.

270
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,893
Gosh, you Iook good.

271
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,494
I feel good.

272
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,231
Who are you?

273
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,092
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe.

274
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,826
I' m Monica.
I've been caring for you.

275
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,003
We both have.

276
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,364
-The Etch A Sketch is from you?
-Actually, me.

277
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,304
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

278
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,876
-I read to you.
-I sang.

279
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,448
Well, thanks.

280
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,981
-Oh, my pleasure.
-You' re welcome.

281
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,088
So I guess I'II see you around.

282
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,087
What? That's it?

283
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,254
"See you around "?

284
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,589
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

285
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,129
Maybe...

286
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,698
... "That was nice. "

287
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,300
" It meant something to me. "

288
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,005
" I'II call you. "

289
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,598
-Okay. I'II call you.
-I don't think you mean that.

290
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,678
This is so typical.

291
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,811
You know, we give and we give...

292
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,644
...and we give.

293
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,981
And we just get nothing back.

294
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,125
And then one day, you wake up,
and it's, "See you around. "

295
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,795
Let's go, Phoebe.

296
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,235
You know what?
We thought you were different.

297
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,631
But I guess it was just the coma.

298
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:21,008
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

299
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,951
Autographed.
And give you a goodbye kiss.

300
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,024
Here's the kiss,
here's the goodbye....

301
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,863
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you' re there is enough.

302
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,663
AII right. Well, be good.
I Iove you.

303
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,239
You kissed my best Ross.

304
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,768
Or something to that effect.

305
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,852
Look, it was stupid.

306
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,248
-Really stupid.
-Really stupid.

307
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,991
I don't even know how it happened.

308
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:06,991
I' m sorry, honey. I promise
it will never happen again.

309
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,996
Really, really stupid.

310
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,635
Really, really stupid.

311
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,238
-Are we okay now?
-Yeah.

312
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,835
No.

313
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,277
The forbidden Iove
of a man and his door.

314
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,384
He told her off. And not just
about the kiss.

315
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,647
You're kidding?

316
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:35,293
He said, "When are you gonna
start being a mom? "

317
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:36,654
Then she said:

318
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:41,298
"The question is, when are you gonna
realize I have a bomb? "

319
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,267
Are you sure she didn't say:

320
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,271
"When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom? "

321
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,408
-That makes more sense.
-You think?

322
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,347
What's going on now?

323
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,786
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

324
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,220
I don't hear anything. Wait.

325
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,480
What do you see?

326
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,159
It's hard to tell.
They're tiny and upside down.

327
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,726
Wait, wait, wait.

328
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,058
They're walking away.
They're walking away.

329
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,103
No, they' re not. They' re coming
right at us. Run!

330
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,097
-Are you okay, kiddo?
-Yeah, I' m okay.

331
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,139
AII right. You be good.

332
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,003
Drive safe.

333
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,279
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. Geller.

334
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,617
You mean that?

335
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,693
Yeah, why not?

336
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,124
So I told her.

337
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,401
-How did it go?
-Awful. Awful.

338
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,330
Couldn't have gone worse.

339
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,171
-Well, how do you feel?
-Pretty good.

340
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,575
I told her.

341
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,743
Well, see?

342
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:07,281
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
me kissing your mom, huh?

343
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,751
But we don't have to
go down that road.

344
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,720
This is just the first chapter...

345
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:23,559
...and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

346
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,297
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her " heaving beasts. "

347
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,832
She could have heaving beasts.

348
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,503
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

349
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,340
What's a " niffle"?

350
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,484
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

351
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,817
Okay, so I' m not a great typist.

352
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:49,049
Did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

353
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,620
You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

354
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,425
That's it. Give them back.

355
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:01,836
Wait, I just got to the part
about her "public hair. "

00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,681
No, no, we're done!

2
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,388
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

3
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,639
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

4
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,778
If you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna...

5
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,447
... I would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

6
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,580
The meat's only every third layer.
Maybe you could scrape.

7
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,513
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

8
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:08,820
You could plunk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass...

9
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,256
...and I could find my way
out like that!

10
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,325
This is cool.

11
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:18,901
It says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

12
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,902
And we're done with the yogurt.

13
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,668
Sorry.

14
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,679
I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

15
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,352
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

16
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,317
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

17
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,552
You kiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

18
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:45,453
Ross, listen. Do you know that right
now your baby is only this big?

19
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,758
This is your baby.
" Hi, Daddy. "

20
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,290
Hello.

21
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,669
" How come you don't live with Mommy? "

22
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,368
" How come Mommy lives
with that other lady? "

23
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,242
"What's a lesbian? "

24
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,383
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

25
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:16,119
Poconos. It's like " poke a nose. "

26
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,090
Poke a nose.

27
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,903
-So did I hear Poconos?
-Yes.

28
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,410
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

29
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,344
First weekend together.

30
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,916
-It's a big step.
-I know.

31
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,314
-It's just a weekend. Big deal.
-Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

32
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,149
Shouldn't it be...

33
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,256
...flung by now?

34
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,157
We are way past a "fling. "

35
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:56,392
I' m feeling things I've read about
in Danielle Steel books.

36
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,470
When l' m with him,
l' m just totally....

37
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,435
Nauseous.
I' m physically nauseous.

38
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,968
What am I supposed to do?
Call lmmigration?

39
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,678
I could call lmmigration.

40
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,119
What?

41
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,918
Ugly Naked Guy is making
shadow puppets.

42
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,695
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.

43
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,597
Oh, right!

44
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,459
Go. Go!

45
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,336
I love babies with
their little baby shoes...

46
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,537
...and their little baby toes
and their little hands....

47
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,343
Okay, you' re gonna have to stop that.
Forever.

48
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,896
Need a new table.

49
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,758
You think?

50
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,299
-Come on in.
-Hello.

51
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,042
I brought the books...

52
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,911
...and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

53
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:19,278
Great! Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

54
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,551
I' m pretty sure that it is.

55
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,857
Nineteen weeks, the breasts
are starting to swell.

56
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,293
According to the literature.

57
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,198
-I got the results of the amnio.
-T ell me. Is everything...?

58
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,432
-T otally and completely healthy.
-That is great!

59
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,611
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

60
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,876
That's our friend T anya.

61
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,894
Of course, it's your friend T anya.

62
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,998
-Don't you wanna know about the sex?
-The sex?

63
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,805
I' m having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

64
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,137
But when you throw in T anya....

65
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,483
The sex of the baby, Ross.

66
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,645
You know the sex of the baby?

67
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,489
-Want to know?
-No.

68
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,019
I don't want to. Absolutely not.

69
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,220
You shouldn't know until
you look down there...

70
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,432
...and see, " Oh, there it is. "

71
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,499
Or isn't.

72
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,738
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

73
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:48,963
So?

74
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,903
So did you hear?

75
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,270
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-Okay.

76
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,970
Oh, that's so cool!

77
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,647
It really is.

78
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,177
Do we know?

79
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,387
We certainly do.
It's going to be a

80
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,612
Hello?

81
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,453
A guy who doesn't wanna know
is standing here.

82
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,823
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

83
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,097
What?

84
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,372
What did we think it'd be?

85
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,735
I don't wanna know.
Don't wanna know.

86
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,810
I should probably just go.

87
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,775
-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem. Okay.

88
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,182
Susan.

89
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:47,065
Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

90
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,202
Hello?

91
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,470
Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.

92
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:01,070
Because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

93
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,148
-That's the rule.
-What rule? There's no rule.

94
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,843
-You owe me a table.
-How did you get there?

95
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:14,083
It was fine until your breakfast
adventure with Angela Delvecio.

96
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,018
You knew about that?

97
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,529
The impressions in the butter
left little to the imagination.

98
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,235
How about if we split it?

99
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,230
-What do you mean, buy it together?
-Yeah.

100
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,769
-Do you think we' re ready for that?
-Why not?

101
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,937
It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

102
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,275
-You' re moving out?
-l' m not.

103
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,850
-You'd tell me if you were, right?
-Yes.

104
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:45,490
-It's just, with my last roommate
-I know all about Kip.

105
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:50,788
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off
and got married. Things got ugly.

106
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,661
Let me ask you something.
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

107
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,865
Oh, don't do that.

108
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,970
There's changes in your schedule.

109
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,272
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:30.

110
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,541
And Miss Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

111
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,977
Thanks.

112
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,182
Oh, here comes your 3:00.

113
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,184
I don't mean to sound unprofessional,
but Yum!

114
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,491
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

115
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,769
Rachella tell me you...

116
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,495
... massage?

117
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,272
Well, Rachella's right.

118
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,242
Oh, okay.

119
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,711
I don't know what you just said,
so let's start.

120
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,413
I am...

121
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,414
... being naked?

122
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,521
That's your decision.
Some people prefer to take off

123
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,825
Being naked!

124
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:05,226
I can't believe you don't
wanna know. I couldn't not know.

125
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,271
If the doctor knows,
Carol and Susan know

126
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,140
And Monica knows.

127
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,171
How? I don't even know.

128
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,837
Carol called to thank me
for the lasagna. She told me.

129
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,946
So what's it gonna be?

130
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:26,648
-Oh, great! Now he knows.
-l' m just excited about being an aunt.

131
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,384
Or an uncle.

132
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,726
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Hey, Pheebs.

133
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:36,959
Fine!

134
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,802
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. I' m just out of sorts.

135
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,707
Well, you can use some of my sorts.
I rarely use them.

136
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,708
Can we get some cappuccino
over here?

137
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,912
Oh, right! That's me!

138
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,548
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

139
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,984
Fine.

140
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:02,952
What is it?

141
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:08,232
-All right. You know Paolo?
-l' m familiar with his work.

142
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,263
He made a move on me.

143
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,997
-The store will be open tomorrow.
-More coffee, please.

144
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,232
Well, what happened?

145
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,572
He came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until....

146
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,686
-Oh, my God.
-Are you sure?

147
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,450
Oh, yeah. I' m sure.

148
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,292
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

149
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,559
Was it...?

150
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,968
Boy Scouts could've camped
under there.

151
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,702
Wow.

152
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,609
-What did you do?
-I dealt with it like a professional.

153
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,614
" Ooh, " what?

154
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,916
ma Thurman.

155
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,219
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

156
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,485
Thanks, Rach.

157
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,867
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

158
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,733
It's your moral obligation as a friend,
as a woman. It's a feminist issue.

159
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:22,965
Guys?

160
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,608
-You have to.
-Feminist issue? That's where I went.

161
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,615
-She is gonna hate me!
-Yeah, well....

162
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,255
Will you pick one?
Just pick one.

163
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,419
-Here, how about that one?
-That's patio furniture.

164
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:50,401
So what? Like people will come in
and think, " Oh, l' m outside again. "

165
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,695
Fine.

166
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,738
What about the birds?

167
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,942
I don't know. They don't say,
" Hello, sit here. Eat something. "

168
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:04,174
-You pick one.
-Okay. How about the ladybugs?

169
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,580
Forget about the birds, but big red
insects suggest fine dining.

170
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:13,219
-Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!
-Not like that, I won't.

171
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,694
Kip would have liked the birds.

172
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,443
-Hi, Pheebs.
-What's going on?

173
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,239
-Are you moving out?
-l' m getting ready for the weekend.

174
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,712
Are your weekends longer
than two days?

175
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,444
These aren't all my suitcases.

176
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,087
This one's Paolo's.

177
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,328
-Rachel, can we talk for a sec?
-Well, sure.

178
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,930
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

179
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,974
We haven't known each other that long.

180
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,911
There are three things
you should know:

181
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:16,577
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

182
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,653
Two, I never lie.

183
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,792
And three, I make the best
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

184
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,862
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

185
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,530
-Oh, my God!
-I know.

186
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,969
Why have I never tasted these?

187
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:44,046
I don't make them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other cookies.

188
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,181
These are the best
oatmeal raisin cookies.

189
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,086
-Which proves that I never lie.
-I guess you don't.

190
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,064
Paolo made a pass at me.

191
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,663
What do you think?

192
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,736
It's the most beautiful table
I've seen.

193
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,133
I know.

194
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,138
Will you balance plates
on these heads?

195
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,005
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink.
Come on!

196
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,872
Heads up, Ross.

197
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,381
Score! You suck!

198
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:24,853
Are you okay?

199
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,257
I need some mik.

200
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,031
Okay. I've got milk.

201
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,435
Here you go.

202
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,480
Better?

203
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,344
No.

204
00:15:54,787 --> 00:16:00,054
I feel so stupid! I think about
the other day with you guys.

205
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,887
And I was all, " Oh, Paolo!
He's so great!

206
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,824
He makes me feel so"

207
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,792
God!

208
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,026
I' m so embarrassed!

209
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,793
I' m so embarrassed.

210
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,440
-l' m the one he hit on.
-I unleashed him on you.

211
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,472
If I had never met him

212
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,769
-l' m so sorry.
-No, l' m sorry.

213
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,309
-l' m sorry.
-l' m sorry. Wait.

214
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,105
-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.

215
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,375
Right. He's the pig.

216
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,316
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

217
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,992
He's like a big disgusting pig....

218
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,557
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

219
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,893
But he was my pig man!

220
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,265
How did I not see this?

221
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,967
Oh, I know!

222
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,340
Because...

223
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,581
... he's gorgeous.

224
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,406
And he's charming.

225
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,380
-And when he looks
-Okay, Pheebs.

226
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,111
The end.

227
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,480
God.

228
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,586
Should I not have told you?

229
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,696
T rust me, it's much better
that I know.

230
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,929
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.

231
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,649
She took it pretty well.
Paolo's over there now, so....

232
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:47,328
We should go and see if she's okay.
Just one second.

233
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,065
-Score!
-Game! Nice!

234
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,566
Come on, Pheebs.

235
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,177
Well, it looks like we
kicked your butts.

236
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,508
She did. You could be on the Olympic
"Standing There" team.

237
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,182
Come on. Two on one.

238
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,012
Why are you here?
She just broke up with him.

239
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,518
It's time for you to swoop in.

240
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,920
-What, now?
-Yes. Now is when you swoop.

241
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,994
When Paolo walks out,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

242
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,963
She's gotta know you' re everything
he's not. You' re the anti-Paolo.

243
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,637
My Catholic friend is right.

244
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,433
She's distraught.
You' re there for her.

245
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:35,443
You pick up the pieces and then
you usher in "The Age of Ross. "

246
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,949
-See this? See?
-Hold it! Ascolta!

247
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,227
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

248
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,389
She threw his clothes off the balcony.
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

249
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,196
That is, " How could you? "
or " Enormous breasts! "

250
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,935
Here he comes.

251
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,649
I am...

252
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,844
...to say goodbye.

253
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,812
Okay, bye-bye.

254
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:27,630
Paolo, I really hate you for what you
did, but I still have five of these...

255
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,768
...so heat it at 375
until the cheese bubbles.

256
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:40,537
I just wanna tell you, and I think
I'd speak for everyone when I say....

257
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,853
Oh, just look at her.

258
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,646
Guys, I think only one of us
should go...

259
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,189
-...so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

260
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,861
And I really think it should be me.

261
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,045
You all right?

262
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:17,915
I've been better.

263
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,116
I don't believe this.

264
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,880
I wasn't supposed to care
about this guy.

265
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,789
It was just supposed to be
this big, fun, ltalian thing.

266
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:35,489
Someday I could look back and say,
"That was a big, fun, ltalian thing. "

267
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,599
It wasn't supposed to feel
like this when it was over.

268
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,202
Come here.

269
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,906
Listen...

270
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,178
...you deserve
so much better than him.

271
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,379
I mean, you...

272
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:02,820
...should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

273
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,622
What?

274
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,263
I' m so sick of guys!

275
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,634
I don't want to look at
or think about another guy.

276
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,970
I don't even want
to be near another guy.

277
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,613
Ross, you' re so great.

278
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,534
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

279
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:47,501
-Medium. Any cookies left?
-Yeah.

280
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,940
See, Rach...

281
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,547
... I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

282
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:01,276
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

283
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,784
I just need to be by myself
for a while.

284
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,483
-I just gotta figure out what I want.
-No, no.

285
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:14,354
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

286
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,500
No, I know. I know.

287
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,832
And l' m sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

288
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,866
-What?
-What?

289
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,773
I' m having a boy?

290
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:30,338
No.

291
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,575
No. In fact, you' re not having a boy.

292
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,950
I' m having a boy.

293
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,152
-Huh? Am I having a boy?
-You' re having a boy!

294
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:43,956
I' m having a boy!

295
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:46,221
-l' m having a boy!
-What is it?

296
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,059
I' m having a boy!
I' m having a boy!

297
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,499
We already knew that!

298
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,539
I' m having a son.

299
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,382
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

300
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,817
Shutout!

301
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:17,887
Where you going? One more game!

302
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,293
-It's 2:30 in the morning.
-Yeah, get out!

303
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,792
You guys always hang out
in my apartment.

304
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,437
I'll only use my left hand.

305
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,663
Come on, wussies!

306
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,742
All right! Okay! I gotta go!

307
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,442
I' m going.

308
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,316
And l' m gone.

309
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,917
-One more game?
-Oh, yeah.

00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,549
-I'm sorry!
-That is it!

2
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,218
You barge in here
and you don't knock?

3
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,948
You have no respect for privacy.
No, you wait!

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,557
-Can I just say one thing?
-What?!

5
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:31,126
That's a relatively open weave.
I can still see...

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,693
...your nippular areas.

7
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,264
The One With The Boobies

8
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:30,117
Honey, tell them the story
about your patient...

9
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,621
...who thinks things are
other things.

10
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,994
When the phone rings
and she takes a shower.

11
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,526
That's pretty much it.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,699
-But you tell it really well, sweetie.
-Thanks. Okay.

13
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,465
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

14
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,442
Okay. I'll miss you.

15
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,137
-lsn't he great?
-He's cute. He likes you so much.

16
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:00,410
I know. He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

17
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,679
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky.

18
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,084
Think you'll do it on his couch?

19
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,090
I don't know. That's a little weird.

20
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,762
It's vinyl.

21
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,365
Okay, you guys want anything else?

22
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,198
-Could I have?
-We're all out. Anybody else?

23
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,703
Did I miss something?

24
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,139
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

25
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,881
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,645
It was an accident. I wasn't
across the street with a telescope.

27
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,585
Can we change the subject, please?

28
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,023
These aren't her "boobies."
These are her breasts.

29
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,666
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

30
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,859
I always liked "Bazoombas."

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,662
Gives them a Latin spin.

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,309
Can we drop this already, please?

33
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,841
Why are you embarrassed?
They were very nice boobies.

34
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,744
"Nice"? They were "nice"?

35
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,749
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice."

36
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,224
Okay. Rock, hard place. Me.

37
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,364
You're so funny!

38
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,400
He's really funny.

39
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,535
I wouldn't wanna be there
when the laughter stops.

40
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,903
Whoa, back up there, sparky.

41
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,879
What did you mean by that?

42
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,411
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...

43
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:42,519
...that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,721
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

45
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,856
Only child, right?

46
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,029
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

47
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,062
-How did you know that?
-It's textbook.

48
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,145
Hey, you guys.
You all know my dad, right?

49
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,337
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days. I got a job.

50
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,744
I'm better off staying with Joey...

51
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,580
...than going back and forth
on the ferry.

52
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,848
-I don't know this one.
-This is my friend Roger.

53
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,821
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

54
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,928
-What happened to the puppet guy?
-Dad.

55
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,858
Oh, excuse me.
So, Ross, how's the wife?

56
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,830
0 for 2, huh?

57
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,733
Chandler, say something funny.

58
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,613
I gotta go. Miss you too.

59
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,857
-I love you, but it's getting late
-Say hi. Hey, Ma.

60
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,755
I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and

61
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,058
Excuse me?

62
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,097
Did you know this isn't Ma?

63
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,545
Her name's Ronni.

64
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,678
She's a pet mortician.

65
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,914
Sure.

66
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,890
So, how long you been...?

67
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,692
Remember when you were a kid,
I'd take you to the navy yard?

68
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,528
-Since then?
-No, it's only been six years.

69
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:41,969
I wanted you to think of a nice memory
so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.

70
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,074
-What are you doing?
-Chopping garlic.

71
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,871
You don't crush it?

72
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,518
You're having an affair,
I chop garlic. It's a wacky world.

73
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,017
Joe, you ever been in love?

74
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,949
-I don't know.
-Then you haven't.

75
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,495
-You're burning tomatoes.
-You're one to talk.

76
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:12,136
Your dad's in love. The worst part is,
it's with two different women.

77
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,397
Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

78
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,669
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

79
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,681
It's like if you woke up
and found out...

80
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,152
...your dad leads this double life.

81
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:36,351
He's like actually some spy
working for the ClA.

82
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,294
That'd be cool.

83
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,531
This blows!

84
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,360
Do you think Dad cheated?

85
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,231
I don't think so.
That would involve sex.

86
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,875
I'd like to think that our parents
don't do that.

87
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,874
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

88
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,144
Why do they have to become people?
Why do they have?

89
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,743
Why...

90
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,257
...can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

91
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,823
What?

92
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,396
What?

93
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,965
Didn't you get a good enough look?

94
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,437
We're all adults here.
There's only one way to resolve this.

95
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,975
Since you saw her boobies you have
to show her your pee-pee.

96
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,184
You know,
I don't see that happening.

97
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,291
Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.

98
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,691
Well, I'm not showing you my tat!

99
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,273
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

100
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,868
Come on up.

101
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,911
Oh, good! Rog is here.

102
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:08,515
-What's the matter with Rog?
-It's a little thing. I hate that guy!

103
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,851
So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

104
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,957
Come on, he's not that bad.

105
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,924
You're wrong! Why would I marry her...

106
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,961
...if I thought that she was
a lesbian?

107
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,270
I don't know. Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

108
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:34,474
Why? Why would l? Why?

109
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,514
I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?

110
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:43,381
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe

111
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,080
Wait! Go back to that "sibling" thing.

112
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,692
Well, I don't know.

113
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,058
You could've sabotaged
your marriage...

114
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,926
...so the sibling would feel like
less of a failure.

115
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,664
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

116
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,140
-You think I'm a failure?
-lsn't he good?

117
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,545
Yeah. No, that's not
what I was saying.

118
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,777
I thought you were on my side.

119
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,683
But maybe you sucked up
to them so they'd favor you.

120
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,622
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

121
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,132
You're right. I mean, you're right.

122
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,236
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but the Weeble Play Palace...

123
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,071
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...

124
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:42,212
...with this lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

125
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,776
And Mom just gave them all away.

126
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,050
That's tough, tough stuff.

127
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,521
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta go.

128
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,457
-Feel better.
-We're gonna be late, sweetie.

129
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,461
-Thanks for everything, Mon.
-No problem.

130
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,061
Listen, it was great seeing you again.

131
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,271
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

132
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,170
Remember, they're just food,
they're not love.

133
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,409
I hate that guy!

134
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,352
Good night, you guys.

135
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,020
Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.

136
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,326
Hey, can we help you?

137
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,895
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

138
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,872
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

139
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,935
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God!

140
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,706
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

141
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,876
I'm Ronni.

142
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,248
Cheese Nip?

143
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,820
Joey's having an embolism,
but I'd go for a nip.

144
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,663
Most people,
when their pets pass on...

145
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,535
...want them like they're sleeping.

146
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,769
Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

147
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,107
Like chasing their tail.

148
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:27,382
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

149
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,954
Joey, if I go first,
I wanna be looking for my keys.

150
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,917
-That's a good one!
-Hey.

151
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,357
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

152
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,656
-Hi.
-Hey.

153
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,461
Hello, babe! What are you doing here?

154
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,537
Oh, you left your hair at my place.

155
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,038
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.

156
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,737
Thank you.

157
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,677
So, who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

158
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,114
Look, I shouldn't have come.

159
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,622
I better go. I'll miss the train.

160
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,992
-I don't want you taking that thing.
-Where do I stay? Here?

161
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,192
We'll go to a hotel.

162
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,537
We'll go to a hotel.

163
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,263
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

164
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,372
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

165
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,409
I want you here so I can
keep an eye on you.

166
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,606
-You're gonna keep an eye on us?
-Right.

167
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,376
As long as you are under my roof...

168
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,987
...you're gonna live by my rules.

169
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,392
That means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

170
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,791
Wow, he's strict.

171
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,064
Dad, you'll be in my room.
You can stay in Chandler's room.

172
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,170
And Chandler will be?

173
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,832
Out here with me, bunking up.

174
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,478
Oh, bunking up. If you smell s'mores,
don't be alarmed.

175
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,170
Thanks. You're a good kid.

176
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,373
I'll show you to my room.

177
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,988
That sounds weird not followed by,
"No, it's late."

178
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:20,155
This is just for tonight.
Tomorrow you gotta change.

179
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,390
Change?

180
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,568
-Break up with Ronni
-I can't!

181
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,930
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!

182
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,733
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

183
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,314
Hey, kickie!

184
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,521
-What are you doing?
-Getting comfortable.

185
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,095
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

186
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,636
I was thinking about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls....

187
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,579
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

188
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,210
You know, how I date all these women.

189
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,581
I always figured, when the right one
comes along...

190
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,760
... I'll be able to go the distance.

191
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,518
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking

192
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,062
You're not him, you're you.

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,868
When they wanted you in
your father's business, did you cave?

194
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,129
-No.
-No.

195
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,740
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

196
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,010
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

197
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,580
I believe when the right woman
comes along...

198
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,685
...you'll have the guts to say,
"No, thanks, I'm married."

199
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,789
-You really think so?
-Yeah, I really do.

200
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,056
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!

201
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,643
-Hi.
-Hi. May I help you?

202
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:19,875
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.

203
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,575
Okay. Who are you?

204
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,148
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

205
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,621
The mistress?

206
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,392
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

207
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,531
I'm Rachel. Bathroom's there.

208
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,167
Ronni, how long has Chandler
been in the shower?

209
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,133
Oh, like five minutes.

210
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,499
Perfect.

211
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:47,874
Fasten your seat belts,
it's pee-pee time.

212
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,282
-Hey, Mr. Trib.
-Hey, good morning, dear.

213
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,082
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

214
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,407
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!

215
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,306
You were supposed to be in there
so I'd see your thing!

216
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,648
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.

217
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,617
-How's it going?
-Good.

218
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,323
Roger's having a dinner thing.
He wanted me to invite you guys.

219
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,334
-So, what's going on?
-Nothing.

220
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,733
It's just....

221
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,035
It's Roger, you know?

222
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,007
There's something about

223
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,272
We just feel that he's....

224
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,039
-We hate that guy!
-We hate him!

225
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,149
-We're sorry, Pheebs.
-Okay.

226
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,881
Don't you think it's just that
he's so perceptive...

227
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,750
...it freaked you out?

228
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,757
No, we hate him!

229
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,122
I'm sorry.

230
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:29,847
-Ma! What are you doing here?
-I came to give you this and this!

231
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,807
Big ring!

232
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,316
Why'd you fill your father's head
with garbage...

233
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,751
...about making things right?

234
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,249
Things were fine this way!

235
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,154
There's chicken in there. Put it away.

236
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,222
For God's sake, Joey! Really.

237
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:53,166
-Hold on. You knew?
-Of course I knew. What do you think?

238
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,431
Your father is no James Bond.

239
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,834
You should've heard his stories.

240
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,534
"I'm sleeping over
at my accountant's."

241
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,842
-What is that? Please!
-So then, how could you?

242
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,712
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

243
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,117
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

244
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:16,090
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

245
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:20,595
Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

246
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,262
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful...

247
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,568
... but what the hell
are you talking about?

248
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,706
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

249
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,746
Look, honey, in an ideal world...

250
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,319
...there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

251
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,016
And something else:

252
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,682
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along...

253
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:53,331
... he's so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

254
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:58,026
He's been more loving. It's like
every day is our anniversary.

255
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,533
-I'm happy for you?
-Well, don't be!

256
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,906
Now everything's screwed up.

257
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,643
I just want it the way it was.

258
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,783
Ma, I'm sorry.

259
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,182
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

260
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,657
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

261
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,657
So tell me. Did you see her?

262
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,463
Yeah.

263
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:36,300
-You're 10 times prettier than she is.
-That's sweet.

264
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,000
Could I take her?

265
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,478
With this ring, no contest.

266
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,119
Oh, no! Don't ever do that!

267
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,523
-What?
-I'm sorry.

268
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,257
I have a thing,
which means you can't ever do that!

269
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,228
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing.

270
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,238
-No, what's wrong? Come on.
-Okay.

271
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:19,550
It's nothing. I'm fine.
It's just It's my friends.

272
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,445
They have a liking problem with you...

273
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,554
...in that they don't.

274
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,286
They don't?

275
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,696
But they don't see all
the wonderfulness that I see.

276
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,426
They don't see all the good
and sweet stuff.

277
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,038
-They think you're a little
-What?

278
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,641
Intense and creepy.

279
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,246
-Oh.
-But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

280
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:58,321
-I'm not at all surprised about that.
-That's why you're so great.

281
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,817
It's quite typical behavior...

282
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:05,256
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

283
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:09,958
You know, this kind of codependent,
emotionally stunted...

284
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:15,502
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...

285
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:19,143
...which might as well
have nipples on them.

286
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:24,806
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me! Define me!

287
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,814
Love me! I need love!

288
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,948
You talked to your dad?

289
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,250
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma
like she wanted.

290
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,155
Ma will keep pretending
she doesn't know.

291
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,058
And my sister, Tina,
can't see her husband.

292
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,324
He got a restraining order.

293
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,762
Which has nothing to do with it.
I found out today.

294
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,272
Things have changed here
on Waltons'mountain.

295
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,736
-So, Joey, are you okay?
-Yeah, I guess.

296
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,347
It's just You know, they're parents.

297
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,383
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

298
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,914
You gotta let them
make their own mistakes.

299
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,692
And think, in a few years,
we'll turn into them.

300
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,192
Oh, please.

301
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:15,730
If I turn into my parents, I'll be
an alcoholic blond chasing men...

302
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,233
...or I'll end up like my mom!

303
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,609
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

304
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,506
How's it going?

305
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,546
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

306
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,346
-Yeah, right.
-No, no, really.

307
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,353
-What happened?
-I don't know. I mean...

308
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,189
... he's a good person,
and he can be really sweet.

309
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,732
In some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

310
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,368
It's just.... I hate that guy!

311
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,738
Hi, Joey. What's going on?

312
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,609
Clear the tracks
for the boobie payback.

313
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,114
Next stop, Rachel Greene.

314
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,154
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

315
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,125
Sorry, wrong boobies!

316
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,469
Hello, Joey!

317
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,206
Hello, dear!

1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:04,394
Ross, she wants you.

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,164
We just live in the same building.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,006
-Any contact?
-She lent me an egg.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:13,976
-You're in!
-Right.

5
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,079
Hey, Ross.

6
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,886
Come on. Get back in the game.

7
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:29,791
The Rachel thing isn't happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian....

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,258
I don't think we need a third.

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,525
Could we get an egg,
still in the shell?

10
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,824
An egg?

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,906
Go up to her and say,
"I'm returning your egg."

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,842
I think it's winning.

13
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,174
-It's insane.
-She'll love it.

14
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:52,642
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

15
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,546
Go with the egg, my friend.

16
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,191
Go, go, go!

17
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,461
-Think it'll work?
-No way. It's suicide.

18
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,258
The One With The Candy Hearts

19
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,811
-You can't do this.
-Do what?

20
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:03,888
-Roger wants to take her out.
-No! Remember why you dumped him?

21
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,857
Because he was creepy.

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,994
And mean. And frightening.

23
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:13,599
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day!

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,860
You can go out with a creep any night.

25
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,334
I know I do.

26
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,475
-What are you doing tomorrow night?
-That depends on how tonight goes.

27
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,808
-About tonight
-Don't you bail on me!

28
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,612
I said I'd bring a friend
for her friend.

29
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:39,019
-But her friend sounds like a
-Pathetic mess. I know, but....

30
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,321
Come on. She's needy, vulnerable.

31
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,259
I'm thinking....

32
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,765
Thanks.

33
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:55,397
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

34
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:02,405
-She said yes.
-Way to go, man!

35
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,180
Still got the egg, huh?

36
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,423
How do I look?

37
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,324
I don't care.

38
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,332
There's Lorraine.

39
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,909
No trading. You get the pretty one,
I get the mess.

40
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,278
Hi, Joey.

41
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,080
Well, well!
Look what you brought!

42
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,750
Very nice.

43
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,255
And what did you bring?

44
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,424
She's checking her coat.

45
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,995
I'm gonna wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

46
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:56,532
Get me a white zinfandel,
and a glass of red for Janice.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,104
Janice?

48
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,141
Janice!?

49
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,739
Oh...

50
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,346
... my...

51
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,278
...God!

52
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,621
Hey, it's Janice!

53
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,654
Okay, I'm making a break for it!

54
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:30,496
I've been waiting for, like, forever
to go out with Lorraine.

55
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,933
-Just calm down.
-Calm down?

56
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,576
You set me up with a woman I've
dumped twice in the last five months!

57
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,675
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous and....

58
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,879
I can't go when I'm nervous.

59
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,681
I'm sorry, you're right.

60
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,119
Come on! Do it, do it!

61
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,865
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing
compared to Pete.

62
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,060
-Who?
-Pete the Weeper.

63
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:09,105
The guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

64
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,938
"Was it good for you?"

65
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:18,279
I'd take crying any day
over Howard, the "I win" guy!

66
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,419
"I win! I win!"

67
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,789
We went out for two months.
I didn't win once.

68
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,450
How do we end up with these jerks?

69
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,495
We're some kind of magnets.

70
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,635
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

71
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,866
There's more beer, right?

72
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,972
You know my friend who shaves her head?

73
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,502
No.

74
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,878
I have this friend
who shaves her head.

75
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,020
She says to break the
bad boyfriend cycle...

76
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,349
...you can do a cleansing ritual.

77
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,654
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

78
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,788
Yeah.

79
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,793
We can do it tomorrow night.

80
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,264
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

81
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,702
Okay, what kind of ritual?

82
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:19,368
We can burn the stuff they gave us.

83
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,313
Or...?

84
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:27,577
Or we can chant and dance
around naked with sticks.

85
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,624
Burning's good.

86
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,759
You know...

87
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:47,429
... I can pick up quarters with my toes.

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,371
Yeah?
Good for you.

89
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,340
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

90
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,813
By the way, I cut you out of
all of my pictures.

91
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:10,894
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

92
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,826
That's okay.

93
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:16,895
You could make little puppets
out of them.

94
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:21,665
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty!

95
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:28,143
-We can't do that!
-What? What can't you do?

96
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,978
Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

97
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,755
We might be leaving now.

98
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,955
Tell me it's you and me "we."

99
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:51,193
She wants to slather my body
with stuff and lick it off.

100
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,430
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

101
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,076
But I definitely want
to be a part of it!

102
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,375
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

103
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,080
You're right. I'm sorry.

104
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:09,984
Can we have three
chocolate mousses to go?

105
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,950
I'm out of here.

106
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,254
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me.

107
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,261
I hope she throws up on you.

108
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,035
Thanks.

109
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,302
-So....
-Just us.

110
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,972
What a crappy night!

111
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,835
I have enjoyed the fact...

112
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,483
...that your shirt's been
sticking out of your zipper.

113
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,247
Excuse me.

114
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,422
How you doing?

115
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,495
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

116
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,835
Joey's not a friend.
He's...

117
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,502
...a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

118
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,514
Another drink? Dessert?
A big-screen TV?

119
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,778
-I'll have a drink.
-Got it. Good woman!

120
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,024
-A bottle of overpriced champagne.
-Each.

121
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:28,030
That's right, each.
And a rob roy.

122
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,134
I've always wanted to know.

123
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,683
Happy Valentine's Day!

124
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,701
Oh, I miss you already.

125
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,929
-Can you believe this happened?
-No, no!

126
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,007
And yet it did.

127
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,270
-Goodbye, Janice.
-kiss me!

128
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,478
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

129
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,018
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

130
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,519
-Hey, Janice.
-Hi, Monica.

131
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,752
Well, this was very special.

132
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,022
Rach, come see who's out here!

133
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,191
What's going on? Oh, my God!

134
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,802
Janice! Hi!

135
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,873
Janice is gonna go away now!

136
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,635
I'll be right back.

137
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,009
Joey! Look who it is!

138
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,644
Good. Joey's home.

139
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,254
This is so much fun!

140
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,291
This is like a reunion in the hall!

141
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,724
Ross, there's someone
I want you to say hi to.

142
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,500
He happened to call.

143
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,504
Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me!
How did you know?

144
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,486
So, if dogs experience jet lag...

145
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:38,026
... because of the seven dog years
to one human year thing...

146
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,563
...when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles...

147
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:46,737
... he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses a week and a half.

148
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,333
That's funny!

149
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,451
They should be cooking the food soon.

150
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,145
Oh, good.

151
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,531
Who are they?

152
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,196
The blond is my ex-wife.
The woman touching her is her...

153
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,701
...close, personal friend.

154
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:31,343
-They're lovers?
-lf you want to put a label on it.

155
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:37,452
-Anything else I should know?
-Nope. That's it.

156
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,856
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

157
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,424
I always forget that part.

158
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,125
Hello!

159
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:02,272
Now we need sage branches
and the sacramental wine.

160
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,479
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

161
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,983
That's okay!

162
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:17,593
Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

163
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,762
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing
the ritual in the first place.

164
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:32,535
-Can we start throwing things in?
-Yeah, okay!

165
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,977
Okay.
Barry's letters.

166
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,846
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

167
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,322
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with....

168
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,688
-A picture of Scotty Jared naked!
-Let me see!

169
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,265
-He's wearing a sweater.
-No.

170
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,109
-Whose MCl card is that?
-Mine. Shoot!

171
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,009
Remember this number:
Nine, seven, four....

172
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,215
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

173
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,048
Wait, isn't it almost pure

174
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,060
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

175
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,893
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

176
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,770
In my next life,
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

177
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,541
Hello, funny valentine!

178
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,235
Hi, just Janice.

179
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,382
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

180
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,849
I could just kiss you all over,
and I'm gonna.

181
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,727
If you don't do it, I will.

182
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:21,010
-So are you actually from New York?
-Not originally. I'm from

183
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:25,282
-You said they'd shoot it without you.
-I thought they could.

184
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:31,430
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake.
Mini-pads should be that much easier.

185
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,556
-It's Valentine's Day.
-I know, but it's my job.

186
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,897
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can.

187
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,265
I'm spending most of my time
teaching science...

188
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:47,241
...which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

189
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,450
Now, that is funny!

190
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:09,032
Do you think it would be too weird
if I invited Carol over to join us?

191
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:14,764
Because she's alone now.
And pregnant. And sad.

192
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,933
-I guess.
-Are you sure? Carol!

193
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,944
-Wanna join us?
-No, I'm fine.

194
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,446
Come on.
These people will scooch down.

195
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:31,956
You guys will scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching! Come on!

196
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,285
-Come on.
-Thank you.

197
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:40,726
IKristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.
Carol, Kristen.

198
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,732
-How do you do?
-Carol teaches sixth grade.

199
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,605
And Kristen....

200
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,076
IKristen does something...

201
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,810
...that, funnily enough...

202
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,778
...wasn't even her major!

203
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:08,216
-Thanks for coming over.
-Not at all. It's pretty much our job.

204
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,191
That's why we get the cool hats.

205
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,834
-What do we got there?
-A piece of sik boxer shorts.

206
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,367
Some greeting cards.

207
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,831
A half-charred picture of....

208
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,204
That guy's hairier than the chief!

209
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:32,015
It's a really funny story
how this happened.

210
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:37,553
I was taking out the trash,
and Phoebe was burning incense

211
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,088
It's all right.

212
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:44,354
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of control.

213
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,430
-Third one tonight.
-Really?

214
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,797
Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

215
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:57,139
Next time you're burning
your ex-boyfriend's stuff:

216
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,243
One, do it in a well-ventilated area.

217
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:05,611
Two, if you wanna burn his clothing,
stay away from synthetic fabrics.

218
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:11,484
Three, try to let go of the anger,
and learn to love yourself.

219
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,494
-I brought you something.
-ls it loaded?

220
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:26,895
Oh, little candy hearts.
"Chan and Jan Forever."

221
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,371
I had them made special.

222
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,243
Okay, Janice.

223
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,146
Hey, Janice.

224
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,220
There's no way to tell you this.

225
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,881
At least, there's no new way.

226
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:55,159
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

227
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,130
That's fine.

228
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,471
It is?

229
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:08,635
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

230
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,739
You see, actually, it is.

231
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,750
No, because you won't let that happen.

232
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,784
Don't you know it yet?

233
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:21,392
You love me, Chandler Bing!

234
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,189
Oh, no, I don't.

235
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:31,359
Why do we keep ending up together?
New Year's, who invited who?

236
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,597
-Valentine's, who asked who into bed?
-I did, but

237
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,401
You seek me out!

238
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:42,571
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn!

239
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,581
Janice! Janice!

240
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,913
You push me away,
you pull me back!

241
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,883
You want me. You need me.

242
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:58,995
You can't live without me.
And you know it.

243
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:04,836
You just don't know you know it.

244
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,034
See?

245
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,409
Call me!

246
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,618
It's not true.
I never called your mother a wolverine.

247
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,160
You did so, I swear to

248
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,363
How long has she been in the bathroom?

249
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,802
She isn't in the bathroom.
Her coat's gone.

250
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,638
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

251
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,676
I screwed up my first date
in nine years.

252
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,545
-That could be it.
-Oh, God.

253
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:58,622
You know, this is still pretty hot.

254
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,091
Mushroom.

255
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,455
Smile.

256
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:11,193
They won't all be like this.
Some might stay through dinner.

257
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,600
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-It's just....

258
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,367
You know the whole
"get on with your life" thing?

259
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,875
Well, do I have to?

260
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:25,914
I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

261
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,245
...and she's perfectly nice, but that...

262
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,591
...that's it.

263
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,729
Then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

264
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,431
And I don't have to....

265
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,324
-I know.
-You know?

266
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,667
Here's a wacky thought.

267
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,573
Let's say you and I give it
another shot.

268
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,273
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

269
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:04,254
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now.

270
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,118
Let's just stick a pin in it.

271
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:13,231
Because we're great together.
You can't deny it.

272
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:17,534
I've got a ring at home
that fits you.

273
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:22,571
I've got lots of pictures
with both of us in them.

274
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,972
And best of all,
you're carrying my baby.

275
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,875
-I mean, how perfect is that?
-Ross

276
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:35,714
You keep saying that, but there's
something right here. I love you.

277
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,462
I love you too.

278
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,331
-But
-No "but."

279
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:54,596
You know that thing we
put over here with the pin in it?

280
00:22:55,741 --> 00:23:00,075
It's time to take the pin out.

281
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,752
You'll find someone.
The right woman is waiting for you.

282
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,480
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

283
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,455
All you need is a woman who likes men,
and you'll be set.

284
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,401
Not her.

285
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:39,443
So, you guys really slide down a pole?

286
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,947
-Absolutely.
-That's so cool.

287
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,150
How do you get back up?

288
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:55,692
Well, we rarely have to return
from a fire as quickly.

289
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,365
So, would you guys....

290
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:06,442
Would you like to, sometime, maybe....

291
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,613
Go for a drink sometime?

292
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,179
Sure, sounds good.

293
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:13,715
We get off at midnight.
We'll pick you up then.

294
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,580
Okay. Great!

295
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,286
So will you bring the truck?

296
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,220
I'll even let you ring the bell.

297
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,229
-We'll see you later.
-Bye! See you later!

298
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,731
Oh, my God!

299
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,634
See? There you go.
The cleansing worked.

300
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,900
You're right. They're nice guys!

301
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,944
They're firemen guys!

302
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:46,482
-Tell them you're married?
-No. My girlfriend doesn't even know.

Coffee.

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:06,299
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,632
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,538
Thank you.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,709
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

6
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,286
That's why.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,721
Sorry.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,354
The One With The Stoned Guy

9
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,845
Chandler?

10
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,315
Miss Tedlock, you look lovely today.

11
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:30,080
That is a very flattering
sleeve length on you.

12
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:36,154
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office today.

13
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,696
If it's about those prank memos,
I wasn't involved.

14
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,834
Nothing at all. Really.

15
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,967
And frankly, those shenanigans have
no place in an office environment.

16
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,517
Hey, you guys!

17
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,585
Chandler's coming and
he has incredible news.

18
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:05,291
So when he gets here,
let's all act, like, you know

19
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,789
Never mind. But it was gonna
be really good.

20
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,161
What's going on?

21
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,093
So it's a typical day at work...

22
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:19,271
...and Big Al tells me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

23
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,631
-That is great!
-Congratulations!

24
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,070
So I quit.

25
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,942
Why?

26
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,273
Why? This was a temp job.

27
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,379
Chandler, you've been there
for five years.

28
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,816
I know, but if I took it, I'd be
admitting that this is what I do.

29
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:41,085
Does that mean we have to start buying
our own toilet paper?

30
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,752
That was Joey Tribbiani
with the big picture. Dan?

31
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,763
Was it more money?

32
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:51,528
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office...

33
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,729
...worrying about the WENUS.

34
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,570
The "WENUS"?

35
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,674
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

36
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,313
Oh, that WENUS.

37
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,113
What will you do?

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,654
I don't know. But I won't
figure it out working there.

39
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,086
I have something you can do!

40
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,626
I have this new massage client, Steve.

41
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,927
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant...

42
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,602
...and he's looking for a head chef.

43
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,205
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

44
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,901
I know. You're a chef
and I thought of you first.

45
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,774
But Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so....

46
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,310
I just don't have a lot
of chef-ing experience.

47
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,615
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

48
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,457
What is he looking for?

49
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,890
He wants to do something eclectic.

50
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:54,658
He's looking for someone
who can create the entire menu.

51
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,697
So, what do you think?

52
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,671
Thanks. I just don't see myself
in a big, white hat.

53
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,472
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

54
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,775
a perfect run-up
and there he goes, a perfect....

55
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,682
Watch stuff like this...

56
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:19,346
...and you realize
why evolution is just a theory.

57
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:28,392
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

58
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,970
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

59
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:34,639
Where are you going?

60
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:40,837
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

61
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,641
-I added the "a-go-go."
-Career counselor?

62
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,784
You guys all know
what you want to do.

63
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,318
I don't.

64
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,584
You guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

65
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,591
You have goals. You have dreams.
I don't have a dream!

66
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,198
The lesser-known
"I Don't Have a Dream" speech.

67
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,698
I love my life! I love my life!

68
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,633
"Brian's Song"!

69
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,274
-The meeting went great?
-So great!

70
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,573
He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

71
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:20,082
It's not too big or too small.
It's just right.

72
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,289
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

73
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,891
I'm cooking for him Monday,
kind of an audition.

74
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,825
Phoebe, he wants you here.
It's great. You can make yummy noises.

75
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,331
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

76
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:42,306
-And Monica, what are you gonna make?
-I don't know. It's gotta be great.

77
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,772
I know what you can make!
I know!

78
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:49,037
You should make that thing
with the stuff.

79
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,415
You know that thing with the stuff?

80
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,612
Okay, I don't know.

81
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,887
Anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

82
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:05,463
How about Tony's? If you finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

83
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,831
Anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

84
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,670
-Who are you going out with?
-ls this the bug lady?

85
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,471
"I love you, Ross."

86
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:26,082
Her name is Celia and
she's insect curator at the museum.

87
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,316
-What are you gonna do?
-Go out to dinner...

88
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:36,018
...then bring her back to my place
and introduce her to my monkey.

89
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,093
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

90
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:48,567
So back to your place?
You thinking maybe....

91
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,671
Well, I don't know....

92
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,245
I'm hoping....

93
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,210
That monkey is a chick magnet.

94
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:04,219
She'll take one look at his cute,
little face and it'll seal the deal.

95
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:09,094
Celia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

96
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,320
Soothing tones.

97
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,067
-Here, Marcel.
-I can't stand this.

98
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,171
-He's got his claws on my
-Yeah, all right.

99
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,011
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

100
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,915
Good.

101
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,111
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

102
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:40,156
-It's creamier.
-Yeah? Well, is that better?

103
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,386
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish.

104
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,425
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

105
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,801
God, what happened to you?

106
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,976
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests...

107
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,477
...intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?

108
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:09,019
"You're suited for data processing for
a large multinational corporation."

109
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,623
That's so great!
You already know how to do that.

110
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,989
Can you believe it?

111
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,664
Don't I seem like I should
be doing something cool?

112
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:22,833
I just always pictured myself
doing something....

113
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,296
Something!

114
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,539
Chandler, I know, I know.

115
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,440
Hey, you can see your nipples
through this shirt.

116
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,811
Maybe this will cheer you up.

117
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:44,156
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better split this with you.

118
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,656
It's supposed to be small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

119
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,988
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

120
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,693
Well, it is amusing.

121
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,970
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00.

122
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,643
What did we say, $10 an hour?

123
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,411
Okay, great.
All right, I'll see you then.

124
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,886
-$10 an hour for what?
-A waitress from work is helping me.

125
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,186
Waitressing?

126
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,593
Of course I thought of you.
But....

127
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,792
-But....
-But, but....

128
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:37,237
But it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know?

129
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,639
Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

130
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:50,012
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the Olympics.

131
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:57,620
I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at lnnsbruck in '76.

132
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,629
Took home a bronze.

133
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,597
Amuse-bouche?

134
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,616
Talk to me.

135
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,792
A weird thing happened
on the train this morning

136
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,963
Talk dirty.

137
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,234
-Here?
-Come on. Come on.

138
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,037
Say something hot.

139
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,579
What? What?

140
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,257
Vulva.

141
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,571
Vulva?

142
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:19,105
I panicked, all right?
She took me by surprise.

143
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,213
But it wasn't a total loss.
We ended up cuddling.

144
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,976
You cuddled? How many times?

145
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,914
Shut up. It was nice.

146
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,182
I don't think
I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.

147
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:38,125
Just say what you wanna do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.

148
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,697
Or what other people
might be doing to each other.

149
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,132
I'll tell you what.
Try something on me.

150
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,268
Please be kidding.

151
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,904
Why not?

152
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:58,548
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

153
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,956
I'm in my apartment....

154
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,926
-Yeah, what else?
-You're not there.

155
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:16,125
-We're not having this conversation.
-All right, I'll start. Ready?

156
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,963
Oh, Ross...

157
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,273
...you get me so hot.
I want your lips on me now.

158
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,076
-Now you say something.
-I really don't think so.

159
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:37,947
You like this woman, right?
You wanna see her again, right?

160
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:42,491
If you can't talk dirty to me,
how will you talk dirty to her?

161
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,255
Now tell me
you wanna caress my butt!

162
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,402
Okay, turn around.

163
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,305
I don't want you staring at me.

164
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,202
All right, I'm not looking.
Go ahead.

165
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,104
Okay.

166
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:05,245
I want
Okay, I want...

167
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:10,047
...to feel your hot, soft skin
with my lips.

168
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:15,250
There you go.
IKeep going, keep going.

169
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,593
I want to take my tongue and

170
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,268
Say it.

171
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,073
Say it!

172
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,477
run it all over your body...

173
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,081
... until you're trembling with

174
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,135
With?

175
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,543
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna believe this.

176
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,949
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

177
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,352
-The trembling thing was nice.
-Shut up!

178
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,621
That guy from your old job
called again.

179
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:30,098
-Again?
-And again and again and again.

180
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,937
And again.

181
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:41,876
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 1 5th floor?

182
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,975
Yeah, I miss you too.

183
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:48,552
It's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.

184
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,248
That's very generous.
But this isn't about the money.

185
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,988
I need more than a job.
I need something I really care ab

186
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,390
That's on top of the year-end bonus?

187
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,932
Your dream!

188
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,604
Look, Al, I'm not
playing hardball here, okay?

189
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,765
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

190
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,568
Stop saying numbers!

191
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,181
I'm telling you,
you've got the wrong guy!

192
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,977
I'll see you Monday!

193
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:39,437
Wow! It's huge!
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

194
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,797
This is a cube!

195
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,333
Look at this.

196
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,314
You have a window!

197
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,712
Yes, indeed-y.
With a beautiful view of

198
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,854
Look! That guy's peeing!

199
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,021
That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

200
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,592
Okay, sit down here.

201
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,128
This is great.

202
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,724
-You ready?
-Yeah.

203
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,463
Helen, could you come in here?

204
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,442
Thank you, Helen. That'll be all.

205
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,040
Last time I do that.
I promise.

206
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:33,090
-She doesn't seem very warm.
-I know. She has no personality.

207
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,921
Wendy, don't do this to me.

208
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:44,694
We had a deal.
Yeah, you promised.

209
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:56,042
-Who was that?
-Wendy bailed.

210
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,112
I have no waitress.

211
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:04,221
That's too bad.
Bye-bye.

212
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,051
Ten dollars an hour!
Twelve dollars an hour!

213
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,897
I wish I could, but I've made plans
to walk around.

214
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,226
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there.

215
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:20,404
I put a roof over your head!
If that means nothing....

216
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,540
Twenty dollars an hour.

217
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,799
Done.

218
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,347
Hello. Welcome to Monica's.
May I take your coat?

219
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,426
-Hi, Steve.
-Hello, Monica.

220
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,925
Hello, greeter girl.

221
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,490
-This is Rachel.
-Yeah, okay.

222
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,128
Everything smells so delicious.

223
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,636
I can't remember ever smelling
such a delicious combination of

224
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,103
Okay, smells.

225
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:03,104
-It's a lovely apartment.
-Thank you. Would you like a tour?

226
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,478
I was just being polite,
but all right.

227
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,052
-What's up?
-ln the cab on the way over...

228
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,657
...Steve blazed up a doobie.

229
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,392
What?

230
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,999
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja

231
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,402
I'm with you, Cheech.

232
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:32,000
-Do you think he's gonna be cool?
-ls it dry in here?

233
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,739
Let me get you some wine.

234
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,449
I think we're ready
for our first course too.

235
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:47,385
These are rock shrimp ravioli
in a cilantro ponzu sauce...

236
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,355
...with just a touch of minced...

237
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,065
...ginger.

238
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,705
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

239
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,772
-These are fantastic!
-Gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

240
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,504
Like them? I could eat 100 of them!

241
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,745
That's all there is of these...

242
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,320
...but in a few minutes,
we'll serve some tartlets.

243
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,553
"Tartlets"?

244
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,523
"Tartlets."

245
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,128
"Tartlets."

246
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,733
Word has lost all meaning.

247
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,042
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?

248
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,975
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

249
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,361
Cool! Taco shells!

250
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,834
They're like a little
corn envelope, you know?

251
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,907
-You don't wanna spoil your appetite.
-Hey, Sugar-O's!

252
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,577
You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes

253
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:18,408
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

254
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,380
-No, we don't.
-Oh, okay.

255
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,853
Sorry.

256
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,562
Why don't you just have a seat here?

257
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,773
-Give me the gummy bears.
-No.

258
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,838
-Give them to me.
-We'll share.

259
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,539
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.

260
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,912
It's not worth it!

261
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,987
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

262
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,289
Don't just stand there.
Call 9-1 -1.

263
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,987
Hey, fellas, grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourselves!

264
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:12,169
Help! Help, I'm drowning!

265
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,231
-That's it! Dinner is over!
-What! Why?

266
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:21,140
Why? What if I came into your office
and I started...?

267
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,376
I can't think of an example.

268
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,040
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this...

269
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,881
...and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes
for a tartlet?

270
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,433
So I told him,
"I'm sorry. That's how I feel."

271
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,434
And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.

272
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:51,302
Then I said, "Don't eat that.
It's a kitchen magnet."

273
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:57,446
And he didn't listen,
so we left him in the emergency room.

274
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:02,050
-Mon, I'm sorry.
-What a tool.

275
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:07,315
-You did the right thing.
-You don't wanna work for that guy.

276
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,324
I just thought that this was it.

277
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:16,625
-Don't worry. You're an amazing chef.
-Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

278
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,270
Am I gonna get paid
for the full three hours?

279
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:24,033
Just a question.
We'll talk about it later.

280
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,374
So, how did it go with Celia?

281
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:36,047
-I was unbelievable.
-All right, Ross!

282
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,916
I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.

283
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,854
It was the most elaborate filth
ever heard.

284
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,327
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines, themes, a motif.

285
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,295
At one point, there were villagers.

286
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,399
And?

287
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:58,170
By the time we finished
all the dirty talk...

288
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,901
...it was late
and we were exhausted

289
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,809
-You cuddled.
-Yeah, which was nice.

290
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,913
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie?

291
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,817
-Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
-Where the hell is he?

292
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,190
I know what time it is...

293
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,122
...but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

294
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,731
Let me tell you something.

295
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:26,165
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

296
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,782
How's this?

297
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,286
Sorry. How about over here?

298
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,287
That means it's working.

299
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,618
-Does this hurt?
-No.

300
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,087
How about this?

301
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,897
There you go!

302
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,699
I'm gonna throw up!

00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,371
Unbelievable!
It's been half an hour.

2
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:13,068
If this was a cartoon,
you'd look like a ham now.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,046
-There's the waitress. Hello, miss!
-It's Phoebe!

4
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:25,690
-Okay, will that be all?
-Wait. What are you doing here?

5
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:30,056
I was over there. Then you said,
"Hello, miss." So I'm here.

6
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,063
No, how come you're working here?

7
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:37,430
Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are cute.

8
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,865
-Can we start over?
-Okay, I'm gonna be over here.

00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,941
The One With Two Parts - Part l

10
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,126
I don't know whether
he's testing me...

11
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:38,058
... but my monkey is out of control!

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,064
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

13
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,032
Supposedly by accident.

14
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,105
Oh, yeah, I've done that.

15
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,577
And then he got to
the newspaper before I did...

16
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,647
...and peed all over the crossword!

17
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,647
I've never done that.

18
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:04,689
Last night, I don't know what he did
but there were capers everywhere!

19
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:11,721
-She looks exactly like her sister.
-I'm saying I see a difference.

20
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,262
They're twins.

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,129
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot!

22
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,538
You know how we talk about things?

23
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,437
-Let's not do that anymore.
-All right.

24
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,948
-Pheebs, guess who we saw today?
-Oh, fun! Okay.

25
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,584
-Liam Neeson.
-No.

26
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,184
-Morley Safer.
-No.

27
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:38,414
-The lady who cuts my hair!
-This could be a very long game.

28
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,685
-Your sister, Ursula.
-Oh, really?

29
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,887
-She works at that place....
-Riff's. I know.

30
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:49,330
You do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

31
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,601
So, is she fat?

32
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,834
Not from where I was standing.

33
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,411
Where were you standing?

34
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,614
Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,545
It's mostly just dumb sister stuff.

36
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:13,157
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

37
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:20,891
She was the first to walk even
though I did it later that same day.

38
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:25,764
But to my parents, by then it was,
"Yeah, what else is new?"

39
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,975
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

40
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,873
And I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

41
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,647
-ls this just gonna be you and Carol?
-Susan will be there too.

42
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:45,620
We've got dads, we've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

43
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,693
-lsn't that gonna be weird?
-lt might have been at first...

44
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,694
... but now I'm comfortable with it.

45
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,732
-Ross, that's my jacket.
-I know.

46
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:08,476
Hi. We're the Rostens.
I'm J. C. and he's Michael.

47
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,581
And we're having a boy and a girl.

48
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,276
Good for you.
All right, next?

49
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,956
I'm Ross Geller.
And that's my boy in there.

50
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:28,462
And this is Carol Willick.
And this is Susan Bunch.

51
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,727
Susan is Carol's....

52
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,841
Who's next?

53
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,246
Sorry, Susan is...?

54
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,575
-Carol's friend.
-Life partner.

55
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,752
Like buddies.

56
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,950
-Like lovers.
-You know how close women can get.

57
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,718
-We live together.
-I was married to her.

58
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,589
-Carol, not me.
-It's a bit complicated.

59
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,390
-But we're fine.
-Absolutely!

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,260
So, twins!
That's like two births.

61
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,504
Ouch!

62
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,409
to you too, Helen.

63
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,052
-Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
-Okay, send her in.

64
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,554
-Come on in.
-You wanted to see me?

65
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:36,258
I was reviewing your data. You've
been postdating your Friday numbers.

66
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:41,736
-Which is bad, because...?
-lt throws my WENUS out of whack.

67
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,671
-Excuse me?
-WENUS.

68
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,744
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.

69
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,209
Gotcha!

70
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:54,682
Won't happen again. I wouldn't want
to do anything to hurt your WENUS.

71
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,719
I'll take "ldiots in the Workplace"
for 200, Alex.

72
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,991
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that...

73
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,761
...she's really, really cute.

74
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,464
It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

75
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,967
God, I even know that
and I'm pretty much unemployable.

76
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,915
Ross, your little creature's got
the remote again.

77
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,248
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

78
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,387
Marcel!

79
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,589
Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now!

80
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,300
You give Rossy the remote

81
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,993
-Great.
-Relax. I'll fix it.

82
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,505
Oh, cool!
Urkel in Spanish is Urkel.

83
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,177
How did he do this?

84
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:02,477
Is leaving Christmas lights up your
plan to keep us merry all year long?

85
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:08,092
No, someone was supposed to take them
down but obviously someone forgot.

86
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:12,421
Someone was supposed to write,
"Rach, take down the lights"...

87
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,624
...and put it on the refrigera

88
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,502
-How long has that been there?
-A really long time.

89
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,137
-Where you been?
-Riff's.

90
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,074
I think Ursula likes me.
I ordered coffee.

91
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,274
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

92
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,851
Score.

93
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,280
She is so hot!

94
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:44,691
Before you do anything Joey-like,
you might want to run it by....

95
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,726
-Pheebs?
-Yeah.

96
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,496
Is it okay
if I asked out your sister?

97
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,902
Why? Why would you want
to do that? Why?

98
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,170
So if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

99
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,444
Well, I'm not my sister's,
you know, whatever.

100
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,523
And I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

101
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:18,186
But you know,
we've grown apart so....

102
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,393
I don't know. Why not?

103
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,825
Cool. Thanks.

104
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,663
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

105
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,243
Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?

106
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,018
Sorry.

107
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,498
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Where's Carol?

108
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,928
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

109
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,831
You can go.
I'll get the information.

110
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:04,338
No, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

111
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,308
Oh, good. This will be fun.

112
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:12,109
We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

113
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,047
Moms, get on your back.

114
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:18,485
And coaches, you should
be supporting Mommy's head.

115
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,157
-What?
-What?

116
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:32,201
-I'm supposed to be the mommy?
-I'll play my sperm card once more.

117
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,468
I have to miss the coaching training
because I'm a woman?

118
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,805
-So, what do we do?
-I'll flip you for it.

119
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:44,107
Flip me for it? No, no.
Heads!

120
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,013
On your back, Mom!

121
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:54,986
All right, mommies, take a nice
deep, cleansing breath.

122
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,919
Good.

123
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:04,763
Now imagine your vagina is opening
like a flower.

124
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,610
-Mr. D! How's it going, sir?
-It's been better.

125
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,681
The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

126
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,481
-And?
-It's pretty ugly.

127
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,387
We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the '70s.

128
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,991
-What does this mean?
-We'll be laying off people.

129
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,165
I know I was late last week.
But I slept funny and

130
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,669
Not you. Relax.

131
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,338
Ever have to fire anyone?

132
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:49,003
No, but that's not a problem.
That's why my name's on the door.

133
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:52,874
Do you know when I'm getting
my name on the door?

134
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,849
I don't know.
I put it in the thing.

135
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,691
It's okay.
So, who is it gonna be?

136
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,649
Nina!

137
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,785
Nina.

138
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,822
Nina.

139
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,469
Are you okay?

140
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,968
Yes. Yes, I am.

141
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,146
Listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was....

142
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,680
Please don't hate me.

143
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,442
What?

144
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,186
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

145
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,856
So, what do you want
for your birthday?

146
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,600
What I want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

147
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:51,202
Okay. Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

148
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,574
-Bath salts would be nice!
-Okay! Good.

149
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,080
What is this place?

150
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:10,227
You're cold, I have to pee and
there's coffee. How bad could it be?

151
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,954
I think we have an answer.

152
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,366
Why is she here?

153
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,231
This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

154
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,305
-Think Riff's fired her?
-No, we were there last night.

155
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,307
Are you gonna go to the...?

156
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:31,347
-I'll wait till we order. It's her.
-lt looks like her.

157
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,984
-Excuse me?
-Yeah.

158
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,154
Hi, it's us!

159
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,024
Right. And it's me!

160
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,159
-So you're here too?
-As much as you are.

161
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,061
Your turn.

162
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,001
-We know what we want.
-That's good.

163
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,004
-Two caffe lattes.
-And some biscotti.

164
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,140
Good choice.

165
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,373
-It's definitely her.
-Yeah.

166
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:17,593
I can't believe you haven't told
that girl she doesn't have a job.

167
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,032
You haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

168
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,769
Congratulations! You've found
the world's thinnest argument.

169
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,604
I'm finding the right moment.

170
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,209
That shouldn't be so hard
now that you're dating.

171
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:37,440
"Honey, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?"

172
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,723
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

173
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,460
I'll get it.

174
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,867
-Hi, Mr. Heckles.
-You're doing it again.

175
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:02,901
We're not doing anything.
We're sitting and talking quietly.

176
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,803
I can hear you through the ceiling.

177
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,546
My cats can't sleep.

178
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,751
-You don't even have cats.
-I could have cats.

179
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:20,622
-Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
-We'll try to keep it down.

180
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,433
Phoebe, do me a favor. Try this on.
I want to make sure it fits.

181
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,594
My first birthday present!
This is really

182
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:38,539
No, no, it's for Ursula.
I just figured size-wise....

183
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,938
Sure. Yeah. Okay, it fits.

184
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,948
-Are you seeing her again?
-Yep, lce Capades.

185
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:54,217
This is serious. I've never known you
to pay for any kind of "capade."

186
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,928
I don't know. I like her.

187
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,463
She's different.
There's something about her

188
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,103
That you like.
We get it. You like her. Great!

189
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,568
Phoebe, I asked you.
You said it was okay.

190
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,742
Maybe now it's not okay.

191
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,572
Okay. Maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

192
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,248
Okay!

193
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,954
IKnit, good woman, knit!

194
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,367
And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.

195
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,937
-Nina!
-Mr. Douglas. Cool tie.

196
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,447
She's still here.

197
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,076
Yes. Yes, she is.
Didn't I memo you on this?

198
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:59,189
After I let her go, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flennan

199
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,155
Dr. Flennan
Dr. Flynn.

200
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:06,457
And he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

201
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,532
In fact, he mentioned
the word "frenzy."

202
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,635
-You're kidding! She seems so
-No. Nina? She's

203
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,472
If you asked her now...

204
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:22,136
...she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

205
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,545
-That's unbelievable.
-And yet believable.

206
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:31,887
So I decided not to fire her again
until she'll be no threat to anyone.

207
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:37,053
I guess you never know what's
going on inside a person's head.

208
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,455
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

209
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,032
The sound Mom and Dad
will never forget.

210
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,470
For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.

211
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,736
Lights, please.
And that's having a baby.

212
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,471
Next week is our final class.

213
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,742
Susan, go deep.

214
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,587
-It's just impossible.
-What is, honey?

215
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,286
What that woman did.

216
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,899
I am not doing that.
It'll just have to stay in.

217
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,503
Everything will be the same.
It'll just stay in.

218
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:25,302
-Carol, honey, it'll be all right.
-What do you know?

219
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:31,143
No one's asking you, "Mind if we push
this pot roast through your nostril?"

220
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:36,118
Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.

221
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,983
I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

222
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,693
The birth part is just one day.

223
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,264
When it's over, we'll all be
parents for the rest of our lives.

224
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,169
I mean, that's what this is
all about, right? Ross?

225
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,898
Ross?

226
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,635
I'm gonna be a father.

227
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,875
-This is news to you?
-I knew I was having a baby.

228
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,675
I just never realized
the baby was having me.

229
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,784
-You'll be great.
-How can you say that?

230
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:12,150
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

231
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,585
-How will I raise a kid?
-Some scientists are now saying...

232
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,561
...that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

233
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,398
You might want to look into it.

234
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,006
-Where you going?
-Out.

235
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,766
With...?

236
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,341
Yes.

237
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,203
Can I just ask you one question?

238
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,009
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

239
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,880
You know, yet?

240
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,517
Not that it's any of your business,
but no, we haven't.

241
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,465
You meant sex, right?

242
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,445
-Do you have a sec?
-Sure. What's up?

243
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:17,481
The past few days, people have been
avoiding me and giving me weird looks.

244
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,851
Well, maybe that's because
they're jealous of us.

245
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:29,259
Maybe. But that doesn't explain
why they keep taking my scissors.

246
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,736
Maybe that's because
you're getting a big raise!

247
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,134
-I am?
-Sure. Why not?

248
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,436
Oh, my God! You're amazing!

249
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,904
You don't know.

250
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,244
Helen, do the paperwork
on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

251
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:52,317
You still want me to send her
psychological profile to Personnel?

252
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,984
Helen drinks.

253
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,560
Will you marry me?

254
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,805
So after the proposal,
I kind of unraveled.

255
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,643
Right. Because you were really
in control up until then.

256
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,505
-I told her everything.
-How'd she take it?

257
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,741
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

258
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,921
A tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation...

259
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,557
... never, ever leave your hand
on the desk.

260
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,650
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

261
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:40,202
Can we turn it off? Make them
go away because I can't watch.

262
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,305
Okay, they're gone.

263
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,735
Are you all right?

264
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,879
It's just this whole
stupid Ursula thing.

265
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:54,185
Pheebs, can I ask? So he's going out
with her. Is it really so terrible?

266
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,751
Yeah.

267
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,619
I'm not saying she's evil or anything.

268
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,387
She's just always breaking my stuff.

269
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:10,398
When I was 8, she threw my Judy Jetson
Thermos under the bus.

270
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,333
And then when I was 1 2,
she broke my collarbone.

271
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,936
She didn't mean to do it
but I think it still counts.

272
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,375
And then there's Randy Brown,
who was like

273
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,643
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was your best friend?

274
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,753
That's what he was for me.

275
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:38,555
And she kind of stole him away
and then broke his heart.

276
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,997
Then he wouldn't talk to me anymore.

277
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,934
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

278
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:55,141
I know Joey's not my boyfriend
or my thermos...

279
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,042
...or anything, but

280
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,910
-You won't lose him.
-You gotta talk to Joey.

281
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,080
-lf he knew how you felt
-But he's falling in love with her.

282
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,351
They've been going out a week.

283
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:14,464
They haven't even slept together yet.
That's not serious.

284
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,669
Okay. Okay.

285
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,521
May we help you?

286
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,436
What are you doing?
It's freezing! Come inside.

287
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:59,235
No, you wanted me to take them down...

288
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:03,005
...so I'm taking them down, okay?

289
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,412
Rachel!

290
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,921
I'm okay. I'm okay.

291
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,120
Mr. Heckles?

292
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,691
Mr. Heckles, could you
help me, please?

293
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,922
This is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.

294
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,367
My friend was taking down
Christmas lights...

295
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,807
...and may have broken her ankle.

296
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,744
My God, you still have
your Christmas lights up?

297
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:43,817
-Fill this out and bring it back.
-Here you go.

298
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:53,228
All right. Name, address.

299
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,901
-Are you currently on any medication?
-No.

300
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,900
Oh, wait! Yes. Blistex.

301
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:06,510
-No. In case of emergency, call...?
-You.

302
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,046
-Really?
-Yeah.

303
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,149
Oh, that is so sweet!

304
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,320
Gosh, love you. Okay, insurance?

305
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:22,482
Oh, yeah, check it.
Definitely gonna want some of that!

306
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,925
-You don't have insurance?
-How much will this cost?

307
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,929
X-rays alone could be $200!

308
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,968
-What are we gonna do?
-There's not much we can do.

309
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,903
Unless I use yours.

310
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:40,669
-No, no, no.
-Now wait a second.

311
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,076
Who did I just put
as my emergency person?

312
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,216
That's insurance fraud.

313
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:52,746
All right then, forget it.
Might as well just go home.

314
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:57,691
-Okay, come here. I hate this.
-Thank you. I love you.

315
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:03,092
Hi. I'm gonna need
a new set of these forms.

316
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:07,936
-Why?
-I am really an idiot.

317
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,867
I was filling out her form...

318
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,604
...and instead of putting
her information I put mine.

319
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,078
You are an idiot.

320
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:22,481
Yep, that's me. I am that stupid.

321
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:27,421
I had a dream. I was playing
football with my kid.

322
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:31,460
-That's nice.
-No, no. With him.

323
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,893
I'm on this field,
and they hike me the baby.

324
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:44,007
I've gotta do something. The Tampa Bay
defense is coming right at me!

325
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:49,112
-Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
-Right, but...

326
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:54,415
...it is just me and the baby,
so I'm thinking they can take us.

327
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:59,522
And so I just heave it downfield!

328
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:04,491
-What are you, crazy? That's a baby!
-He should take the sack?

329
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,058
Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.

330
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:15,205
And I realize I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him.

331
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,137
I know I'm not gonna
get there in time.

332
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,074
So I am running and running.
That is when I woke up.

333
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,716
See? I am so not ready
to be a father.

334
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,646
You're gonna be fine.

335
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:32,312
You're one of the most caring,
responsible men in North America.

336
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,789
You're gonna make a great dad.

337
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:38,621
Yeah, you and the baby
just need better blocking.

338
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,869
Have you ever been to
the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive?

339
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,938
Well, only if you order stuff.

340
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,367
I'm taking Ursula tonight.
It's her birthday.

341
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,705
-What about Phoebe's birthday?
-When's that?

342
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:02,309
-Tonight.
-What are the odds of that happening?

343
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,790
You take your time.

344
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,460
There it is!

345
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,367
-What'll you do?
-What can I do?

346
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,131
I don't wanna screw it up with Ursula.

347
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,466
And your friend?

348
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,577
If she's my friend, she'll understand.
Wouldn't you?

349
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,179
If you tried that on my birthday...

350
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,681
...you'd be staring at
the end of a hissy fit.

351
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,346
Saffron makes all the difference.

352
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,221
-Okay. Monica?
-Yes.

353
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:51,568
-Yes, she is.
-Hi, this is my friend Rachel.

354
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,864
-Hi, I'm Dr. Mitchell.
-And I'm Dr. Rosen.

355
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,802
I'm okay here.

356
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,739
Actually, that's all right.
You can take your break.

357
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:06,281
No, this is why I became a doctor.
Ankles and stuff like that.

358
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:10,446
-Aren't you too cute to be a doctor?
-Excuse me?

359
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:16,116
God, young, young. I meant young.
Young to be a doctor. Good, Rach.

360
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,988
-Thank you.
-Right.

361
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,832
He said it was just a sprain.

362
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,032
-You left out the stupid part.
-It's not stupid.

363
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,644
The cute doctors asked us out
for tomorrow, and I said yes.

364
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:40,146
I think it's insane.
They work for the hospital.

365
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,718
It's like returning
to the scene of the crime.

366
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:47,983
-I say we blow off the dates.
-What? They are cute.

367
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:51,959
They are doctors. Cute doctors.
Doctors who are cute.

368
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:55,098
All right, what have
we learned so far?

369
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,903
Oh, God. Okay.

370
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,807
Surprise!

371
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,285
What are you doing?
You scared the crap out of me!

372
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:22,357
-Was that the cake?
-Yeah. I got a lemon schmoosh.

373
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,085
Come on. She'll be here any minute.

374
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,696
Hope it's okay.

375
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,171
"Happy Birthday Peehee."

376
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,669
Maybe we can make a "B" out of a rose.

377
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,606
We'll just use
our special cake tools.

378
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,007
-What's going on?
-We just

379
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,273
Surprise!

380
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:53,953
This is so great! Oh, my God!
This was not at all scary.

381
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,720
Look! "Happy Birthday Peehee."

382
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,262
What a strange new nickname.
I like it! Oh, my God!

383
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,594
Hi, everybody. Hi, Betty! Betty, hi!

384
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,102
You found Betty!
Oh, my gosh! This is so great.

385
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:13,675
Everybody I love is in the same room.
Where's Joey?

386
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,941
Did you see Betty?

387
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,727
I wouldn't mind having a piece
of this sun-dried tomato business.

388
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:37,766
Five years ago, if somebody had said,
"A tomato that's like a prune"...

389
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,631
... I'd have said, "Get out!"

390
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,108
Dad, before I was born,
did you freak out?

391
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:50,748
I'm not freaking out! I'm saying,
if someone had come to me

392
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:54,817
Dad, I'm talking about
the whole baby thing.

393
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,886
Did you ever get this sort of...

394
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,217
... panicky, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be a father" thing?

395
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,623
No. We just had kids back then.

396
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:12,394
We didn't think about it.
What else could the sun dry, I wonder?

397
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,094
Dad, come on. IKids.

398
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:19,299
Look, your mother really did the work.
I was busy with the business.

399
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,571
I wasn't around that much.
Is that what this is about?

400
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,544
No, I was just wondering.

401
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,186
We can make up for that.
We can do stuff together.

402
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:34,448
You always wanted to go to Colonial
Williamsburg. Let's do that.

403
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:39,187
Thanks, Dad, really.
You know, I just....

404
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,128
I just needed to know...

405
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,894
...when did you start
to feel like a father?

406
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:51,774
Well, I guess it must've been
the day after you were born.

407
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,710
We were in the hospital room,
your mom was asleep...

408
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,475
...and they brought you in
and gave you to me.

409
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,120
You were this ugly little red thing.

410
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:07,519
All of a sudden you grabbed
my finger with your fist...

411
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,593
...and you squeezed it so tight.

412
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,530
And that's when I knew.

413
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,401
So you don't wanna go
to Williamsburg?

414
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,406
We can go to Williamsburg.

415
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,740
Eat your fish.

416
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:37,547
-Rachel, the cute doctors are here!
-Okay, coming.

417
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,451
-Hi, come on in.
-Hi, Jeffrey.

418
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:42,818
We brought wine.

419
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:47,487
Look. It's from the cellars
of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.

420
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,960
-How could we resist?
-That's great!

421
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,800
-Monica, how's the ankle?
-It's....

422
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:59,403
Why don't you tell them?
After all, it is your ankle.

423
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,704
It's feeling a lot better.
Thank you.

424
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,712
Why don't you guys sit down,
and we'll get you some glasses?

425
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:10,115
Okay. Stat!

426
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:18,526
Why don't we just tell them
who we really are? It'll be fine.

427
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,928
-We'll get in trouble.
-Would you stop being such a wuss?

428
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:27,002
A wuss? Excuse me
for living in the real world.

429
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,503
-So?
-So they still seem normal.

430
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,072
Because they are.

431
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,506
When we go out with women
from the hospital

432
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:39,945
Relax. Take a look around.
There are no pagan altars.

433
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:46,122
No piles of bones in the corners.
They're fine. Go like this:

434
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,063
We're not going to do it.
Sometimes you can be such a baby!

435
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,496
-I am not a baby.
-Be serious. Every time

436
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,830
-You act like a princess.
-You know what?

437
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,705
Every day you are becoming more
and more like your mother. Excuse me.

438
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,378
Here we go.

439
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,308
Great place.
How long have you lived here?

440
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,486
I've been here about six years.

441
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,985
And Rachel moved in a few months ago.

442
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:25,185
See, I was supposed to get married,
but I left the guy at the altar.

443
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,162
-Really?
-Yeah.

444
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:36,102
Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish,
but hey, that's me!

445
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,146
-Try the hummus.
-Monica, what do you do?

446
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,646
I am a chef at a restaurant uptown.

447
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,877
-Good for you.
-Yeah, it is.

448
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:56,222
Mostly because I get to boss people
around, which I just love to do.

449
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:01,593
-This hummus is great.
-God bless the chickpea.

450
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:10,364
Oh, God! I am so spoiled!

451
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,203
That's it.

452
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,245
I shoplift.

453
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:26,414
You had no idea that lipstick
was in your pocket.

454
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:30,788
Did I tell you that I think
I'm so much cuter than I am?

455
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,161
And have I mentioned that back
in high school I was a cow?

456
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,961
I used to wet my bed.

457
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:44,306
I use my breasts
to get people's attention.

458
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,440
We both do that!

459
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,488
Monica and Rachel's apartment.

460
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,758
Just one second.
Rachel, it's your dad.

461
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,627
Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me.

462
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,869
Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.

463
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,168
But there's something....

464
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,370
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

465
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:27,415
-Excuse me.
-Remember back in freshman year?

466
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:31,054
Well, Billy Dreskin
and I had sex on your bed.

467
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,693
Daddy.

468
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,136
Why? Why would I sleep
with Billy Dreskin?

469
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,933
His father tried to put you
out of business! You are dead!

470
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,477
Hey, Rachel? Are these your condoms?

471
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:04,618
Oh, no, that was just Monica.
She's drunk again.

472
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:10,519
I don't think "scrunchy" is a word.

473
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,629
Why not, if "crunchy" is a word?

474
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,795
Then I'm using that same argument
for "fligament."

475
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,735
-Ross, he's got the remote again.
-Good.

476
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:28,002
Maybe he can switch it back.

477
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,673
Maybe not.

478
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,281
Okay, Daddy? That's the other line.

479
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,354
Okay, no, not even in my bedroom.

480
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:43,721
Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.

481
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,327
Hello?

482
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,894
Hold on a second. Let me check
and see if she's here.

483
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,370
It's the woman from the hospital.
There's a problem.

484
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,874
-What do we do?
-Just find out what they want.

485
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,171
Okay. No, you do it.

486
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:08,185
Hello. This is Monica. Yeah?

487
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:12,345
Oh, okay. Yes, we'll be right down.
Thank you.

488
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,719
We forgot to sign one
of the admissions forms.

489
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:22,263
You were right. This was just
not worth it. Let me just change.

490
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,893
-"Garge"?
-Nautical term.

491
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,435
-Cheating man.
-Okay.

492
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,476
-She still didn't call?
-No.

493
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,238
Trouble?

494
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,146
Your sister stood me up.

495
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:44,014
Don't you hate it
when people aren't there for you?

496
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,282
-What is that?
-"Tushy."

497
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,660
-Did you try calling her?
-For two days.

498
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,629
At the restaurant
they said she was busy.

499
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,565
I can't believe she's blowing me off!

500
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:21,219
-We had the two chef salads.
-And how were they?

501
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:28,031
No, we haven't had them yet.
We're still hoping to have them.

502
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,529
Okay.

503
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:45,947
-You got a minute?
-Yeah, I'm just working.

504
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,987
So.

505
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:01,722
-I got you a birthday present.
-Wow, you remembered.

506
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,134
-It's a Judy Jetson thermos.
-Like the kind you

507
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:15,335
Right. Oh, I got
something for you too.

508
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:20,882
-How'd you know I was coming?
-Yeah, twin thing.

509
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,678
I can't believe you did this.

510
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,791
I can't believe you did this.

511
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:35,062
So, what's the deal with you and Joey?

512
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,200
Oh, right. He is so great.
But that's over.

513
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,971
-Does he know?
-Who?

514
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:48,471
Joey. You know,
he's really nutsy about you.

515
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,739
-He is? Why?
-You got me.

516
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:56,909
Right. Excuse me, doesn't this
come with a side salad?

517
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,223
So are you gonna call him?

518
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,325
-You think he likes me?
-No. Joey.

519
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:08,328
Oh! No, he is so smart.
He'll figure it out.

520
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,794
Do you want some chicken?

521
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,367
No. No food with a face.

522
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:18,833
-You have not changed.
-Yeah, you too.

523
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:23,713
Thanks. Excuse me? My side salad?

524
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,581
Service here is horrible.
Now I know what people mean.

525
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,947
Hi! Remember us?

526
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,593
You called about needing
a signature on the form?

527
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,298
Well, it turns out we need a new one.

528
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:47,265
Because, you see,
I put the wrong name again.

529
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:51,396
-Because
-You're that stupid!

530
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,141
I am. I'm that stupid.

531
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,837
And I'm gonna pay
for this with a check.

532
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,107
Your insurance will cover that.

533
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,047
I know. I'm just not
that bright either.

534
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:12,790
Mon, I'm sorry. I don't think
you're like your mother.

535
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,455
That's all right. And I don't
think you were selfish.

536
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,028
Oh, and I'm sorry I said
you were a cow.

537
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:23,263
That's okay, I was a cow.

538
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:28,104
I know. I'm just sorry I said it.

539
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:34,309
Worst case scenario:
Say you never feel like a father.

540
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,750
Say your son never feels
connected to you as one.

541
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,585
Say all of his relationships
are affected by this.

542
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:47,856
-Do you have a point?
-You know, you'd think I would.

543
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,067
What's up with the simian?

544
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,797
-It's just a fur ball.
-All right.

545
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,575
-Whose turn?
-Yours. I got 43 points for "kidney."

546
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:05,340
No, you got zero points for "idney."

547
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:08,541
I had a "K." Where's my "K"?

548
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,885
You've got to help me!
My monkey swallowed a "K"!

549
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:23,226
-Get that animal out!
-The animal hospital is across town.

550
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,926
-What's going on?
-Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.

551
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,298
Excuse me.
This hospital is for people!

552
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,272
He is people! He has a name, okay?

553
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:39,711
He watches Jeopardy!, he touches
himself when nobody's watching.

554
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,847
Please, have a heart.

555
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,282
-I'll take a look at him.
-Thanks.

556
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,580
-Michael!
-Rachel.

557
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,848
-What?
-Monica.

558
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,839
Urs, what are you doing here?
I've been trying to call you.

559
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,273
Listen....

560
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,474
Don't say "listen."
I know that "listen." I've said that.

561
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:18,777
-I'm sorry.
-I don't get it. What happened?

562
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,981
What about what
you said under the bridge?

563
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:28,062
Yeah. You should just forget about
what I said under the bridge.

564
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,996
I was talking crazy that night.
I was so drunk.

565
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:37,105
-You don't drink.
-That's right, I don't.

566
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:41,435
-But I was drunk on you.
-Oh, Urs

567
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,374
But it's not gonna work.

568
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,881
Why? Is it because
I'm friends with Phoebe?

569
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,781
Would you stop hanging out with her?

570
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,949
No, I couldn't do that.

571
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,028
Then yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

572
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,858
So, you know, it's either her or me.

573
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:08,564
Then I'm sorry.

574
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:16,941
You know, you're gonna be
really hard to get over.

575
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,215
I know.

576
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:29,523
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what.

577
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:34,061
-But you've never looked so beautiful.
-Really?

578
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,820
-Pheebs?
-Yeah.

579
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,798
He looks so tiny.

580
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,341
-We just heard.
-ls he okay?

581
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,070
The doctor got the "K" out.

582
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,545
He also found an "M" and an "O."

583
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,750
We think he was trying
to spell out "monkey."

584
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:41,591
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

585
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:46,294
-So, you feel like a dad yet?
-No. Why?

586
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,573
Come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

587
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,971
-That's very "dad."
-Look. He's waking up.

588
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,772
Hey, fella. How you doing?

We're running low on resumes.

00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,347
You want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

3
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:23,579
If you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones.

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,654
Guys, I'm going for anything here.
I can't be a waitress anymore.

00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:33,993
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called "Excuse Me."

Okay, we're almost done.
Only 20 more to go.

9
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:52,677
-Rach, did you proofread these?
-Yeah. Why?

10
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,885
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your "compuper" skills.

11
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:03,195
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's on all of them?

12
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,129
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.

13
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,839
The One With the Poker

14
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:14,767
They call this a love seat but I'm not
feeling anything special towards you.

15
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,507
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

16
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,106
Hi, ladies.

17
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,773
Can I get you anything?
Did you bring the mail?

18
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,286
-Lots of responses.
-Really? Sure, we have scones left!

19
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,880
Read them.

20
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:43,654
"Dear Miss Greene:
Thank you for your inquiry. However"

21
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:50,265
-We have apple cinnamon
-"Dear Ms. Greene...." Yeah, yeah! No.

22
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,438
-What?
-Your Visa bill is huge!

23
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,936
Give me that.

24
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,574
Linda's great.
Why won't you go out with her?

25
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,079
-I don't know.
-ls this about her...

26
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,583
... "The Flintstones could
have really happened" thing?

27
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:12,417
It's not just that. I want someone
who does something for me...

28
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,616
...who gets my heart pounding.

29
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,696
Who makes me....

30
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,324
Little playthings with yarn?

31
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,768
What?

32
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,804
Could you want her more?

33
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,230
Who?

34
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,934
Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!!.

35
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,150
Look, I'm totally over her.

36
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,653
-Hi!
-Coffee?

37
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,348
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.

38
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,791
-Shut up!
-We're not saying anything.

39
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,630
-What?
-Joey cried last night.

40
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,306
-Thank you.
-We were playing poker

41
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,775
There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight.

42
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,439
You should have seen him.
"Read them and weep!"

43
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,482
And then he did.

44
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:18,487
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

45
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,787
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

46
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:27,160
-It's poker, so only guys can play?
-No. Women can play.

47
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:32,134
Then, what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know

48
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,329
All right, what is it?

49
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,969
There are just no women
in our game.

50
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,977
We just don't know any
women who know how to play poker.

51
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,617
That is a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.

52
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,786
Do you know how to play?

53
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,219
No.

54
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,350
-But you could teach us.
-No.

55
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,660
Okay, so now we draw cards.

56
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,968
So I wouldn't need any.
I have a straight.

57
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,110
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!

58
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:18,381
-Pheebs, how many do you want?
-I just need two.

59
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,179
The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs.

60
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,689
-No, you can't
-I have the 10 of spades! Here.

61
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,485
Thanks!

62
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:34,492
-No, you can't do that.
-Don't need them. I'm going for fours.

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,396
Oh, you're

64
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,004
You're going for fours.
Chandler, could you? Thanks, man.

65
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,173
Here we go.

66
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,475
We've got salmon roulettes
and crudites.

67
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,515
What are you doing?

68
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,554
In poker, there's no food
with more than one syllable.

69
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,818
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz

70
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:08,261
I hope you'll let it slide just
this once. I was all out of "pretz."

71
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,998
Now the dealer

72
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,935
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes. Big bucks!

73
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:20,169
You sure? Phoebe just threw away two
jacks because they didn't look happy.

74
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,785
But I'm ready. So just deal.

75
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:30,012
Okay, last-minute lesson!
Joey....

76
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,656
Three.

77
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:32,847
Eight.

78
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,623
Eight. Three.
All right, very good.

79
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,531
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

80
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,262
Joey had two fives showing,
so for you to raise was

81
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,167
Yes?

82
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,638
Downright gutsy.

83
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,971
-I see, so you were lying.
-About what?

84
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,345
-About how good your cards were.
-I was bluffing.

85
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,584
And what is bluffing?

86
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,821
Is it not another word for lying?

87
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:13,226
Sorry to break up this party, but I've
got to go fax resumes before work.

88
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,901
-We've got to settle.
-Settle what?

89
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,165
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

90
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,969
See, King George is giving us
the land....

91
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:31,877
-The game, Rachel. You owe us money.
-Right.

92
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,747
It's their first time.
Let's forget about the money.

93
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,583
Hell, no. We'll pay!

94
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,158
Monica, I had another
answer all ready.

95
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,124
And you know what?
We want a rematch.

96
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,893
That's fine with me.
Could use some money.

97
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:56,465
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-Well, yeah, I am.

98
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:01,107
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

99
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,980
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from KEA.

100
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,548
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.

101
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,092
Look, this is poker.
I play to win.

102
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,762
For me to win,
others have to lose.

103
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,491
If you're gonna play,
don't expect me to be nice.

104
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,636
Because once those cards are dealt....

105
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,337
Yeah?

106
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,180
I'm not a nice guy.

107
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,188
All right, let's eat.

108
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:53,229
Did you get that
from the "I Love Rachel Pizzeria"?

109
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,500
-You still on that?
-What was with that Black Bart speech?

110
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,070
"When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy."

111
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,240
You're way off.

112
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:07,071
No, I don't think so,
because I think you love her!

113
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:12,512
No. I might have had feelings
for her at one time. Not anymore.

114
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,776
I just

115
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,319
Marcel! Where are you going
with that disk?

116
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,014
You are not putting that on again.

117
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,185
If you press that button,
you are in very big trouble.

118
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,655
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

119
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:01,390
-Yeah, I know.
-He can get really competitive.

120
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,302
What?

121
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,969
"Hello, kettle? This is Monica.
You're black!"

122
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,006
Please!

123
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,874
I'm not as bad as Ross.

124
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,540
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

125
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,849
That wasn't an incident.

126
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:26,491
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

127
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,797
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

128
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,764
Saks Fifth Avenue.

129
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,664
Oh, Rachel!

130
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,596
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

131
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,071
-What's the job?
-Assistant buyer.

132
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,084
I would be shopping!

133
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,654
For a living!

134
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,949
That's Aunt lris. She's been
playing poker since she was 5.

135
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,130
You've got to listen
to every word she says.

136
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,532
-ls Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.

137
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,397
-He may be now. I hit him with my car.
-My God, really?

138
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,063
No, that's bluffing.
Lesson number one.

139
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:22,938
Let me tell you something. Everything
you hear at a poker game is pure crap!

140
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,640
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

141
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:32,654
-Girls, sit down.
-Aunt lris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.

142
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,760
Listen, I'm parked at a meter.
Let's do it. Okay?

143
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,098
We'll start with five-card draw.

144
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:46,238
Then we'll go into the studs and the
hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan.

145
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,897
Don't touch the cards
when somebody is dealing.

146
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,705
How is Nathan?

147
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,476
Now he thinks he's a man
in a woman's body.

148
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,779
Don't you mean
a woman in a man's body?

149
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,452
It should be so simple.

150
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,471
Ross, could we please listen
to anything else?

151
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,572
All right.

152
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,683
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

153
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,632
Hi. Guys, guess what?

154
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:52,668
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they're all recommending Trident?

155
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,736
No, the interview!

156
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,047
Unbelievable!
She absolutely loved me.

157
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,152
We talked for over two hours.
We've the same taste in clothes.

158
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,788
And I went to camp with her cousin.

159
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,450
-The job is perfect! I can do this.
-That's great!

160
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,757
-Then she told a funny story.
-Great, tell us and we'll laugh.

161
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,990
Let's play poker!

162
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:27,929
Listen, we talked about it and
if you don't wanna play, it's okay.

163
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,077
Yes, we can play some other game.
Like Pictionary?

164
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,245
Very funny.

165
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:40,475
-But we'd like to try poker again.
-Yes, I think we should.

166
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:46,386
-Do you want me to shuffle those?
-That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

167
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,226
So Pheebs owes $7. 50.
Monica owes $10.00.

168
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,429
And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

169
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:07,610
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed
Mary. We gotta play that other way.

170
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,349
All right, here's my $7.50.
But this money is cursed.

171
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,179
-What?
-I cursed it!

172
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,389
Now bad things will happen
to the spender.

173
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,560
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

174
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,997
This way, I can split them up
with a movie.

175
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,501
So that just leaves the big Greene
poker machine, who owes 1 5.

176
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,566
Could you be any smugger?

177
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,370
Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up
a new art gallery...

178
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:45,607
...and I could sure use the portraits
of Lincoln and Hamilton.

179
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,283
It's so typical.
"I'm a man! I have a penis!

180
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,688
I have to win money
to exert my power over women!"

181
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,288
This isn't over.

182
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,693
We'll play you again.
We'll win. You'll lose.

183
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,632
You'll beg. We'll laugh.

184
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:11,071
We'll take every last dime you have.
And you'll hate yourselves forever!

185
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,339
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

186
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,949
I can't believe you lost!
How much did they take?

187
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,052
Like 30 bucks.

188
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,950
-I'll give you that money back.
-Really?

189
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:29,059
No, I'm bluffing!
You guys haven't learned crap!

190
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,425
-Hand me the cards!
-Can l?

191
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,430
Yes!

192
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:48,504
Wanna give us your money now? We can
skip the formality of really playing.

193
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:53,048
No, that's fine. We'll see who has
the last laugh, monkey boy.

194
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,118
Done with chitchat?
Ready for serious poker?

195
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:03,421
You guys, look! The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.

196
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,562
Right. Serious poker.

197
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:11,464
-Mon, got any more of those salmon?
-You want to eat or play poker?

198
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,833
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

199
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,838
Want to go to the bathroom
or play poker?

200
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,670
Go to the bathroom.

201
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,641
-Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
-No!

202
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,753
I'm waiting to hear from that job.
The store closes at 9:00. Eat then.

203
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:34,153
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.

204
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,194
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody, ante.

205
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,387
Yes!

206
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,534
Or no.

207
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:50,501
-All right! Your money's mine, Greene.
-Your fly's open, Geller.

208
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:02,411
You know what I just realized?
Joker is poker with a "J"!

209
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,224
Coincidence?

210
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:11,395
That's jo-incidence with a "C"!

211
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,205
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, I'm out.

212
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,873
-I'm in.
-Me too.

213
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,946
Me too.
What do you got?

214
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:36,350
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

215
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,885
Well, well, well!

216
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,927
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes!

217
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:50,192
I got four sixes! I won!
I actually won! Oh, my God!

218
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,496
You know what?
I'll make a little Ross pile.

219
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,865
Look!

220
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,977
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think that one was Ross'.

221
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,248
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it

222
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,715
And your fly's still open

223
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,921
I made you look

224
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,385
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be in-er.

225
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,188
Monica, in or out?

226
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,690
I hate this game!

227
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,973
Joey, your bet.

228
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,406
I fold like a hooker
who got hit in the stomach...

229
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,648
... by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

230
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,380
I'm out.

231
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,084
-Ross?
-I'm very in.

232
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,989
-Chandler?
-Couldn't be more out.

233
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,992
Me too. Rachel?

234
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:58,393
I will see you and I'll raise you.
Do you wanna waste another buck?

235
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,102
No, not this time.
What did you have?

236
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,207
-I'm not telling.
-Show them.

237
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,467
-No.
-Show them!

238
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,773
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.

239
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:15,044
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?

240
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,587
Your whole face is getting red.
Veins popping out of your temple!

241
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,159
Plus, that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

242
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,299
-I'm not losing.
-You're definitely losing.

243
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,471
Hello. Rachel Greene.

244
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,207
Excuse me. It's about the job!

245
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,142
Barbara, hi! How are you?

246
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,249
No, I understand.

247
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:54,021
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly. Yeah.

248
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,992
But if anything else
opens up, please

249
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,824
Hello?

250
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,177
Sorry, Rach.

251
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,620
There's gonna be lots
of other stuff.

252
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,345
Okay.

253
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,190
Where were we?

254
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:33,760
Five-card draw. Jacks are better.
Nothing wild. Everybody, ante.

255
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:39,366
-Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.
-Yes, we do.

256
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,766
-All right. Check.
-Check.

257
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,270
-I'm in for 50 cents.
-Call.

258
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,276
I'm in.

259
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,275
I see your 50 cents...

260
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,976
...and I raise you $5.

261
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,154
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

262
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,293
I just lost a job,
I'd like to raise it $5.

263
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,962
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

264
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,725
-Not at all.
-No.

265
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,427
Loser?

266
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:25,181
-No, I fold.
-What do you mean, you fold?

267
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:29,820
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

268
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,649
Were you just full of it?

269
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:46,829
I'm in.

270
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,834
-How many do you want?
-One.

271
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,277
Dealer takes two.

272
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,580
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

273
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,117
Okay. I see your $2...

274
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,050
...and I raise you...

275
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,019
... 20.

276
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,695
I see your $20...

277
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,791
... raise you $25.

278
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,370
I see your $25
and Monica, get my purse.

279
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,711
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

280
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,278
Okay, then get me your purse.

281
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,196
-Here you go. Good luck!
-Thank you.

282
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,259
I saw your $25 and I raise you...

283
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,793
...seven.

284
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,930
teen!

285
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,506
Joey, I'm a little shy.

286
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,047
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

287
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,961
-What do you need?
-1 5.

288
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,096
-Here's 10.
-I got 5.

289
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,390
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

290
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,131
I am calling your 1 7.

291
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,168
What do you got?

292
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,842
Full house.

293
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,851
You got me.

294
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:01,301
-That's tough to beat.
-I thought we had it!

295
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:05,408
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

296
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,044
But look how happy she is.

297
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,824
-Airmail.
-Airplane. Airport. Airport '75!

298
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,257
Airport '77! Airport '79!

299
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,455
Time's up!

300
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,293
Bye Bye Birdie!

301
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,229
That's a bird?

302
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,770
That's a bird!

303
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,943
Okay, it's my turn.

304
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,878
Go!

305
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,516
Bean! Bean!

306
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,421
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!

307
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,387
That you get?

308
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,858
That you get?!

00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,248
The One Where The Monkey Gets Away

7
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,632
Mail call!
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

8
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,468
Thank you.

9
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,942
Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.

10
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,049
Oh, good. Because where else
would we get any?

11
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,582
Oh, right.

12
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,589
-Oh, great.
-What is it?

13
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,622
Country club newsletter.

14
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,661
My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,365
Oh, my God! It's Barry and Mindy!

16
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,467
Barry, who you almost

17
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,264
And Mindy, your maid of

18
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,032
Let me see. That's Mindy?

19
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,470
She is pretty!

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,040
Lucky...

21
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,211
...to have had a friend like you.

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,545
Now it's quiet time.

23
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,029
Marcel, bring me the rice. Come on.

24
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,994
Good boy. Give me the rice.

25
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,928
Thank you. Good boy.

26
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,468
He's mastered the difference between
"bring me the" and "pee in the."

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,810
"Bring me the" and
Rach?

28
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,179
This is so stupid!

30
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,580
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

31
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,847
I should be happy for them.

32
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,752
I am. I'm happy for them.

33
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,793
-Really?
-No.

34
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,990
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,565
Whoa, what....

36
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,034
What happened to "Forget
relationships! I'm done with men!"

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,073
The whole penis embargo?

38
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,640
I don't know.

39
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:07,080
It's not about no guys.
It's about the right guy.

40
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,517
With Barry it was safe and easy,
but there was no heat.

41
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,125
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

42
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,992
-lt was this raw, animal, sexual
-Right. I got it.

43
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,061
I was there.

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,197
Do you think you can have both?

45
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:30,172
Someone who's your best friend
but also can make your toes curl.

46
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,469
Yes.

47
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,204
Yes, I do. I really do.

48
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
In fact, it's funny.

49
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,920
Often, someone
you wouldn't think could...

50
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,385
...curl your toes...

51
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,956
... might just be the one who...

52
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,792
...gets interrupted.

53
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,654
How was the movie?

54
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,558
-Wonderful!
-So good!

55
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,700
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.

56
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:02,434
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with guns and bombs...

57
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,872
...and buses going really fast!

58
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,807
I don't need violence
in a movie...

59
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,745
...as long as
there's a little nudity.

60
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,510
-There was nudity.
-I meant female nudity.

61
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,090
I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

62
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,227
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

63
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,288
All right, I've got to go.

64
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,932
Come on, Marcel.

65
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,934
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

66
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,431
They're still just friends, right?

67
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,805
And I will see you tomorrow.

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,072
You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

69
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,117
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

70
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,187
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

71
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,688
Unclench. You're not even
gonna be here.

72
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:05,103
-I can't believe we're discussing this.
-I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

73
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,130
If it was gonna happen,
wouldn't it have happened already?

74
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,969
She said she wants a relationship
with someone exactly like me.

75
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,475
She said that?

76
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,014
I added the exactly like me" part.

77
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:23,879
But she's looking for someone.
And someone will be there tonight.

78
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,388
"Tonight" tonight?

79
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,456
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.

80
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,290
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

81
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,363
I can't remember the last time
a girl took care of my monkey.

82
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,335
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd pick up some wine...

83
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,243
...go over there and try to woo her.

84
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,342
Know what you should do?

85
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,853
Take her back to the 1 890s
when that phrase was last used.

86
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,757
If you keep this up, you'll be
finished by the weekend.

87
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,259
The one in the feathered boa
is Dr. Francis.

88
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,834
Now, she used to be a man.

89
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,903
Look, there's Raven.

90
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,508
We hate her. We're glad she's dying.

91
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,176
And then
What? Marcel!

92
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,549
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to

93
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,289
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

94
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,254
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

95
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,422
Oh, God!

96
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,533
Sorry, Barry.

97
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,128
A little engagement gift.

98
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,306
I'm sure you didn't
register for that.

99
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,212
Who died? Who died?

100
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,148
Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!

101
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:06,454
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because

102
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,648
Marcel?

103
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,131
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!

104
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,736
We were watching TV,
he pooped in Monica's shoe....

105
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,872
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

106
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,974
I don't know. The left one!

107
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,235
Which ones?

108
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,779
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

109
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,649
Why is the air in here so negative?

110
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,319
Rachel lost Marcel.

111
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,581
Oh, no! How?

112
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,819
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

113
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,326
The cute black ones I always wear.

114
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,690
No, which one?

115
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,334
The right or left?

116
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,897
Because the left one is lucky.

117
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,902
Come on!
What am I gonna do?

118
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,669
All right. You're a monkey.
You're loose in the city.

119
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,879
Where do you go?

120
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:05,081
It's his first time out,
so he'll do touristy things.

121
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,954
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

122
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,187
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!

123
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,919
He'll be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me!

124
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,362
Search the building. Take the first
floor. We'll take the rest.

125
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,967
What am I gonna do?

126
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,671
You stay here
and wait by the phone.

127
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,468
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

128
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,042
Does anybody want to trade?

129
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,786
What do you want?

130
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,355
Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey?

131
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,959
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

132
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,498
-Why'd you leave it in the hall?
-I wasn't ready for it.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,991
Have you seen a monkey?

134
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,000
I saw Regis Philbin once.

135
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,871
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

136
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,704
You owe me a waffle.

137
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,006
He's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face...

138
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:15,277
...with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

139
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,647
Thanks.

140
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,823
How did it go today?

141
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,927
Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.

142
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,493
Is that wine?

143
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,755
You want some?

144
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,695
Oh, I would love some.

145
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,267
But let's not drink it here.

146
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,201
I'm feeling crazy.
You wanna go to Newark?

147
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:44,515
Okay, but before we head off to
the murder capital of the Northeast...

148
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,012
... I kind of wanted
to run something by you.

149
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
You know how we
were talking before...

150
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,890
...about relationships, and stuff.

151
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,496
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.

152
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,199
Oh, God!

153
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,600
Okay, all right.
All right, okay.

154
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,836
Please don't hate me.

155
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,035
What?

156
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,781
You know Marcel?

157
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,781
I kind of lost him.

158
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,337
I can't believe this.

159
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,738
All I asked you to do was
keep him in here!

160
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,107
I know. I'm sorry.

161
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,215
It's partially my fault.

162
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,182
I shouldn't have had you
start with a monkey.

163
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,345
You should have started
with a pencil.

164
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,458
I'm doing everything I can.
Everyone's looking for him and I got

165
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,593
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.

166
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,860
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?

167
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,537
Why? Do you not like them?

168
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,209
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

169
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:31,415
I'm not allowed to have him. If they
find him, they'll take him away.

170
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,923
Well, now, see,
you never ever told us that.

171
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,858
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!

172
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,570
Thanks for coming.

173
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,933
Somebody called about a monkey?

174
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,633
You know, that was
a complete misunderstanding.

175
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,473
We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

176
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,582
-Turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!

177
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,481
We checked, no one's seen Marcel.

178
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:07,022
-My uncle Marcel.
-ls that who the monkey's named after?

179
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,953
Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable...

180
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,657
... by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

181
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:15,823
Oh, my God!

182
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,968
You'd put that poor
little creature in jail?

183
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:29,776
Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?

184
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,509
Yes, but there isn't always time.

185
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:40,655
I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.

186
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,328
We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller.

187
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,222
Oh, my God, you are!

188
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,126
And you're Rachel Greene!

189
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,463
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High?

190
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,038
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

191
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,973
Luisa! Oh, my God!

192
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,238
Monica! It's Luisa!

193
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,317
I went there too!

194
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,510
Luisa! From homeroom!

195
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,387
You have no idea who I am, do you?

196
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,184
-No.
-Not at all.

197
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:20,124
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

198
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:24,098
Would it have been hard to say,
"Morning, Luisa"...

199
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,669
...or "Nice overalls"?

200
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,802
Oh, I'm so sorry!

201
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:37,346
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

202
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,513
But you. What a bitch!

203
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,651
What?

204
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,291
You know what? Be that as it may...

205
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,589
...could you help us with the
monkey thing, for old times'sake?

206
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,765
Go, Bobcats!

207
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,301
I could. But I won't.

208
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,768
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

209
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,845
Sorry.

210
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,241
Marcel?

211
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:13,976
Marcel?

212
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,359
Hi, can I help you?

213
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,698
We're having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.

214
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,568
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

215
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,209
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

216
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,379
Can you fix radiators?

217
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,981
Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

218
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,185
-Of course!
-Oh. Then, no.

219
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,327
-Taste this. Is there too much rum?
-Just a second.

220
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,088
-Hope you find your monkey.
-No, wait!

221
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,034
We may not know about radiators...

222
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:08,239
... but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooling milieu.

223
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,177
Aren't we in the middle of something?

224
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,214
But these women are very hot,
and they need our help.

225
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,215
And they're very hot!

226
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,922
We can't, all right?

227
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,589
We're sorry.

228
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,727
You don't know how sorry.
We promised to find this monkey.

229
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,058
He's this high
and answers to the name Marcel.

230
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,600
So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.

231
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:50,376
From now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

232
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,950
-Oh, my God!
-What?

233
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,151
Something brushed up
against my right leg.

234
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,189
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.

235
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,756
Look, Phoebe!

236
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,561
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

237
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,329
Step aside, ladies.

238
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,102
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a tranquilizer.

239
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,858
Run, Marcel, run!

240
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,185
Damn!

241
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,763
-Are you okay?
-I think so.

242
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,198
Oh, gosh!

243
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,555
We've been all over the neighborhood!
He's just gone!

244
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,887
-You don't know that.
-It's cold, it's dark.

245
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,359
He doesn't know the Village!

246
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:17,501
And now I have a broken foot.
I have no monkey and a broken foot!

247
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:18,998
Thank you very much!

248
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,002
I've said I'm sorry a million times.

249
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,934
What do you want me to do?

250
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:28,110
You want me to break my foot too?
I'll break it right now.

251
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,771
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?

252
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,750
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign...

253
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,446
... I don't miss Marcel anymore!

254
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,455
It's not like
I did this on purpose.

255
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,755
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

256
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,795
Things just sort of happen around you!

257
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,698
You're off in "Rachel Land,"
doing your "Rachel Thing"...

258
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:57,239
...oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and

259
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,603
I don't want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?

260
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,673
What?

261
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,879
Hey, banana man!

262
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,192
This is so intense!

263
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:21,423
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

264
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,938
-What's with Phoebe?
-Tranquilizer dart.

265
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,806
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

266
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,468
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!

267
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,046
-I don't have a monkey.
-Then what's with the bananas?

268
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,275
Potassium.

269
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,954
Okay, where is he?

270
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,857
You're wasting your time.

271
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,758
What?

272
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:06,733
-What have you done to him?
-That's my monkey. That's Patty.

273
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,476
Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.

274
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,711
Come here, Patty.

275
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,409
Come here, Marcel.

276
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:16,979
Come here, Patty.

277
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,987
Here, monkey.

278
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,516
Here, monkey!

279
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,489
Gotcha!

280
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,723
-Give me my monkey back!
-It's mine.

281
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,922
Take this up with the judge.

282
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:32,695
That's not my monkey. The dress
is mine. Send it back whenever.

283
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,805
All right, I want my monkey!

284
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,999
-Oh, come on, Luisa.
-Sorry, prom queen.

285
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,441
You had to be a bitch in school,
instead of fat.

286
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,115
In high school, I was prom queen...

287
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,980
...and the homecoming queen and you...

288
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,054
...were also there.

289
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,918
But this isn't high school.
We're all adults here!

290
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,993
Heckles! Can I have this?

291
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,324
For the most part.

292
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:07,062
If you take this monkey, I'll lose
an important person in my life.

293
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:11,402
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

294
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,807
You have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

295
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,844
Take it!

296
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,009
No.

297
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,248
All right. Then I'll call
your supervisor and tell her...

298
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,292
...you shot my friend with a dart!

299
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,332
It'll be nice to get this off,
won't it?

300
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,507
Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

301
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:47,042
With the right pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

302
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,916
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard
on you before

303
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,248
No, it was my fault.
I almost lost your

304
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,154
Yeah, but you got him back.
You were great.

305
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,193
We still have that bottle of wine.

306
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,303
Are you in the mood
for something grape?

307
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,770
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.

308
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,049
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

309
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,821
Well, as long as we're here...

310
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,332
...and not on the subject....

311
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,935
I was thinking about...

312
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,301
... how mad we got
at each other before.

313
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,449
And maybe it was partially
because of how we

314
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,917
-Rachel?
-Barry?

315
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:07,715
I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

316
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,451
I think I'm still in love with you.

317
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,402
We have got to start
locking that door!

318
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,743
Show us! Come on!

319
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:32,883
-lt was such a long time ago.
-Okay, fine. All right.

320
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:37,249
This is me in The Sound of Music.
See the von Trapp kids?

321
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,353
That's because I'm in front of them.

322
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,388
Big nun!

323
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,425
I thought that was an alp.

324
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,827
High school wasn't
my favorite time.

325
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,194
I loved high school.

326
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,202
It was four years of parties,
dating and sex and

327
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,807
Well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

328
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,376
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

329
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,481
Doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

330
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,682
My butt cheek is waking up!

1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,268
I can't believe
you'd actually say that.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,804
I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,770
No way.
Mr. Salty is a sailor.

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,776
He's gotta be
the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,808
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with Cornnuts.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,878
They're crazy.

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,491
Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,060
There's some creep out there
with a telescope.

9
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,192
I can't believe it.
He's looking right at us.

10
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,332
Oh, that is so sick.

11
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,196
I feel violated.

12
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,200
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,898
How can people do that?

14
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:48,510
You guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,313
The One With the Evil Orthodontist

16
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,157
Years from now,
school children will study it...

17
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,394
...as one of the greatest
first dates ever.

18
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,006
-Yeah.
-I'll say, yeah.

19
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,834
It was unbelievable.

20
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,170
We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.

21
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,372
-Have you called her?
-She'd know I like her. That's crazy.

22
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,812
Guys. It's gross.

23
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,816
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

24
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,990
-I'm right. Right?
-Yeah, let her dangle.

25
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:11,593
I can't believe my parents are
pushing me to find one of you people.

26
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,164
Come on. Just do it.

27
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,734
Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.

28
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:23,308
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

29
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,571
-Her machine.
-Answering machine?

30
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,410
No, interestingly,
her leaf blower picked up.

31
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,918
So, why didn't you say anything?

32
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,217
No. Last time I left
a spontaneous message...

33
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,056
... I ended up using the phrase,
"Yes, indeed-io."

34
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,394
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look.

35
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,560
What's going on?

36
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,831
-They're just talking.
-Does he look upset?

37
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,510
Does he look like he was told
to shove anything?

38
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,111
No. Actually, he's smiling.

39
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,509
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

40
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,683
What? What? What?

41
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,651
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

42
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:16,695
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

43
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,897
See? Hey, Rach.

44
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,363
How'd it go?

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,533
You know, it was actually
really great.

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,501
Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.

47
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,645
I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.

48
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,609
Not a good day for birds.

49
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,578
Then we went to Bendel's.

50
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,548
And I told him not to, but he got me
a bottle of Chanel.

51
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:46,088
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you told him...

52
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:50,922
...to stop calling, stop sending
flowers and to leave you alone?

53
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,066
Right. Well, we never actually
got to that.

54
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,236
It was just so nice to see him again.

55
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,999
It was comfortable
and it was familiar.

56
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,841
It was just nice.

57
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,907
That's nice twice.

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,307
Isn't this the same Barry
who you left at the altar?

59
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,151
Where have you been?

60
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,122
It was different
with him today.

61
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,087
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.

62
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:24,922
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?

63
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,100
-Why?
-I have my reasons.

64
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,096
He's engaged to another woman...

65
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,209
...who happens to be
your ex-best friend?

66
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,976
All right.
I know it's stupid.

67
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,445
I'll see him this afternoon
and put an end to it.

68
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,116
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

69
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,391
No, it wasn't.

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,795
It was so nice
having this little sink here.

71
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:14,143
Then with authority, hang up.

72
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,806
Will you just leave her the message?

73
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,985
Okay. All right, fine.

74
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,250
"Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

75
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,854
Give me a call
when you get a chance.

76
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,793
Bye-bye.

77
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,862
Oh, God.

78
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,372
That's what you've been working on
for two hours?

79
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,840
Hey, I've been honing.

80
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:50,012
-What was with the dishes?
-She might think I'm in a restaurant.

81
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,379
I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here...

82
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,815
... honing for the last two hours?

83
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:01,355
-The telescope guy's doing it again.
-Oh, my God.

84
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,896
Go away.
Stop looking in here.

85
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,533
Great.
Now he's waving back.

86
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,629
We gotta do something.

87
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:17,968
I caught him looking into our place.
I feel like I can't do stuff.

88
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,709
What kind of stuff?

89
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,148
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff...

90
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,446
...but, like,
when I'm cooking naked.

91
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,051
You cook naked?

92
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,726
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

93
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,627
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

94
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,503
What's the matter?

95
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,833
I just
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

96
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,010
No, it was.
It was very, very good.

97
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,738
-What about Mindy?
-Way better than Mindy.

98
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,747
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

99
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,354
If you want, I'll
break it off with her.

100
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,493
No, don't do that.
Not for me.

101
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,288
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush
is here for his adjustment.

102
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,261
Thanks, Bernice.

103
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,632
Let's go away this weekend.

104
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,936
-This is all way too
-No, we can go to Aruba.

105
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,143
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon...

106
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:29,280
...it was really nice.
You would've liked it.

107
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,974
I had a bra.

108
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,797
Hey, Dr. Farber.

109
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,660
All right, Miss Greene,
everything looks fine.

110
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,797
We're starting to see
some real progress.

111
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,667
-What?
-I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.

112
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,682
Can I use your phone?

113
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,985
For future reference,
that thing in your hand...

114
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,423
...can also be used as a phone.

115
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,660
Yes, it's working.

116
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,402
-Why isn't she calling?
-Maybe she never got your message.

117
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,043
Call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps...

118
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,405
...that means she didn't get
her messages yet.

119
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:38,707
-Doesn't that make me seem?
-Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

120
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,442
You obviously saw my personal ad.

121
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,387
How many beeps?

122
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,115
She answered.

123
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,227
This is where you'd use
that "hello" word.

124
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,623
I won't talk to her.
She got my message...

125
00:08:55,902 --> 00:09:00,134
...and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

126
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,003
God, I miss just being needy.

127
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,201
So how'd he take it?

128
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,947
Pretty well, actually.

129
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,946
How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

130
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,621
Oh, do l?

131
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:26,091
-We ended up having sex in his chair.
-You had sex in his chair?

132
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,600
I said that a little
too loudly, didn't l?

133
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,499
You had what?

134
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,811
Sex in his chair.

135
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,284
What...? What were you thinking?

136
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,612
I don't know.
We still care about each other.

137
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,813
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

138
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,753
It's nothing like me and Carol.

139
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,956
If she said to you,
"Ross, I want you on this couch...

140
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,862
... right here, right now,"
what would you say?

141
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,000
If it helps, I could slide over.

142
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:15,110
It's a totally different situation.
It's apples and oranges.

143
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,977
It's orthodontists and lesbians
I gotta go.

144
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,920
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go.

145
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,318
I have things to do with my life.

146
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,822
I have a jam-packed schedule.

147
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,622
And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?

148
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,909
Mindy.

149
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,176
How are you?

150
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,542
Yes, I heard. Congratulations.
That is so great.

151
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,811
Really, oh, God

152
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:04,388
I'm working tomorrow, but if you
want, you can come by if you'd like.

153
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,622
Great.

154
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,266
Great.

155
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,605
So I'll see you tomorrow.

156
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,400
Okay. Bye.

157
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,104
Oh, God. Oh, God.

158
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,375
So how's Mindy?

159
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,582
She wants to see me tomorrow. She
sounded weird. I gotta call Barry.

160
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,455
It's me. I just
Mindy.

161
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,421
Mindy. No, I figured
that's where you'd be.

162
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,314
Hell is filled
with people like you.

163
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,187
He's back.
The peeper's back.

164
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,156
-Get down.
-Get down?

165
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,788
And boogie.

166
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,325
I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

167
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,160
She may not even know.

168
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:24,000
I haven't heard from her in seven
months, what else is it about?

169
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,235
She was my best friend.

170
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,243
We went to camp together,
she taught me how to kiss....

171
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,120
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman.

172
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,256
-I feel so
-Naughty.

173
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,853
-See you later.
-I'll walk with you.

174
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:49,625
When she taught you to kiss, were you
wearing any kind of little uniform?

175
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,197
That's fine, yeah.

176
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,772
I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

177
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,912
-Take it with you.
-We haven't had a second date...

178
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,605
-...she needs to hear me pee?
-Why don't you call her?

179
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,048
I can't. I left a message.
I have some pride.

180
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,222
-Do you?
-No.

181
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,085
Danielle, hi.

182
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,265
It's Chandler.

183
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,932
I'm fine.

184
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,432
Listen....

185
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,368
I don't know if you tried
to call me because...

186
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,475
... I accidentally shut off my phone.

187
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,579
That's fine. That's great. Okay.

188
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,745
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

189
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,788
She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back.

190
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,993
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.

191
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,927
-Mindy.
-Hey, you.

192
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,332
Hey, you.

193
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,302
So what's up?

194
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,836
We should really be sitting for this.

195
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,981
Sure we should.

196
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,357
I'm gonna ask once,
and I want a straight answer.

197
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:28,329
Not like when I asked if those red
pants made my ass look big.

198
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,902
I know things have been weird...

199
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,095
...but you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie...

200
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,934
...who's bitter because
she lost weight...

201
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,043
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

202
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,181
-Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
-Okay.

203
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,014
Will you be my maid of honor?

204
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,124
-Of course.
-That's so great.

205
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,120
It is. It is. It is.

206
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,261
-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all.

207
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,768
-What?
-That's not all.

208
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,431
-Oh, sure it is.
-Oh, no, it isn't.

209
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,671
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

210
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,072
What would make you think that?

211
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,318
Since the engagement,
he's acted weird.

212
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:26,388
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel.

213
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,484
Really?

214
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,897
If it'll make you feel any better...

215
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,566
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he was weird too.

216
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,067
Oh, God.
That's what I was afraid of.

217
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,899
What's what you were afraid of?

218
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,142
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and l...

219
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:52,181
... kind of had
a little thing on the side.

220
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,247
-What?
-I know, I know.

221
00:15:55,454 --> 00:16:00,517
When he proposed, people said, "He'll
do to you what he did to Rachel."

222
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,058
And now I feel so stupid.

223
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,832
You are so stupid.

224
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,428
We are both so stupid.

225
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,401
What do you mean?

226
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,840
Smell familiar?

227
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,613
Oh, I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,582
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.

229
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,810
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,458
Oh, my.

231
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,240
Four letters, "circle or hoop."

232
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,341
-Ring, damn it, ring.
-Thanks.

233
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,508
-You know our phone's not working?
-What?

234
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,846
I called and there was no answer.

235
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,647
I turned it off.

236
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,018
Mother of God, I turned it off.

237
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,389
Just like you told her you did.

238
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,598
Just pointing out the irony.

239
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,893
I went across the street
to the doorman.

240
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,104
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

241
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,038
Can I use your phone?

242
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,309
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.

243
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,776
"Heating device."

244
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,683
Radiator.

245
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,081
Five letters.

246
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,955
"Rdtor."

247
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,422
Yeah, is Sidney there?

248
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,495
Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.

249
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,327
So she's a woman, so what?

250
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,800
Yeah, so what?

251
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:57,165
I live across the street, and I know
about your telescope.

252
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,338
And I don't appreciate it.

253
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,341
Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?

254
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:07,684
If I wanna walk around in my
underwear, I shouldn't have to feel

255
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,547
Thank you.

256
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,220
That's not really the point.
The point is, that

257
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,521
Mostly free-weights,
but occasionally

258
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,026
Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.

259
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,267
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

260
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,998
The green dress? Really?

261
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,373
She said you looked like
lngrid Bergman.

262
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,881
Did she mention me?

263
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,523
She wants to know why you tie
the towel around your head.

264
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,257
It's a leave-in conditioner, okay?

265
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,691
It's a leave-in conditioner.

266
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,136
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.

267
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,432
Come on...

268
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,703
-...in.
-Hello, sweetheart.

269
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,341
What you guys doing here?

270
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,344
We are here to break up with you.

271
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,744
Both of you?

272
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:19,453
We think you're a horrible person,
and bad things should happen to you.

273
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,020
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

274
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,628
I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.

275
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:30,062
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

276
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,804
Which one of us
are you talking to there?

277
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,902
Mindy.

278
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,634
Of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.

279
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,379
When we were having sex
in that chair?

280
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,182
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was thinking of you.

281
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:52,880
Please. That second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.

282
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,820
You did it twice?

283
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,259
The first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.

284
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,729
Honey, sweetheart, look.
Just give me another chance.

285
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,769
We'll start over.
We'll go back to Aruba.

286
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:11,966
What is it with you and Aruba?
Do you have a deal with the airlines?

287
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,075
What do you say?

288
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,008
Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.

289
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,910
Jason Castalano 's choking
on his retainer.

290
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,983
Oh, God.
I'll be right there, Bernice.

291
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,315
Look, please don't go anywhere.

292
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,424
I'll be right back.

293
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,996
Okay, and we'll be here,
hating you.

294
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,925
See how he was sweating
when he walked out?

295
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,467
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...

296
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,299
...and take some punches.
This feels great.

297
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,201
I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

298
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,640
What are you talking about?

299
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,679
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

300
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,977
He is Satan in a smock.

301
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,621
I know he's not perfect.

302
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:06,287
But the truth is at the end of
the day, I still really wanna be...

303
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,796
... Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...

304
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,526
... D. D.S.

305
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,399
Oh, God.

306
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,472
I hope you can find a way
to be happy for me.

307
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:22,180
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

308
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,645
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

309
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,223
You okay?

310
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,225
Really?

311
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,394
Since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

312
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:47,003
...I've wondered whether I made
the right choice.

313
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,763
And now I know.

314
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,502
I'm so glad.

315
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,272
Big day.

316
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,990
I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

317
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,196
He's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat....

318
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,058
Did you know he's gay?

319
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:21,395
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

320
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,543
Danielle, hi.

321
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,907
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

322
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,841
Why are you here?

323
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,211
I've been calling,
but I had your number wrong.

324
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,718
When I got the right one,
there was no answer.

325
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:42,393
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.

326
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,652
I'm okay.

327
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,523
Maybe we could get together later?

328
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,366
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

329
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,798
You got it.

330
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,903
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye.

331
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,477
-There you go.
-Second date.

332
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,010
I don't know.

333
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,773
You don't know?

334
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:07,577
She seems nice, but her coming
all the way here...

335
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:12,415
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?

336
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:23,415

1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,730
Mother, just once,
can we go to lunch...

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:08,806
...and not talk about what I'm wearing
or where my career is going?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,170
Or who I'm dating.

4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,936
-Ready for the check?
-God, yes.

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,978
-I'll take it.
-No, darling.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:21,017
I said I'll take it.
Here, take it. Go. Run.

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,751
Very sweet.

8
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,118
-And on what they pay you
-Career.

9
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,288
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm doing fine.

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,523
I'm afraid this has been denied.

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,858
That's impossible.

12
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,368
That's all right, dear.
Here you go.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,903
The One With The Fake Monica

14
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,287
How'd someone get your card number?

15
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,858
No idea.
Look how much they spent.

16
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,792
You only have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

17
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,728
Still, it's just
such reckless spending.

18
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,868
When somebody steals...

19
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,004
...they've already thrown caution
to the wind.

20
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:54,012
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69. 95 on a Wonder Mop.

21
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,810
That's me.

22
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,912
You see, when I say geek, I mean

23
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,219
The hell with it, you bought
a $70 mop, you're a geek.

24
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:12,155
Oh, yuck. Ross, he's doing it again.

25
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,458
Marcel, stop humping the lamp.

26
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,330
Stop humping. Now, Marcel, come
Come here, Marcel.

27
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,336
Oh, no. Not in my room.
I'll get him.

28
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,032
You've got to do something about that.

29
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,303
What? It's just a phase.

30
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,306
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

31
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,177
You'd think you would be
more understanding.

32
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,287
I know. But we're not.

33
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,883
Would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

34
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,859
-Marcel, stop it. Marcel. Bad monkey.
-What?

35
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,822
Let's say my Curious George
is no longer curious.

36
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,109
You are not still
going over that thing.

37
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,076
-This woman's living my life.
-What?

38
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,151
She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.

39
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,381
Look at this. Look. She buys tickets
to plays I wanna see.

40
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,319
She shops where
I'm afraid of the salespeople.

41
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,328
-She spent $300 on art supplies.
-You're not an artist.

42
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,763
I might be if I had the supplies.

43
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,530
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

44
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,575
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

45
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,075
Really? Let's compare, shall we?

46
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,180
Oh, it's so late for "shall we."

47
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,478
Do I horseback ride in the park?

48
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,816
-Do I take classes at the New School?
-No.

49
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,359
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

50
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,834
-How about Joey Paponi?
-No, still too ethnic.

51
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:06,375
-My agent wants a more neutral name.
-Joey Switzerland?

52
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:17,016
Plus, I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm this big:

53
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,382
Which I'm not.

54
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,293
Joe, Joe, Joe Stalin?

55
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,394
Stalin.

56
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,128
Do I know that name?
It sounds familiar.

57
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,238
Well, it does not
ring a bell with me.

58
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:38,569
But you're more plugged
into that show business thing.

59
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,804
Joe Stalin.

60
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,948
You know, that's pretty good.

61
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,644
You might wanna try Joseph.

62
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:56,789
Joseph Stalin.

63
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,362
-I think you'd remember that.
-Yes.

64
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,796
Bye Bye Birdie,
starring Joseph Stalin.

65
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,474
Joseph Stalin is
the Fiddler on the Roof.

66
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,315
Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller.

67
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:29,962
I'm taking some classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

68
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,190
I've had a recent head injury
and certain numbers

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,100
Barbecue. Oh, did l?
See, there you go.

70
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,300
-What are you doing?
-All right, great.

71
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,446
Great. Thanks a lot.
I'm going to tap class.

72
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,776
To dance with the woman
that stole your card?

73
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,747
To see what she looks like.

74
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,615
I'm sure her picture's up
at the post office.

75
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,348
I should get to see who she is.

76
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:04,519
You're kind of losing it here.
This is becoming a weird obsession.

77
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,926
This is madness, I tell you.

78
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,159
For the love of God, Monica,
don't do it.

79
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,964
Thank you.

80
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,211
-What do you think?
-Lots of things.

81
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,151
-Which one is she?
-May I help you?

82
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,188
No, thanks. We're
just here to observe.

83
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,226
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class.

84
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,657
Spare shoes are over there.

85
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,328
What does she mean?

86
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:46,266
I think she means
"You dance a dance class."

87
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,407
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Really?

88
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,070
Do you see anybody
you think could be me?

89
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,976
Last time there were yogurt
containers lying around after class.

90
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:02,449
-Let's not have that happen again.
-She could be you.

91
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,420
Let's get started.

92
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,493
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.

93
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:22,436
-Okay, I'm not getting this.
-I'm totally getting it.

94
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:30,743
Do you ever feel like you're
so uncoordinated?

95
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,818
What? You click when they click.

96
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,153
All right, everyone grab a partner.

97
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:51,993
All right. And my dead mother
said you are it. I'm with Rachel.

98
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,099
Great, it's gym class all over again.

99
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:01,177
You can come up to the front
and dance with me.

100
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,940
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

101
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:15,285
It's okay, it's okay. I'm here,
I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

102
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,521
Okay, here I am.
So who's the new tense girl?

103
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,163
-She's your partner.
-Hi, I'm Monica.

104
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,802
Oh, Monica.

105
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,298
Hi, I'm Mon

106
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,341
-Nana.
-Monana.

107
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,781
-It's Dutch.
-You're kidding.

108
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,508
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

109
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,554
Pennsylvania Dutch.

110
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:51,220
And we're dancing.
Five, six, seven, eight.

111
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,399
Hi.

112
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,275
-Hey. Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.

113
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,347
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cone?

114
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,144
She says Marcel's humping
is not a phase.

115
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,619
Apparently, he's reached
sexual maturity.

116
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,619
Hey, he beat you.

117
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:31,463
She says, as time goes on,
he's gonna start getting violent.

118
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,102
So, what does this mean?

119
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,968
I have to give him up.

120
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,492
I can't believe it. This sucks.

121
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:58,152
You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

122
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,525
I know. One day he's
this little thing...

123
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:06,899
...and then he's this little thing
I can't get off my leg.

124
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,242
Isn't there any way to keep him?

125
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,345
No. The vet said
unless he's in a place...

126
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,014
...where he has regular access...

127
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,978
...to some monkey loving...

128
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,080
... he's just gonna get vicious.

129
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,018
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

130
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,863
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know.

131
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,136
No, that's popes into a Vokswagen.

132
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,708
We're applying to a lot. Our first
choice would be a big state zoo.

133
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,778
You know, like San Diego. Right?

134
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,710
But that may just be a pipe dream.
He's out-of-state.

135
00:10:55,955 --> 00:11:00,289
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

136
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:05,259
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

137
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,263
We found the girl.

138
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,406
-Did you call the cops?
-We took her to lunch.

139
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,305
Oh, your own brand
of vigilante justice.

140
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,775
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you.

141
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,416
She stole. She's a stealer.

142
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:30,879
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget that.

143
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:36,123
I mean, she's this astounding person
with this amazing spirit.

144
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,491
Which she probably stole
from some cheerleader.

145
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,268
-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a Vokswagen.

146
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,403
I love that joke.

147
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,811
-No way. No way did you do this.
-Monana was very brave.

148
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,745
We told them we were
the Gundersons in room 61 5...

149
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:07,085
...only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire floor.

150
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,729
When they saw that we're short
and have breasts....

151
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,628
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel. Me.

152
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,132
Go, Monana.

153
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,866
You ladies are not the only ones
living the dream.

154
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:27,875
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

155
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,310
Oh, by the way...

156
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:35,348
...tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

157
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,189
-Excuse me?
-There's an open call for Cats.

158
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,121
I'm thinking we sing "Memories"...

159
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,661
...and make complete fools
of ourselves. What do you say?

160
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:51,166
No, no, no. Remember who you're
dealing with here.

161
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,601
I can't even stand in front
of a tap class.

162
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,970
That's because
of your Amish background.

163
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,008
-What?
-You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

164
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:06,674
Right. Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.

165
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:14,250
I was just like you. And then, one day,
I saw a movie that changed my life.

166
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,318
Did you ever see
Dead Poets Society?

167
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,331
I thought that movie was
so incredibly boring.

168
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,695
That thing at the end where the kid...

169
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,930
...kills himself
because he can't be in the play?

170
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:36,172
It's like, "Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater."

171
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:43,418
I thought, "That's two hours of
my life that I'm never getting back."

172
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:48,116
That scared me more than all
the other crap I was afraid to do.

173
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:52,627
Wow. Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

174
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,473
Oh, God.

175
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,905
We didn't get into Scranton.

176
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,812
That was, like, our safety zoo.

177
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,879
They take, like, dogs and cows.

178
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:20,886
See, I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

179
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,686
I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.

180
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,127
Marcel. Marcel. Marcel, no.

181
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,571
Good boy. See?
How can nobody want him?

182
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,672
Somebody will.

183
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,341
You know, there already
is a Joseph Stalin.

184
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,953
You're kidding.

185
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:56,856
Apparently, he was this Russian
dictator who slaughtered people.

186
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:01,723
-You'd think you would've known that.
-You'd think I would've.

187
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,528
Hey, how about Joey Heatherton?

188
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:10,539
Come on, I told you
I don't wanna go back to Joey.

189
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,638
What do you think a good
stage name for me would be?

190
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,916
Flame Boy.

191
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,289
Where exactly is your zoo?

192
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,158
Well, it's technically
not a zoo, per se.

193
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,495
It's more of an interactive
wildlife experience.

194
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,797
Let me ask you some questions
about Marcel.

195
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:47,436
-Does he fight with other animals?
-No, no. He's very docile.

196
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,080
Even if he were cornered?

197
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,550
Well, I don't know. Why?

198
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,847
How is he at handling small objects?

199
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,619
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

200
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,962
What about a hammer or a small blade?

201
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,369
Why would he need a blade?

202
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,439
If he's up against
an animal with horns...

203
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,974
...you got to give him something.

204
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,408
Otherwise, it's just cruel.

205
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,582
-He got into San Diego.
-What?

206
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,244
We came back from our walk.
The phone was ringing....

207
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,481
He's in.

208
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:38,027
Did you hear that, Marcel?
San Diego. San Diego.

209
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,222
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's good...

210
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,925
... but I'll start him off
against a blind rabbit...

211
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,901
...and give you 20% of the gate.

212
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,691
Where have you been?

213
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:13,058
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

214
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,091
I think I kissed an archbishop.

215
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,338
But, of course,
it could've been a chef.

216
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,975
-Are you drunk?
-No.

217
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:36,449
-I'm lying. I am so drunk.
-Oh, God.

218
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,055
You know what?
You could've called.

219
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,227
I've been worried Monica.

220
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,000
Water rules.

221
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,103
Yes. Yes, it does.

222
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,468
The restaurant called. They wanna
know if you're showing up for work.

223
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,779
Nope. Going to
the Big Apple Circus today.

224
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,017
You're gonna lose your job.
This is not you.

225
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,812
No, it is me.

226
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,321
I'm not just the person
who fluffs the pillows...

227
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,787
...and pays the bills right away.

228
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:20,988
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that.

229
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm Monana.

230
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:36,111
Hello? Yes, she is.
Hold on a second please.

231
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:41,045
Monana, it's for you.
The credit card people.

232
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,481
Hello.

233
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,789
Yes?

234
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,492
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,262
-Thanks.
-What?

236
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,895
They've arrested Monica.

237
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,475
-Hi.
-Hi.

238
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,309
How are you?

239
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:16,045
Not too bad.
Fortunately, blue's my color.

240
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,581
How did you know I was here?

241
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:24,420
Because I'm Monica Geller.

242
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,655
It was my credit card you were using.

243
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,330
That I was not expecting.

244
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,994
I want you to know,
I didn't turn you in.

245
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,868
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

246
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,540
You have given me so much.

247
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,976
I'd never have gotten to sing...

248
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,844
... "Memories" at
the Winter Garden Theater.

249
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,214
Actually, you only got
to sing "Memo"

250
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:54,458
I can't believe you're here.
What will I do without you?

251
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,127
Who's gonna crash
parties with me?

252
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,195
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

253
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:04,529
I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women...

254
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:09,001
...and you're worried about who'll
take you to the circus?

255
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,972
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

256
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,670
There's nothing to wonder about.

257
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,909
You'll go back to being who you were.
That's who you are.

258
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,553
-Not necessarily.
-Yes, necessarily.

259
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:27,589
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

260
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:36,701
-I'm not actually Amish.
-Really? Then why are you like that?

261
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,449
-You, by the door, in or out?
-ln.

262
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,024
-You're getting it all wrong.
-But at least I'm doing it.

263
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,478
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 67...

264
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,944
... to San Diego at gate 42A.

265
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:32,919
Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.
All right, I wrote you this poem.

266
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,253
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

267
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,929
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

268
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,732
Okay, bye, champ.

269
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,837
There'll be a lot
of babes in San Diego...

270
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,635
... but remember,
there's also a lot to learn.

271
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,908
I don't know what to say, Ross.
It's a monkey.

272
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,555
Just say what you feel, Joey.

273
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,048
-Marcel, I'm hungry.
-That was good.

274
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,855
Marcel, this is for you.

275
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:19,527
It's just, you know, something...

276
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,036
...to do on the plane.

277
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,441
If you don't mind,
I'd like a moment alone.

278
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,638
-Oh, sure. Absolutely.
-Go ahead.

279
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:40,081
Marcel, come here. Come here.
Come here.

280
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,260
Well, buddy...

281
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,656
...this is it.

282
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,924
Just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

283
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,898
I'm really gonna miss you.

284
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,938
You know, I'm never gonna
forget about you.

285
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:01,044
You've been more than
just a pet to me.

286
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,875
You've been more like a
Okay. Marcel.

287
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,882
Would you leave my leg alone?

288
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,180
Would you stop humping me
for two seconds?

289
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,759
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

290
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,382
Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand...

291
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,022
...that I might touch thy cheek.

292
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:50,251
-That's fine. Thank you.
-Next.

293
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,495
I'll be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

294
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,795
-Name?
-Holden McGroin.

00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,763
-Tell him.
-Tell him.

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,130
-Shut up.
-Tell me what?

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,771
You won't look at him.

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,875
I could use another
reason why women won't look at me.

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:15,604
All right. All right.
Last night, I had a dream...

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:18,248
...that you and I were

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,249
Doing it on this table.

8
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,285
Excellent dream score.

9
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,930
Why would you dream that?

10
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,830
More importantly...

11
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,329
...was I any good?

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,432
Well, you were pretty damn good.

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:44,233
Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

14
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:49,374
Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

15
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,650
I love it when we share.

16
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,818
You okay?

17
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:03,484
I can't believe you two
had sex in her dream.

18
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,731
Sorry, it was a one-time thing.

19
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:10,369
I was very drunk, and it was
someone else's subconscious.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,168
The One With The lck Factor

21
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,613
Hello, Rachel.

22
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,653
Get off.

23
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,659
Ooh, give me. Can you see me
operating a drill press?

24
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,657
I don't know.
What are you wearing?

25
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:18,497
Why would you want to?

26
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:22,664
For short-term work. Till I get
back my massage clients.

27
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,468
Pirates again?

28
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,545
No. Nothing like that.

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,941
I'm just such a dummy.

30
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:35,314
I taught a "Massage Yourself at Home"
workshop. And they are.

31
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,920
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

32
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,627
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

33
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,828
I could. I could do it. What is it?

34
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:50,229
My secretary's gonna be out.
She's having one of her boobs reduced.

35
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,165
It's a whole big boob story.

36
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,833
-I could be a secretary.
-I don't know if it'd be your thing...

37
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:02,947
... because it involves being
normal for a large portion of the day.

38
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,078
I could do that.

39
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,780
-What's that?
-My new beeper.

40
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,456
Why does a paleontologist
need a beeper?

41
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:16,788
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?
Help. They're still extinct.

42
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,755
It's for when Carol goes into labor.

43
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,629
All she has to do is dial 55-JlMBO.

44
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,929
A cool number and
a possible name for the kid.

45
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,804
-See you later.
-Off to see young Ethan?

46
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,677
Thank you.

47
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,175
How young is young Ethan?
Young?

48
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,346
He's our age.

49
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,178
When we were....

50
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,019
-He's a senior in college.
-College?

51
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,663
Rob that cradle.

52
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,261
He's smart and mature and grown-up.

53
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,872
Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.

54
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,471
This man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

55
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,039
No, of course not.
It's not even an issue...

56
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,975
... because I said I was 22.

57
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,480
-You what?
-What?

58
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:15,176
-Oh, I can't pass for 22?
-Well, maybe 25, 26.

59
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,150
-I am 26.
-There you go.

60
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,767
Can you hear that?

61
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,067
That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.

62
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,948
-Oh, I'm on.
-Okay.

63
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,781
Mr. Bing's office.

64
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,849
-Sorry, he's in a meeting.
-I'm not in a meeting.

65
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,823
Will he know what
this is in reference to?

66
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,622
And he has your number?

67
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,528
I'll see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye.

68
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,072
Ross says hi.

69
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,302
This is so fun.
What do we do now?

70
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,343
Well, now I actually
have to get to work.

71
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,240
"Most likely."

72
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,413
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

73
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,588
All right. Bye-bye.

74
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,256
Bye-bye.

75
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,797
-Yes?
-What you doing?

76
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,404
Okay, windows are clean.
Candles are lit.

77
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,938
BeIt's too tight.
Gotta change.

78
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,306
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

79
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,146
-Am I out of control?
-Just a touch.

80
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,484
I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since...

81
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,781
... his midterms.

82
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,953
Why, all of a sudden,
are you so...?

83
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:09,494
-What?
-Could tonight be the night?

84
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,005
I don't know. He's a great guy...

85
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,505
...and I love being with him.
But, you know...

86
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,347
...things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.

87
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,912
-So, did you shave your legs?
-Yeah.

88
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,981
Would you let it go?
It was just a dream.

89
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,682
It doesn't mean

90
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,027
This is it. It's baby time!

91
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,823
All right, relax. Just relax.
Be cool.

92
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,867
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

93
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,134
No, Andre is not here.
Third time today.

94
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,204
Yes, I am sure.

95
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,782
I do not perform
those kind of services.

96
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,475
Services?

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,880
Oh, services.

98
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,716
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

99
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,162
That's right.

100
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,390
That's right.
JUMBO with a "U," sir.

101
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,124
You don't want me.

102
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,304
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

103
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,933
Alrighty, bye-bye.

104
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,577
How was the first day?

105
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,148
Excellent.
Everyone was so, so nice.

106
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,185
It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

107
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,754
Me.

108
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,816
-I didn't tell anyone I knew you.
-Why?

109
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,825
Well, because, you know.

110
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,322
They don't like you.

111
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,162
-What?
-I thought you knew.

112
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,234
-Who doesn't like me?
-Everyone.

113
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,103
Except for....

114
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,937
No. Everyone.

115
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,776
-What are you talking about?
-Don't feel bad.

116
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,250
They used to like you a lot.

117
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:15,223
But you got promoted, and now you're
Mr. Boss Man. Mr. Big.

118
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:18,055
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

119
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,135
-I can't believe it.
-Yeah. They even do you.

120
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,672
They "do" me?

121
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,533
You know, like, okay:

122
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,707
"Could that report be any later?"

123
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,214
-I don't sound like that.
-Yeah, you do.

124
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,888
"The hills are alive
with the sound...

125
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,189
...of music."

126
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,690
"My scone. My scone."

127
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,238
I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.

128
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,344
That is so not
That is so not

129
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,670
That
Oh, shut up.

130
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,978
-Did not.
-Up until I was 9...

131
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,745
... I thought "gunpoint" was
a place where crimes happened.

132
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,983
-How's that possible?
-It's always on the news.

133
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:23,787
"A man is being held up at Gunpoint."

134
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,294
"Tourists are terrorized
at Gunpoint."

135
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,236
And I kept thinking,
"Why do people continue to go there?"

136
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,871
I should go.

137
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,643
-Unless
-What?

138
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,982
Unless you wanna stay over.

139
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,852
I mean, I'm going to. So....

140
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,823
Yeah, I'd really like that.

141
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,371
Before we get into any
staying-over stuff...

142
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,078
...there's something you should know.

143
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,544
Is this, like,
"I have an early class tomorrow"...

144
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,410
...or "I'm secretly married
to a goat"?

145
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,547
Well, it's somewhere in between.

146
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,954
You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not....

147
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,061
Well, I mean, I haven't ever....

148
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,594
Ethan?

149
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,563
Are you a virgin?

150
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:39,030
If that's what you kids are
calling it these days, then...

151
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,500
...yes, I am.

152
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:48,175
I mean, you're just such a good kisser
I would never have known.

153
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:53,114
Well, I've excelled at every level
I've been to, I just....

154
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:59,190
I just haven't been to
that particular one yet.

155
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,954
I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.

156
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,688
-Really?
-Yeah.

157
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,327
You do know I was talking
about you, right?

158
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,644
Wow.

159
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,304
You keep saying that.

160
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,352
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

161
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:31,181
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...

162
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,150
...it is nothing like that.

163
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,591
Listen, listen.

164
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,932
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.

165
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,267
And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.

166
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,807
Don't tell me I did it wrong.

167
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,106
Nothing wrong about that.

168
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,051
Here goes.

169
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,456
I'm not 22.

170
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,357
I'm 25...

171
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,993
...and 1 3 months.

172
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,594
But I figure that shouldn't
change anything.

173
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:22,740
What does it matter how old we are?
Basically, I'm nuts about you.

174
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:27,879
I knew after the first time we kissed.
You didn't mention the Tic Tac.

175
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,140
I just thought
you were naturally minty.

176
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,949
Listen...

177
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,818
...as long as we're
telling stuff...

178
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,953
... I have another one for you.

179
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,927
I'm a little younger than I said.

180
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,762
-You're not a senior?
-Oh, I'm a senior...

181
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,800
...in high school.

182
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,419
What we did was wrong.

183
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:15,822
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

184
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,355
I just had sex.

185
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,068
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?

186
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,900
-You never said your age.
-It's different.

187
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,340
My lie didn't make one of us
a felon in 48 states.

188
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,074
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy falling

189
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,650
-Don't say it.
-ln love with you.

190
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,454
-Really?
-Sorry.

191
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,614
Well, fall out of it.

192
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,351
You shouldn't be here.
It's a school night.

193
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,129
Oh, God.

194
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,630
I'm like those women
that you see...

195
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,303
...with shiny guys named Chad.

196
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,738
I'm Joan Collins.

197
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,136
Who?

198
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,556
Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

199
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,464
Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.

200
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,192
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

201
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,404
It's just easier that way.

202
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:40,472
-You told me about the last dream.
-No. Forget it.

203
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,638
Why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?

204
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,286
All right. Fine.

205
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,014
You were not the only one there.

206
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,683
Joey was there too.

207
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,762
All right.

208
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,590
Was there...

209
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,602
...anybody else there?

210
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,266
You sure? Nobody...

211
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,139
... handing out mints or anything?

212
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,913
No, it was just the three of us.

213
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,515
So was it you and Chandler...

214
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,224
...then you and me,
or you, me and Chandler?

215
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,686
-You know what?
-What?

216
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,360
There were times...

217
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,861
...when it wasn't even me.

218
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,843
That is so sweet, you guys.

219
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,179
Mon, Ethan called again.

220
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,027
-What?
-Ethan called again.

221
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,524
-You're not seeing him anymore?
-No.

222
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,099
Sometimes, things don't work out.

223
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:17,705
This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?

224
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,705
I did not say anything. I swear.

225
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,816
-He stopped by.
-Next time you talk to him...

226
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,183
...could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

227
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,958
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

228
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,390
Sorry.

229
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,497
"It's morphin'time."

230
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,566
-Stegosaurus.
-Tyrannosaurus.

231
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,305
I gotta go.

232
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,972
Head rush.

233
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,841
One more, and then I have to go.

234
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,378
Cool.

235
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,614
Where you going?

236
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,449
A birthday party
with some work people.

237
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:09,320
Work people? Nobody told me.

238
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,825
I know.
That's part of the whole...

239
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,294
...them-not-liking-you
extravaganza.

240
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,694
A month ago,
these people were my friends.

241
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,964
I'm in charge,
but I'm not a different person.

242
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:28,143
Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

243
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,508
-You think I should?
-I really do.

244
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,212
But could we not go together?

245
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,515
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.

246
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,090
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.

247
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:50,928
-This can't be easy for him either.
-I know.

248
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,266
This may take some time
for him to get over it...

249
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:59,171
... but, then at four,
Muppet Babies is on.

250
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,543
Go deep. Deep. Deep.

251
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,723
Sorry, Shelly.

252
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,827
See, with the fun?

253
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,853
Last night was great.

254
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,796
The karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and lvory."

255
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,335
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.

256
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,235
-What?
-Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

257
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,033
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

258
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,008
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy
Boss Man Bing.

259
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,906
Then I don't get it.

260
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,617
You know what?
I think you just gotta face it.

261
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,255
You're the guy in the big office.

262
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,358
You're the one that hires
and fires them.

263
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,256
-They say you're a great boss.
-They do?

264
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,966
But they're not
your friends anymore.

265
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,930
-I just want
-But you can't.

266
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,331
But I just want

267
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,173
Are you gonna?

268
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,149
Carol and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1...

269
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,755
...she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

270
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,219
What about Andre?

271
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,485
He got a call
from our cousin, Nathan.

272
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,631
Frankly, it was a little more
than I needed to know.

273
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,675
That was gonna be my opener.

274
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,944
Have you guys seen those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

275
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,446
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.

276
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,317
Look, I gotta tell you something.

277
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,357
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was vulnerable.

278
00:19:55,594 --> 00:20:00,031
I'm actually 30. I have a wife
and a job. I'm your congressman.

279
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,028
This is ridiculous.
We're great together.

280
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:08,171
We can talk, make each other
laugh, and the sex....

281
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:12,309
I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.

282
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,480
-lt was.
-Then what's the problem?

283
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,006
Ethan, it's....

284
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,950
It's icky.

285
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,719
"lcky"?

286
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:29,485
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's "icky"?

287
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,756
This isn't easy for me either.
I wish things were different.

288
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,592
If you were older
or I was younger...

289
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:40,293
...or we lived in biblical times...

290
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,065
-... I could really
-No, don't say it.

291
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,140
Love you.

292
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,314
-Are your hands still wet?
-Moist.

293
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,450
Let's dry them again.

294
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,057
Or, like, "Could these margaritas
be any stronger?"

295
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,090
Hey, Chandler.

296
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,696
Hello, Mr. Bing.

297
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,232
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

298
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:17,268
Thanks. About the weekly numbers, I'm
gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.

299
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,376
-Sure.
-No problem.

300
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,507
You have to give them something.

301
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,981
That was Gerston, Santos, and
who's the other guy?

302
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,086
-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, okay.

303
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,950
Well, some people
are gonna be working...

304
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,524
...this weekend.

305
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,282
Oh, that's nice.

306
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,031
Ross.

307
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,540
I'm here.

308
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,712
You are?

309
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,883
We were just....

310
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,315
What?

311
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,225
-Great. Now I'm having a baby.
-What?

312
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,828
I'm having a baby. I'm having a

313
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,162
-The phone, the phone.
-I don't have the phone.

314
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,403
I'm hurt.

315
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,781
Let's go.
Come on, people. Woman in labor.

316
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,685
-Look what I got going.
-Save it for the cab.

317
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,787
We're going to a hospital.

318
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,188
I can't look nice?
There are doctors there.

319
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,556
-Joey, get out of the fridge.
-All right.

320
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,300
-What is that?
-For the ride.

321
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,196
-Like in a cab
-Save it.

322
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,497
-Hating this.
-Monica, come on. Let's go.

323
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:28,695
Baby coming.

324
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,398
I can't believe I'm gonna be
an aunt.

325
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:35,077
-I'll have a nephew.
-That's nice. Get out.

326
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,881
All right, I'm going.
I'm going.

327
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,118
Here we go. Come on.

1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:10,204
She's having my baby,
and she's not here yet.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,277
-Has her water broken yet?
-I don't know.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,882
When we talked, she said she'd
already passed the mucous plug.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,113
Do we have to know about that?

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,055
What'll you do
when you have a baby?

6
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,659
I'll be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,831
Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

8
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,928
She could be giving birth in the cab.

9
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,471
Relax. It's only $2
for the first contraction...

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,939
...and then 50 cents for each
additional contraction.

11
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,513
What, it's okay
when Chandler does it?

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,378
You have to pick your moments.

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,217
Did I miss it?

14
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,288
-She's not here yet.
-What's with the guitar?

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,551
We might be here for a while.
Things might get musical.

16
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,555
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

17
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,062
I got this,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

18
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:12,465
You're having a baby.
You don't stop for Chunkies.

19
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,605
I used to have that bumper sticker.

20
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,472
You see what I mean?

21
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,242
The One With the Birth

22
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,893
-"Stopped for a Chunky."
-Let it go, Ross.

23
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,120
I got an extra one.
You want this?

24
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,832
-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. Franzblau.

25
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,007
I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

26
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,144
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,805
-How are your contractions?
-I love them.

28
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,452
Each one's like a little party
in my uterus.

29
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,919
-Every 4 minutes, lasting 55 seconds.
-59 seconds. Quartz.

30
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,119
Swiss quartz.

31
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,420
-Am I allowed to drink anything?
-lce chips.

32
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,157
-At the nurse's station.
-I'll get it!

33
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,132
-No, I'll get it.
-No, I'm getting it.

34
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,739
Hi. Thought you might like
some ice chips.

35
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,539
-Thanks.
-And if you need anything else l...

36
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,611
...do not believe we've met.

37
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,582
I'm Rachel Greene.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:08,082
I'm Carol's ex-husband's
sister's roommate.

39
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,022
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Franzblau.

40
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:16,058
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

41
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,188
Oh, that's funny.

42
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,099
I want a baby.

43
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,743
Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

44
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,711
-Get up. Let's get some coffee.
-Okay, because we never do that.

45
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,216
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Or just fall down. That's good too.

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,382
Knick fan?

47
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,856
-Oh, boy, do they suck.
-Listen, lady

48
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,761
Look. Look at your man, Ewing.

49
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,332
He couldn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

50
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,136
-And who do you like?
-Celtics.

51
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,569
Celtics? They couldn't hit a boat if

52
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,639
Wait....

53
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,737
They suck, all right?

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,446
Shut up.
It's a rebuilding year

55
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,947
Let me get the father.
We need a father over here.

56
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,019
There's no father.

57
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,921
-Oh, sorry.
-That's okay. I'm fine.

58
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,360
Okay. Right this way.

59
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,433
All the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

60
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,137
They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,043
But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

62
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:50,012
Now they're yelling at you
And you don 't know why

63
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:54,159
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,523
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

65
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,063
-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

66
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:07,305
Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

67
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,700
No fair.

68
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,673
I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

69
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,507
-You'll get one.
-When?

70
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:20,685
Tell you what. When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

71
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,787
...what do you say we have one?

72
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,049
Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

73
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,159
I just meant hypothetically.

74
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:32,422
Hypothetically, why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

75
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:37,426
What is it? Is there something
unmarriable about me?

76
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,761
Well?

77
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,099
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack.

78
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,877
Look at you, dressy-dress.

79
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,910
Did you go home and change?

80
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,814
It's an important day.
I want to look nice.

81
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,281
Has Dr. Franzblau been by?

82
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,020
I haven't seen him.

83
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,956
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

84
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,299
What if the baby needs him?

85
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,971
What's the deal with you and doctors?
Is your father a doctor?

86
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,434
Yeah. Why?

87
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,175
No reason.

88
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,141
Mom, we've been through this.

89
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,907
No, I am not calling him.

90
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,311
I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk.

91
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,081
No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.

92
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,820
What do you mean "Joey who"?

93
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,253
Joey who?

94
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,588
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

95
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,625
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

96
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,929
She wants to talk to you.

97
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,996
Take the phone.

98
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,674
Yeah, it's me.

99
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,504
No, we're just friends.

100
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,940
Yeah, I'm single.

101
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,046
Twenty-five.

102
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,711
An actor. Hello?

103
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,218
She's not much of a phone person.

104
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,126
So, what's the deal
with this father guy?

105
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,235
If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

106
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,532
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? No.

107
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,339
-Maybe I should just go.
-Maybe you should.

108
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,209
Good luck...

109
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,116
...and take care.

110
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,723
The Celtics problem is that
the players run the team.

111
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,091
-That is so not true.
-Oh, it is.

112
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,164
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

113
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,597
You're gonna kill me.

114
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:56,268
-Fifteen more seconds. 1 4, 1 3, 1 2
-Count faster.

115
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,412
It'll be okay. IKeep focusing on Jordy.
He'll be here soon.

116
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:04,913
-Three. Two. Who the hell is Jordy?
-Your son.

117
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:09,144
I don't have a son named Jordy.
We all agreed on Jamie.

118
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,449
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend...

119
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,649
...so we went back to Jordy.

120
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:19,191
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never landed on Jordy.

121
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:24,062
We just passed by it during the whole
Jesse-Cody-Dillon fiasco.

122
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,902
Ow! Leg cramp!

123
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,505
-I got it.
-I got it. I'm doing it.

124
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,041
You get to sleep with her.
I get the cramps.

125
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:33,337
No, you don't.

126
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,810
That is it.
I want both of you out.

127
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,505
-She started it.
-He did.

128
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,982
I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here...

129
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,180
...and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

130
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,091
-Thanks.
-See what you did?

131
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,296
-Listen
-Out!

132
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,823
Breathe. Breathe.

133
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,606
What is that? Something exploded.

134
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,170
-That's not the baby, is it?
-Her water broke. Calm down.

135
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,648
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

136
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,786
Breathe. Breathe.

137
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,759
I'm okay. I'm okay.
That's disgusting. I'm okay.

138
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,928
-This is so your fault.
-How is this my fault?

139
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,500
Carol never threw me out
of a room before you.

140
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,297
There's a lot of things
Carol never did before me.

141
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,275
-Are you trying to be clever?
-You're so threatened by me.

142
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:43,574
Hey. Okay, all right.
That's it. Get in here.

143
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,184
My God, you guys.
I don't believe you.

144
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,479
There are children
coming into the world here...

145
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,248
...and your fighting isn't
the first thing they should hear.

146
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,961
So stop all the yelling!
Just stop it!

147
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:04,495
Don't make me do this again!
I don't like my voice like this!

148
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,905
Who wants to hear something ironic?

149
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,074
Are they here yet?

150
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,649
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

151
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,254
And until we do,
we are all here for you. Okay?

152
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,226
You were telling me
about Paris. It sounds wonderful.

153
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:34,024
There was this great little
pastry shop right by my hotel

154
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,394
There you go, dear.

155
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:41,065
-You find them?
-Not in the gift shop or cafeteria....

156
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,468
Where are Phoebe and Joey?

157
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,806
There's something sinister
going on here.

158
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,779
If you find anyone,
or parts of anyone...

159
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:55,147
...scream. And scream again.

160
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,719
-Help!
-Come on!

161
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,521
-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!

162
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,130
Okay, everyone stand back.

163
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,627
Ow.

164
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,968
All right, good thing
we're in a hospital.

165
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,801
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.

166
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,912
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.

167
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,611
Push him out, push him out.
Way out.

168
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,684
Let's get that ball and really move.

169
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,878
Let's get

170
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,686
I was just Yeah, okay.
Push, push, push.

171
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,425
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

172
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,564
Help! Help!

173
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,566
And they found their bodies
The very next day

174
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,769
And they found their bodies
The very next

175
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,745
Mom, everything's going fine.

176
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,477
Ross is great.

177
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,414
He's in a whole other place.

178
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,484
No, he's gone.

179
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,291
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

180
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:17,093
What do you mean "This might be your
only chance"? I'm only 26.

181
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,794
I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

182
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,282
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

183
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,290
Mazel tov.

184
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,830
It could be one hour or three.

185
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,260
But relax.
She's doing great.

186
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:53,063
So tell me, are you currently
involved with anyone?

187
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,431
Not at the moment, I'm not. Are you?

188
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,976
No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

189
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,046
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

190
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:10,616
No, really. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

191
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,551
...where I do.

192
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,021
I try not to let work
affect my personal life.

193
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,793
But it's hard when, when you do
what I do. It's, like....

194
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,537
Well, for instance,
what do you do?

195
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,172
I'm a waitress.

196
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:34,142
Aren't there times when you come home
at night and you're, like:

197
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:38,248
"If I see one more cup of coffee...."

198
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,817
Gotcha.

199
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:49,354
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

200
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,538
-How'd you know I was here?
-Your mom called me.

201
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,941
So is this her?

202
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,407
No, this is a loaner.

203
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,615
Ours is at the shop.

204
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,614
God, I hope she has my brains.

205
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,021
I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourself.

206
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:23,494
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,
a nurse and a helper guy.

207
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:30,294
-So did you see who won the game?
-The Knicks by 10. They suck.

208
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,305
They're not so bad.

209
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,093
Come on. Come on.

210
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:03,928
-You're doing it too hard.
-You have to do it hard or else

211
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,898
Damn it. Damn it.

212
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,537
Damn it, damn it.
This is all your fault.

213
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,232
This should be
the greatest day of my life.

214
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,034
My son is being born,
and I should be in there.

215
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,544
Instead, I'm stuck
in a closet with you.

216
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,012
I have been waiting for this
as much as you.

217
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,382
No one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

218
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,886
You know what's funny?

219
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,684
You go home with the baby.
Where does that leave me?

220
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,327
You're his father.

221
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,431
Who am l? There's Father's Day.
There's Mother's Day.

222
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,931
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

223
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,670
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

224
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:45,272
This is so great.

225
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,508
Do you wanna explain that?

226
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,810
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad left...

227
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,850
...and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jail.

228
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,718
I barely had enough pieces
to make one whole parent.

229
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,526
And here's this baby who has
three whole parents...

230
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,633
...who fight over
who gets to love it the most...

231
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,961
...and it's not even born yet.

232
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,100
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

233
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,108
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

234
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,505
Where are they?

235
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,582
-They'll be here.
-They wouldn't miss this.

236
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:32,155
Relax. You're only at 9 centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

237
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,094
You are really frightening me.

238
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,725
Somebody wanna help me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

239
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,429
That's great.
Anybody seen a nipple?

240
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,868
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

241
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,341
-Time to start pushing.
-But they're not here yet.

242
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:59,006
-I can't tell the baby to wait.
-Oh, God.

243
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,391
-Okay, got the vent open.
-Hi, I'm Ben.

244
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,557
I'm hospital worker Ben.

245
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,891
It's Ben to the rescue.

246
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,635
Ben, you ready? Give me your foot.

247
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,773
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

248
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,402
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

249
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,846
What do you see?

250
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,942
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

251
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,345
Wait.

252
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,646
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

253
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,458
Pheebs, it's open.
It's open.

254
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,630
Wait. You forgot your legs.

255
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,599
-Push. Push.
-We're here. We're here.

256
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,567
Where have you been?

257
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,601
Long story.

258
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:04,272
I need you to keep pushing.
I need Excuse me, can I have this?

259
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,346
There's too many people here.
There's about to be one more.

260
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:14,558
So if you're not an ex-husband or
lesbian life partner, out you go.

261
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,291
-Bye-bye.
-Good luck, you guys.

262
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:22,297
Do you have to be
Carol's lesbian life partner?

263
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,796
Out.

264
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,330
Here he comes.

265
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,371
Let me see. I've gotta see.

266
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,007
A head.

267
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,082
It's huge.
How are you doing this?

268
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,376
You're not helping.

269
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,419
You're doing great.

270
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,556
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry.

271
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,783
What do you see?
What do you see?

272
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:54,455
We got a head. We got arms.
Oh, look at the little fingers.

273
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,630
A chest and a stomach...

274
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:00,430
...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

275
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,800
Legs, knees and feet.

276
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,241
He's here.

277
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,876
He's a person.

278
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,447
-Look.
-What does he look like?

279
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,455
IKind of like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

280
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,725
Really?

281
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,492
You guys, he's beautiful.

282
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,391
Thanks, Pheebs.

283
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:38,167
No shouting, but we still need
a name for this little guy.

284
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:43,172
-How about Ben?
-I like Ben.

285
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,077
Ben.

286
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,622
Ben's good. How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

287
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,552
We just cooked it up.

288
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,687
That's what we were off doing.

289
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,291
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on.

290
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,304
I know. I know.

291
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,777
Everybody, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

292
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,310
-This is Ben.
-Hi, Ben.

293
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,417
Ben, this is everybody.

294
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,982
Susan, he looks just like you.

295
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,988
Thanks.

296
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,929
I can't believe one of us
actually has one of these.

297
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,600
I know.
I still am one of these.

298
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,834
Can l?

299
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,768
Okay, the head. You gotta....

300
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,951
I'm your Aunt Monica.
Yes, I am.

301
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,215
I'm your Aunt Monica.

302
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,695
I will always have gum.

303
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,597
Ben...

304
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,972
... I want you to know that
there may be some times when...

305
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,940
... I may not be around like this.

306
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,378
But I'll still always come back...

307
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,284
...Iike this.

308
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,120
And sometimes,
I may be away longer...

309
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,757
...Iike this.

310
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,227
But I'll still always come back...

311
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,499
...Iike this.

312
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:54,044
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal
third and I'll go like this:

313
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,319
He is so amazing.

314
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,183
Yeah, I know. Look at him.

315
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:16,000
Nothing.
I don't think that's his name.

316
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,130
Look, he's closing his eyes.

317
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,467
Look, he's opening his eyes.

318
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,835
He doesn't do much, does he?

319
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,777
Nope, this is pretty much it.

320
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,048
You guys wanna get some coffee?

321
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,319
I'll see you guys later.

322
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,226
He's closing his eyes again.

1
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:08,603
Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:13,438
A little bit later. Is he gonna sleep?

3
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:18,481
Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna?

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,515
Yep, out like a light!

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,346
This sure trumps
the "Has he pooped?" series.

6
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,389
Ross, we love him, okay?

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,654
But right now he's just
a little fat guy.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,388
How excited can we get?

9
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,960
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.

10
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,163
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!

11
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,637
The One Where Rachel Finds Out

12
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,018
Here's little Ben nodding off.

13
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,953
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,925
-Look, he's got Ross haircut.
-Let me see.

15
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,390
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,898
You must just wanna kiss him all over.

17
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,940
That would be nice.

18
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,138
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

19
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,975
Just a little extra air in my mouth.

20
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:05,513
Chan, can you help me out?
I'll pay you back.

21
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:10,185
Right. Including the waffles
last week, you now owe me...

22
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,827
... 1 7 jillion dollars.

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,062
-Really, I'll pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?

24
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,729
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with research.

25
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,568
What kind of research?

26
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,604
Just, you know, science.

27
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,941
Science.

28
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,376
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

29
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,154
It's a fertility study.

30
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,689
Joey, please tell me you're only
donating your time.

31
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,060
Actually, a little more than that.

32
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,565
Thank you, God.
This will bring us so much joy.

33
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,670
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

34
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,437
I just go down there
every other day...

35
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,810
...and make my contribution
to the project.

36
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,781
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!

37
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,219
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

38
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,318
That's funny. Very funny.

39
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:21,300
This is great. I actually know
somebody who loves what they do.

40
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,566
But what do you do to unwind
after a tough day at work?

41
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,834
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.

42
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:37,449
The ground-up flesh
of formerly cute cows and turkeys.

43
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,654
I just love barbecuing with you.

44
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,413
Men are here!

45
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,086
We make fire.

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,723
Cook meat.

47
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,926
Put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back.

48
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,502
Cute.

49
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,675
-Melanie called. She'll be late.
-Okay.

50
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:07,972
How are things going? Is she
becoming your "special someone"?

51
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,283
I don't know. She's pretty great.

52
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,251
What does she think of
your little science project?

53
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:21,356
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

54
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,954
Man's got a point.

55
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,861
The tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex.

56
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,969
Crazy bitch.

57
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,670
I got a week left to go.
According to the rules...

58
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:46,442
... I can't conduct personal
experiments, if you know what I mean.

59
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:50,316
Joey, we always know what you mean.

60
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,122
How long did you think
this barbecue would last?

61
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,929
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and....

62
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,666
-China?
-For the museum. Someone found a bone.

63
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,072
They don't want us to have it.

64
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,717
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whole big bone thing.

65
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,318
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.

66
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:26,823
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

67
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,727
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

68
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,293
Could you show it to Ben every now
and then so he doesn't forget me?

69
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,899
"Hi, Ben. I'm your father."

70
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,369
"I am The Head!"

71
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,751
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

72
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,649
I wanted to wish Rachel
a happy birthday before I left.

73
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,759
-She's out having drinks with Carl.
-Hey, who's Carl?

74
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,932
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.

75
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:11,695
-There's this guy she met at
-The coffeehouse? Right.

76
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,963
So you do know who he is.

77
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,244
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.

78
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,813
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.

79
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,156
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

80
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,665
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

81
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,195
Do you know who Carl is?

82
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,862
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore....
No.

83
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,937
Rachel's having
drinks with him tonight.

84
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,773
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

85
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,109
-Forget about her.
-He's right.

86
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,286
Please move on. Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.

87
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,914
Of course, there
they just call it "food."

88
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,753
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

89
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,589
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

90
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,394
We're looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

91
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:21,096
I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you.

92
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,876
I'm still on my first.

93
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,112
I just think you're nice.

94
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,623
That's when we started
this fruit basket business.

95
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:45,423
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers."

96
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,066
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.

97
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,343
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!

98
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,342
We're doing presents first.

99
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,078
Hey, hold on there, tiger.
How are you holding up?

100
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,154
Well, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna...

101
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:15,657
...complete the transaction,
if you know what And you do.

102
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,423
Have you ever thought about
being there for her?

103
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,764
What do you mean?

104
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,002
You know, just be there for her.

105
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,840
Not following you.

106
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,007
Think about it.

107
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:48,057
Okay. I'm guessing this is from....

108
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:54,157
-Thank you, Melanie.
-This one right here is from me.

109
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,270
Okay. It's light. It rattles.

110
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,494
It's...

111
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,539
...Travel Scrabble!

112
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,510
Thank you.

113
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,646
This one's from Joey.

114
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:19,655
It feels like a book, I think it's
a book. And it's a book!

115
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,759
It's Dr. Seuss!

116
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,456
That book got me through
some tough times.

117
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,661
There's a little child
inside this man.

118
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,566
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.

119
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,834
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.

120
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:48,147
Oh, my God! He remembered!

121
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,284
-Remembered what?
-lt was months ago.

122
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,993
We walked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.

123
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,925
I told him it was like one
my grandma had when I was little.

124
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,691
I can't believe he remembered!

125
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,497
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

126
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,378
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.

127
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,741
I can't believe it.

128
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,941
Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

129
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,610
...and bought her that
expensive crystal duck?

130
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,354
What did you just say?

131
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,837
Crystal duck.

132
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:49,208
No, no, no. The "love" part?

133
00:10:55,488 --> 00:11:01,393
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.

134
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:07,357
That's good. Just keep rubbing
your head. That'll turn back time.

135
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,075
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

136
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,904
I know.
This is really, really huge.

137
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:24,572
No, it's not. It's small.
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

138
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:29,778
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.

139
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,753
Is there a mute button on this woman?

140
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,588
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!

141
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,766
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!

142
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,834
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

143
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,028
... but nothing ever happened.

144
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,402
What else did he say?
Does he wanna go out?

145
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:53,043
Given that he's in love with you...

146
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,646
... he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee.

147
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:02,044
Ross? All this time?
I've gotta talk to him.

148
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,223
-He's in China!
-The country.

149
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,927
Is his flight gone?

150
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,189
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:

151
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,388
He's gone!

152
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,296
His flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

153
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,405
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?

154
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,168
-You'll never make it!
-I've gotta try.

155
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,368
What'll you say to him?

156
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,242
-I don't know.
-Then you shouldn't go.

157
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,112
Right. If you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

158
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,411
But if it's good, tell him now.

159
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:41,457
-Maybe I'll know when I see him.
-All right, does this help?

160
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:52,769
No. Look, all I know is, I cannot
wait a week. This is just too big.

161
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:57,068
I've just gotta talk to him.
Okay, I'll see you later.

162
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,939
Rachel, I love you!
Deal with me first!

163
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:14,481
All right.

164
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,496
-Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?

165
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,636
I need to talk to my friend.

166
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,774
Sorry, you're not allowed here
without a pass.

167
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,206
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can l?

168
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,380
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

169
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,540
Then could you please
just give him a message for me?

170
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,811
-This is very important.
-All right. What's the message?

171
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,619
I don't know.

172
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:53,328
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.

173
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,866
Rachel loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

174
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,697
What?

175
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,801
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

176
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:08,443
There's no Rachel.
Don't give me that deep freeze.

177
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:21,749
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

178
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,556
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

179
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,624
It was nothing.

180
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,827
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you.

181
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,775
You know what?

182
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,341
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

183
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,752
-Me, again?
-Sure. Why not?

184
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:58,354
Boy, somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

185
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:07,399
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you'd be.

186
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,971
How do you mean?

187
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,611
I had you pegged as a guy
who's always, "Me, me, me!"

188
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,076
But you, you're a giver.

189
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,315
You're the most generous man
I ever met.

190
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,546
I mean, you're practically a woman.

191
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,729
-You're just saying that.
-No.

192
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,064
A woman!

193
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,281
-So?
-I missed him.

194
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,918
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.

195
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,781
Yeah, right.

196
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,549
No, I feel bad for her. I do.

197
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:03,250
I can think of somebody
other than myself.

198
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,521
All right, I'm going to bed.

199
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,533
-Happy birthday. Hang in there.
-Thanks.

200
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,492
Yes!

201
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,238
Pizza coupons.

202
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:25,172
Okay. You guys want help
cleaning up this mess?

203
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,942
That'd be great.

204
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,486
So, Rach, you wanna save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:38,493
Are you gonna go for it with Ross
or should I throw it out?

206
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,326
I don't know. I don't know.

207
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,028
Thought about it
all the way there...

208
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,143
...and I thought about it all the way
back. You know, it's Ross!

209
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,745
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

210
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,677
-Sure!
-Sure.

211
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:03,150
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

212
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,716
... but I'm thinking
it'd be really great.

213
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,521
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be like friends-in-law!

214
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,961
The best part is you already
know all about him.

215
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,295
You start on the 1 5th date.

216
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,905
But it would be like
starting on the 1 5th date.

217
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,708
Another good point.

218
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,142
I mean, on the 1 5th date,
you're already in a very...

219
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,579
... "relationship-y" place.
You're committed.

220
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,488
What happens if it doesn't work out?

221
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,659
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.

222
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,625
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?

223
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,800
-No, I'm just
-Maybe there's someone else.

224
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:53,665
-ls there someone else?
-No, there is no one else.

225
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,500
Then why are you dumping my brother?

226
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,915
Hey, big Spender!

227
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,416
She's still asleep.

228
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:19,356
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?

229
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,592
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

230
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:28,637
Last night I couldn't do the thing
that usually makes me great.

231
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,275
So I had to do all this other stuff.

232
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,275
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!

233
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,539
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

234
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:43,520
I know. My room's very, very close
to the parade route.

235
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,621
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!

236
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:55,061
It's like, all of a sudden
I'm blind...

237
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,065
... but all my other senses
are heightened.

238
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,171
It's like I was able
to appreciate it...

239
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,464
...on another level.

240
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:10,981
-I didn't know you had another level.
-I know. Neither did l!

241
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,920
Is something going on with O.J.?

242
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,856
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?

243
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,227
-From who?
-You.

244
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,131
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

245
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,965
Well, it's the thought.

246
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:41,177
Doesn't Ross'flight get in
in a couple hours? At gate 27B?

247
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:47,083
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been
thinking about it.

248
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,584
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

249
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,778
Why?

250
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,585
I feel like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

251
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:59,594
I'd be going out with all of you.
There'd be pressure

252
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,628
No pressure, no pressure!

253
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,235
Nothing has happened,
and you're already so

254
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,397
I'm not "so." Okay, I was a teensy
bit weird at first...

255
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,737
... but I'll be good. I promise.

256
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,275
-Who is it?
-It's me, Carl.

257
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,385
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?

258
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:31,321
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

259
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,606
-Seven hundred bucks!
-All right, you did it!

260
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,110
Do we have any fruit?

261
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,283
Man, hell of a two weeks.

262
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,487
You know what?
I feel I learned something.

263
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,282
You'll stick with this
"all for her" thing?

264
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,116
What are you, crazy?

265
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:06,724
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

266
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,133
If I see one more picture
of Ed Begley Jr...

267
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:19,868
...in that stupid electric car,
I'm gonna shoot myself!

268
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,847
I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

269
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,711
...it's just that guy!

270
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:31,145
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

271
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,582
Excuse me, I'm trying
to have a date here.

272
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,154
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

273
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,893
Can't do it, can you?

274
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,001
I'm thinking about you. So what?

275
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:49,401
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?

276
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,066
Happens to be a very nice guy.

277
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,406
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

278
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,117
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

279
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,414
Ross, it's too hard.

280
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:10,323
Why, because it'll get weird
for everyone else? This is about us.

281
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,965
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

282
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,965
You're like my best friend.
If we broke up, and I lost you

283
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,968
What makes you think that?

284
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,506
Have you been involved
where you haven't broken up?

285
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,568
No.

286
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:33,214
But it only has to happen once.

287
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:38,218
You and I both know we are perfect
for each other. Right?

288
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,792
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

289
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,863
I don't know.

290
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,335
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

291
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,730
Well, start looking.

292
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,673
-Wow.
-Exactly!

293
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,851
And I'm gonna be the guy...

294
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,351
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

295
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,254
Right! You're right.

296
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,153
You know what?

297
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,696
I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

298
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,958
I am so sorry!

299
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,399
If you wanna finish your drinks,
please do.

300
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:31,098
-I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
-But....

301
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,349
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.

302
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,917
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.

303
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,454
If you want the rest of my date,
I'm not gonna finish it.

304
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:52,454
-Rachel, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.

305
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,596
Hello!

306
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,969
-Where you going?
-Airport.

307
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,539
You can't tell him.
There's so much I haven't done.

308
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,712
I haven't watched Baywatch
with Yasmine Bleeth!

309
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:13,283
Chandler, relax. This is a good
going to the airport.

310
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:17,516
Oh, well then fly, good woman,
fly like the wind.

311
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,691
-I'm flying!
-Tell him I'm the one who blew it!

312
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,927
Yes, another successful case
for the love doctor.

313
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,573
Excuse me! Pardon me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

314
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,472
Toby, for God's sake,
will you let it go?

315
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,214
There's no Rachel!

316
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,089
Hey! I got that.

317
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,785
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No problem.

318
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,462
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.

319
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,364
You don't think they'll judge me?

320
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,335
-No, they will. I just....
-Can't wait!

321
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,032
Come on, they're gonna love you.

322

{63}{127}This is pretty much|what's happened so far.
{133}{200}{y:i}Ross was in love|{y:i}with Rachel since forever.
{206}{277}{y:i}Every time he tried to tell her,|{y:i}something got in the way...
{283}{327}{y:i}... like cats, Italian guys.
{333}{407}{y:i}And finally, Chandler was,|{y:i}like, "Forget about her".
{413}{523}{y:i}When Ross was in China, Chandler|{y:i}let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.
{529}{572}{y:i}She was, like, "Oh, my God!"
{578}{644}{y:i}So she went to the airport to meet him.
{650}{765}{y:i}She didn't know Ross was getting|{y:i}off the plane with another woman.
{771}{830}That's pretty much everything|you need to know.
{836}{889}But enough about us.|How have you been?

{2773}{2827}So, so...
{2833}{2911}How was China? You!
{2917}{2963}It was great.
{2969}{2991}What happened?
{2997}{3031}- You're bleeding.|- I am?
{3037}{3082}Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.
{3088}{3147}Enough about me,|Mr. Back From The Orient!

{3539}{3558}These are...
{3564}{3589}These are...

{3664}{3703}These are for you.
{3709}{3811}Welcome to our country.
{3823}{3939}Thank you. I'm from New York.
{3959}{4060}No problem. We'll use them|to stop the bleeding.
{4101}{4158}Baggage claim?
{4307}{4396}She went to the airport, and|she's gonna go for it with Ross.

{4723}{4757}Guys, you got new haircuts!
{4763}{4856}Yes, we did.|Thanks to Vidal Buffay.
{4862}{4951}Because, you know, "If you don't|look good, we don't look good."
{4957}{5012}I love that voice!
{5018}{5075}You guys!
{5079}{5148}Airport. Airport. Ross.
{5154}{5178}Not alone.
{5184}{5217}Julie.
{5223}{5273}Arm around her!
{5279}{5347}Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!
{5353}{5413}I think she's trying|to tell us something.
{5419}{5478}Quick, get the verbs.
{5484}{5525}You! You!
{5531}{5578}You said he liked me!
{5584}{5605}You!
{5611}{5669}You slowpokes!
{5675}{5774}That's all right.|We got the bags.
{5824}{5876}This is my sister, Monica.
{5882}{5913}This is Chandler.
{5919}{5945}Phoebe, hi.
{5951}{6003}Joey.
{6009}{6059}Everyone, this is Julie.
{6065}{6122}Julie.
{6238}{6284}But I'm not here,|you haven't met me.
{6290}{6382}I'll make a better impression when|I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.
{6388}{6440}- And bus.|- Oh, my God!
{6446}{6497}- With the screaming guy...|- And the spitting.
{6503}{6539}You gotta hear this story.
{6545}{6601}We're on this bus|that's 200 years old.
{6607}{6637}Two hundred, at least.
{6643}{6726}And the chicken poops in her lap!
{6859}{6903}I'm so sorry.
{6909}{6958}I just gave away the ending, didn't I?
{6964}{7020}I just heard this story in the cab...
{7026}{7151}...and it is all I can think about.
{7171}{7242}This is amazing.
{7242}{7269}How did this happen?
{7275}{7314}We were in grad school together.
{7320}{7398}We haven't seen each other since then.|I land in China...
{7404}{7448}...guess who's in charge of the dig?
{7454}{7518}Julie!
{7521}{7563}Isn't that great?
{7569}{7715}Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,|spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
{7729}{7790}It's an expression.
{7799}{7852}We just wanted to say a quick hi.
{7858}{7922}- Then we'll see the baby.|- Then get some sleep.
{7928}{7973}It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.
{7979}{8096}Don't tell us what's gonna happen.|I like being surprised.
{8177}{8244}Bye!
{8474}{8537}- Can I get some coffee?|- Sure.
{8543}{8582}- Did you talk to him yet?|- No.
{8588}{8657}Then, no.
{8922}{8981}What the hell happened to you in China?
{8987}{9068}When last we left you,|you were in love with, you know.
{9074}{9101}I know I was.
{9107}{9180}But there was always this voice|inside that kept saying:
{9186}{9298}"It's never gonna happen. Move on."|You know whose voice that was?
{9304}{9353}God?
{9359}{9413}It was you, pal.
{9419}{9500}Maybe it was God doing me.
{9503}{9605}You were right. She looks at me|and sees a friend. That's all.
{9611}{9660}And then I met Julie...
{9666}{9711}...and we're having a great time.
{9717}{9826}I never would have gone for it,|if it hadn't been for you.
{9854}{9922}Well, you owe me one, big guy.
{9928}{9953}Your lemonade.
{9959}{10022}I didn't order it.
{10028}{10103}Then go take that back.|They'll charge you for that.
{10109}{10204}Go, go, go! Come on, come on!
{10223}{10282}So what did you find out?
{10288}{10320}He said...
{10326}{10398}He said...
{10438}{10492}They're having a great time.
{10498}{10553}I'm sorry.
{10559}{10623}But the silver lining,|if you wanna see it...
{10629}{10703}...is that he made this decision|all by himself...
{10709}{10797}...without any outside help whatsoever.
{10803}{10857}How is that a silver lining?
{10863}{10964}You have to really wanna see it.
{11063}{11151}Ironically, these guys|were picked last in gym.
{11157}{11193}Hey, Pheebs.
{11199}{11279}You know what I'm thinking?
{11359}{11397}How...
{11403}{11465}...it's been so long|since you've had sex...
{11471}{11556}...you're wondering|if they've changed it?
{11562}{11679}No. Although now|that's what I'm thinking.
{11682}{11720}So what were you thinking?
{11726}{11845}You gave the guys great haircuts.|I thought you'd like to do mine.
{11851}{11901}No.
{11907}{11927}Why not?
{11933}{11975}Because I'm just...
{11981}{12062}I'm incredibly anal and|an unbelievable control freak.
{12068}{12103}No, you're not.
{12109}{12161}I know I'm not, but you are.
{12167}{12264}I was trying to spare your feelings.
{12311}{12332}Hold on.
{12338}{12412}Ross, Julie for you.
{12551}{12582}Anybody know a good tailor?
{12588}{12622}You need clothes altered?
{12628}{12723}No, I'm just looking for a man|to draw on me with chalk.
{12729}{12802}Go see Frankie. My family's|been going to him forever.
{12808}{12853}He did my first suit when I was 15.
{12859}{12915}No, wait, 16.
{12921}{13028}No, excuse me, 15.
{13034}{13124}All right, when was 1990?
{13146}{13250}You have to stop the Q-Tip|when there's resistance!
{13444}{13486}Sweetheart, I'll see you later.
{13492}{13557}Okay, bye.
{13579}{13669}That is so sweet.
{13721}{13767}Okay. No, you hang up.
{13773}{13839}No, you...
{13851}{13949}One, two, three.
{13973}{14002}You didn't hang up either.
{14008}{14089}She didn't hang up.
{14183}{14212}No, you hang up.
{14218}{14309}You. You.
{14494}{14584}Sorry, I thought|you were talking to me.
{14598}{14632}Rachel.
{14638}{14719}I'll just call her back.
{14719}{14772}Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.|We got disconnected.
{14778}{14833}No, you hang up.
{14839}{14873}How did this happen to me?
{14879}{14947}A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
{14953}{15016}Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
{15022}{15117}Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
{15123}{15223}...this really great guy|that I can't have.
{15229}{15286}Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
{15292}{15350}I know you did.
{15368}{15464}I'm just gonna deal with it.
{15504}{15599}I gotta get out of here!
{15626}{15744}I don't care what you guys say,|something's bothering her.
{15834}{15939}You know, I think I was 16.
{15952}{16017}Please, just a little bit off the back.
{16023}{16091}I'm still on "no".
{16114}{16158}Morning.
{16164}{16210}Could you close your eyes for a sec?
{16216}{16329}No, no, no. I'm not|falling for that again.
{16347}{16367}What's going on?
{16373}{16425}I sort of did a stupid thing last night.
{16431}{16511}What stupid thing did you do?
{16732}{16787}Why don't you just go get dressed...
{16793}{16890}...then you'll be on your way.|Bye-bye.
{16896}{16937}How did this happen?
{16943}{16993}I kind of ran into him last night.
{16999}{17028}- Where?|- At his apartment.
{17034}{17082}Is this juice?
{17088}{17177}And the fact that you dumped him|because he hit on Phoebe?
{17183}{17271}Oh, God, I know.|I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.
{17277}{17337}Honey, you're not pathetic.|You're just sad.
{17343}{17398}People do stupid things|when they're upset.
{17404}{17515}My God, if I had a nickel|for every guy I wish I hadn't...
{17578}{17674}But this is about your horrible mistake.
{17757}{17777}Sorry we're late.
{17783}{17813}We were...
{17819}{17904}Well, there was touching.
{18006}{18063}Hey, Ross!
{18069}{18132}What a...
{18138}{18185}What are you doing here?
{18191}{18251}I do Raquel!
{18389}{18430}So he's back?
{18436}{18497}Yeah, he's back.|Is that a problem?
{18503}{18546}No, not a problem.
{18552}{18608}Good. Glad it's not a problem.
{18614}{18719}You're gonna have to not touch my ass.
{18788}{18870}Despite the yummy bagels|and palpable tension...
{18876}{18912}...my pants need to be altered.
{18918}{19003}When you see Frankie,|tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
{19009}{19084}He'll know what it means.
{19104}{19183}You sure he'll crack that code?
{19200}{19308}It's funny. The last time Paolo|was here, my hair was so much cuter.
{19314}{19365}All right.
{19371}{19475}But you have to promise that you|will not be all controlly and bossy...
{19481}{19557}...and all Monica about it.
{19563}{19588}I promise.
{19594}{19630}All right, let's see.
{19636}{19760}Now, some of you are gonna get cut|and some of you aren't.
{19766}{19855}But I promise, none of you|will feel a thing.
{20149}{20230}- That's it. I quit.|- What? I didn't say anything!
{20236}{20320}But this isn't the face of|a person who trusts a person.
{20326}{20397}This is the face of|a person who, you know...
{20403}{20472}...doesn't trust a person.
{20478}{20517}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{20523}{20609}It's just a little shorter|than what we had discussed.
{20615}{20698}Would you relax?|I know what I am doing.
{20704}{20804}This is how he wears it.
{20816}{20842}How who wears it?
{20848}{20901}Demi Moore.
{20907}{20949}Demi Moore is not a "he".
{20955}{21056}Well, he was a "he"|in "Arthur" and in "10".
{21072}{21107}That's Dudley Moore!
{21113}{21215}I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
{21224}{21266}Oh, my God!
{21272}{21322}Oh, God!
{21328}{21383}Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
{21389}{21422}Which one is Demi Moore?
{21428}{21542}She's the actress that was in|{y:i}Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
{21548}{21585}She's got gorgeous hair.
{21591}{21654}I know!
{21801}{21850}How long do you want the cuffs?
{21856}{21955}At least as long as I have the pants.
{22014}{22089}I just got that.
{22137}{22234}Now we'll do your inseam.
{22506}{22555}How is she?
{22561}{22631}It's too soon to tell.
{22637}{22723}She's resting, which is a good sign.
{22729}{22758}How's the hair?
{22764}{22874}I'm not gonna lie to you.|It doesn't look good.
{22884}{22998}I put a clip on one side, which seems|to have stopped the curling.
{23004}{23039}Can we see her?
{23045}{23123}Your hair looks too good.|It'd upset her.
{23129}{23195}Ross, you come on in.
{23347}{23380}Well, how you doing?
{23386}{23406}I'm okay.
{23412}{23472}That bad, huh?
{23474}{23557}Look, I can sense when women|are depressed and vulnerable.
{23563}{23637}It's one of my gifts.
{23728}{23817}Joey, when I saw him|get off that plane with her...
{23823}{23898}...I really thought|I just hit rock bottom.
{23904}{23985}But today, it's like|there's rock bottom...
{23991}{24037}...50 feet of crap...
{24043}{24103}...then me.
{24109}{24147}Tell Ross how you feel.
{24153}{24225}Come on, how can I just tell him?|What about Julie?
{24231}{24302}What about her? They've only|been going out for two weeks.
{24308}{24397}Ross has been in love|with you for 10 years.
{24403}{24465}I don't know. I don't know.
{24471}{24536}I've been with my share of women.
{24542}{24629}I've been with a lot|of people's share of women.
{24635}{24676}But the point is...
{24682}{24814}...I've never felt about anyone|the way Ross felt about you.
{24832}{24899}Really?
{25023}{25101}Yo, paisan!
{25129}{25214}Can I talk to you for a sec?
{25259}{25296}Your tailor...
{25302}{25395}...is a very bad man!
{25409}{25445}What are you talking about?
{25451}{25534}Hey, what's going on?
{25614}{25684}Joey's tailor...
{25739}{25814}...took advantage of me.
{25837}{25912}No way! I've been going|to the guy for 12 years.
{25918}{25967}He said he was gonna do my inseam.
{25973}{26061}Then he ran his hand up my leg|and then there was definite...
{26067}{26107}What?
{26113}{26189}Cupping.
{26223}{26324}That's how they do pants!
{26324}{26385}First they go up one side,|they move it over.
{26391}{26525}Then they go up the other side,|move it back, then they do the rear.
{26554}{26627}Ross, tell him. Isn't that|how a tailor measures pants?
{26633}{26720}Yes, yes, it is.|In prison!
{26854}{26902}What's the matter with you?
{26908}{26969}What?
{27018}{27075}That's not?
{27192}{27262}Oh, my God!
{27406}{27503}Even Mary Tyler Moore|would've been better.
{27526}{27565}I like it.
{27571}{27643}I do. I think it's a 10!
{27689}{27716}Thank you.
{27722}{27758}My hair is very amused.
{27764}{27831}Come on, things could be worse.
{27837}{27951}You could "get caught between|the moon and New York City.
{27963}{28043}I know it's crazy, but it's true."
{28076}{28111}Thank you.
{28117}{28170}Well, I gotta go. Bye.
{28176}{28202}Bye, Rach!
{28208}{28245}Wait, are you leaving?
{28251}{28311}That's what I meant by "bye".
{28317}{28403}Can I talk to you for a sec?
{28459}{28545}When the doctor does|that hernia test...
{28551}{28625}That's okay.
{28672}{28730}What's going on?
{28739}{28823}Well, okay, first of all...
{28829}{28893}...Paolo and I are not back together.
{28899}{28947}That was a stupid thing I did.
{28953}{29026}If I could go back in time|and do it again...
{29032}{29117}...well, I wouldn't.
{29152}{29200}Second of all...
{29206}{29266}What?
{29303}{29393}Is this one of those things|where you break up with a guy...
{29399}{29432}...I tell you what I think...
{29438}{29497}...and the next day|you get back together with him...
{29503}{29594}...and I look like|a complete idiot?
{29612}{29688}Well, then, I think the guy's scum.
{29694}{29803}I hate him. I mean, I actually...|I physically hate him.
{29809}{29837}I always have.
{29843}{29953}And you are way too good|to be with a guy like that.
{29959}{29993}Really?
{29999}{30066}You deserve to be with someone|who appreciates you...
{30072}{30118}...and who gets how funny...
{30124}{30184}...and sweet and amazing...
{30190}{30262}...and adorable and sexy you are.
{30268}{30355}You know? Someone who wakes up|every morning thinking:
{30361}{30446}"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"
{30452}{30523}You know? Someone|who makes you feel good.
{30529}{30615}Like the way I do with Julie.
{30716}{30812}Was there a "second of all"?
{30911}{31024}No, I think that was the whole "all".
{31039}{31104}I gotta go.
{31113}{31180}Thanks.
{31326}{31370}No, I swear to God, Dad!
{31376}{31463}That's not how they measure pants!
{31612}{31697}I was thinking of doing it shorter,|like Andie MacDowell's haircut.
{31703}{31760}- Yeah, I could do that.|- Really?
{31766}{31846}- You wanna do it now?|- Great!
{31869}{31921}See you.
{31927}{31991}I just wanna make|really sure this time.
{31997}{32122}Andie MacDowell is the girl from|"Four Weddings and a Funeral", right?
{32128}{32189}No.
{32238}{32307}That's Roddy McDowall.
{32313}{32426}Andie MacDowell is the guy|from "Planet of the Apes".
{32461}{32544}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,134
Ross was in love
with Rachel since forever.

2
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,399
Every time he tried to tell her,
something got in the way...

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:12,474
...like cats, Italian guys.

4
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,874
And finally, Chandler was,
like, "Forget about her."

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:20,677
When Ross was in China, Chandler
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,751
She was, like, "Oh, my God!"

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,787
So she went to the airport to meet him.

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:29,620
She didn't know Ross was getting
off the plane with another woman.

9
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,599
That's pretty much everything
you need to know.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,061
But enough about us.
How have you been?

11
00:00:53,586 --> 00:11:34,473
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

12
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,240
Flight number 457
from Beijing now arriving.

13
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,712
Oh, my God!

14
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,719
Oh, my God!

15
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:34,990
Excuse me.

16
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,788
Move, move, move!
Emergency, please!

17
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,463
Excuse me, excuse me.

18
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,773
There you are!

19
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,176
So, so...

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,144
How was China? You!

21
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,886
It was great.

22
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,053
What happened?

23
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,755
- You're bleeding.
- I am?

24
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,854
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

25
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,560
Enough about me,
Mr. Back From The Orient!

26
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,525
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

27
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,625
Well, where do I start?

28
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,771
This is Julie.
Julie, this is Rachel.

29
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:25,841
These are...

30
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,137
These are...

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,506
...aren't for you.

32
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,683
These are for you.

33
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,814
Welcome to our country.

34
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,188
Thank you. I'm from New York.

35
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,223
No problem. We'll use them
to stop the bleeding.

36
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,364
Baggage claim?

37
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,973
I'm telling U. She went to the airport,
and she's gonna go for it with Ross.

38
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,773
Oh, my God! This is huge!

39
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,645
This is bigger than huge.
This is...

40
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,148
All right, what's bigger than huge?

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:12,989
This?

42
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,128
Guys, you got new haircuts!

43
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,422
Yes, we did.
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

44
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,196
Because, you know, "If you don't
look good, we don't look good."

45
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,165
I love that voice!

46
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,508
And the winner is Eva Godna!

47
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,975
Airport. Airport. Ross.

48
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:38,575
Not alone.

49
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,816
Julie.

50
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,216
Arm around her!

51
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,153
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

52
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,951
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

53
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,163
Quick, get the verbs.

54
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,559
You! You!

55
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,834
You said he liked me!

56
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,034
You!

57
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,636
You slowpokes!

58
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,466
That's all right.
We got the bags.

59
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,808
This is my sister, Monica.

60
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,811
This is Chandler.

61
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,038
Phoebe, hi.

62
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,318
Joey.

63
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,811
Everyone, this is Julie.

64
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,919
Julie.

65
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,160
But I'm not here,
you haven't met me.

66
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,334
I'll make a better impression when
I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.

67
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,729
- And bus.
- Oh, my God!

68
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,030
- With the screaming guy
- And the spitting.

69
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,841
You gotta hear this story.

70
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,441
We're on this bus
that's 200 years old.

71
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,939
Two hundred, at least.

72
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,010
And the chicken poops in her lap!

73
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,951
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,249
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?

75
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,790
I just heard this story in the cab...

76
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,724
...and it is all I can think about.

77
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,601
This is amazing.

78
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,264
How did this happen?

79
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,098
We were in grad school together.

80
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,605
We haven't seen each other since then.
I land in China...

81
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,675
...guess who's in charge of the dig?

82
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,004
Julie!

83
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,047
Isn't that great?

84
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:23,212
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

85
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,290
It's an expression.

86
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,489
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

87
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,357
- Then we'll see the baby.
- Then get some sleep.

88
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,566
It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.

89
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,134
Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
I like being surprised.

90
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,271
Bye!

91
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,851
- Can I get some coffee?
- Sure.

92
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,354
- Did you talk to him yet?
- No.

93
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,958
Then, no.

94
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,403
What the hell happened to you in China?

95
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,640
When last we left you,
you were in love with, you know.

96
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,606
I know I was.

97
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,783
But there was always this voice
inside that kept saying:

98
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,215
"It's never gonna happen. Move on."
You know whose voice that was?

99
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,014
God?

100
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,893
It was you, pal.

101
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,659
Maybe it was God doing me.

102
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,466
You were right. She looks at me
and sees a friend. That's all.

103
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,569
And then I met Julie...

104
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,441
...and we're having a great time.

105
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,647
I never would have gone for it,
if it hadn't been for you.

106
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,784
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

107
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,478
Your lemonade.

108
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,756
I didn't order it.

109
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,594
Then go take that back.
They'll charge you for that.

110
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,361
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

111
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,598
So what did you find out?

112
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,766
He said...

113
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,503
He said...

114
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,334
They're having a great time.

115
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,678
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,307
But the silver lining,
if you wanna see it...

117
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,378
...is that he made this decision
all by himself...

118
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,989
...without any outside help whatsoever.

119
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,423
How is that a silver lining?

120
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,356
You have to really wanna see it.

121
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,027
Ironically, these guys
were picked last in gym.

122
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,031
Hey, Pheebs.

123
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,932
You know what I'm thinking?

124
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,080
How...

125
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,374
...it's been so long
since you've had sex...

126
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,482
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

127
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,959
No. Although now
that's what I'm thinking.

128
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,796
So what were you thinking?

129
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,531
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you'd like to do mine.

130
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,737
No.

131
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,471
Why not?

132
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,833
Because I'm just...

133
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,135
I'm incredibly anal and
an unbelievable control freak.

134
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,305
No, you're not.

135
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,342
I know I'm not, but you are.

136
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,087
I was trying to spare your feelings.

137
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,188
Hold on.

138
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,388
Ross, Julie for you.

139
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,656
Anybody know a good tailor?

140
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,325
You need clothes altered?

141
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,960
No, I'm just looking for a man
to draw on me with chalk.

142
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,060
Go see Frankie. My family's
been going to him forever.

143
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,199
He did my first suit when I was 15.

144
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,869
No, wait, 16.

145
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,835
No, excuse me, 15.

146
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,306
All right, when was 1990?

147
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,750
You have to stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance!

148
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,458
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

149
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,890
Okay, bye.

150
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,797
That is so sweet.

151
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,698
Okay. No, you hang up.

152
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,204
No, you

153
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,973
One, two, three.

154
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,345
You didn't hang up either.

155
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,585
She didn't hang up.

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,554
No, you hang up.

157
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,159
You. You.

158
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,838
Sorry, I thought
you were talking to me.

159
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,334
Rachel.

160
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,146
I'll just call her back.

161
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,315
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
We got disconnected.

162
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,209
No, you hang up.

163
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,648
How did this happen to me?

164
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,255
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

165
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,752
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

166
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,825
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...

167
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,135
...this really great guy
that I can't have.

168
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,730
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

169
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,304
I know you did.

170
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,472
I'm just gonna deal with it.

171
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,545
I gotta get out of here!

172
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:33,016
I don't care what you guys say,
something's bothering her.

173
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,497
You know, I think I was 16.

174
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,302
Please, just a little bit off the back.

175
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,840
I'm still on "no."

176
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,110
Morning.

177
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,179
Could you close your eyes for a sec?

178
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,511
No, no, no. I'm not
falling for that again.

179
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,618
What's going on?

180
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,051
I sort of did a stupid
thing last night.

181
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,022
What stupid thing did you do?

182
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,968
Why don't you just go get dressed...

183
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,563
...then you'll be on your way.
Bye-bye.

184
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,367
How did this happen?

185
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,871
I kind of ran into him last night.

186
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,376
- Where?
- At his apartment.

187
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,082
Is this juice?

188
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,447
And the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

189
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,882
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

190
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,217
Honey, you're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

191
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,759
People do stupid things
when they're upset.

192
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,090
My God, if I had a nickel
for every guy I wish I hadn't

193
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,806
But this is about
your horrible mistake.

194
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,608
Sorry we're late.

195
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,174
We were...

196
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,348
Well, there was touching.

197
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,190
Hey, Ross!

198
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,190
What a...

199
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,695
What are you doing here?

200
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,862
I do Raquel!

201
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,933
So he's back?

202
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,708
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a problem?

203
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,374
No, not a problem.

204
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,841
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

205
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,445
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

206
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,981
Despite the yummy bagels
and palpable tension...

207
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,082
...my pants need to be altered.

208
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,727
When you see Frankie,
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

209
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,688
He'll know what it means.

210
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,897
You sure he'll crack that code?

211
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,165
It's funny. The last time Paolo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

212
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,309
All right.

213
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,646
But you have to promise that you
will not be all controlly and bossy...

214
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,852
...and all Monica about it.

215
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,354
I promise.

216
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,122
All right, let's see.

217
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:22,622
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

218
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,956
But I promise, none of you
will feel a thing.

219
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,244
- That's it. I quit.
- What? I didn't say anything!

220
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,348
But this isn't the face of
a person who trusts a person.

221
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,849
This is the face of
a person who, you know...

222
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,247
...doesn't trust a person.

223
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,921
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

224
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,753
It's just a little shorter
than what we had discussed.

225
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,489
Would you relax?
I know what I am doing.

226
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,295
This is how he wears it.

227
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,465
How who wears it?

228
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,867
Demi Moore.

229
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,905
Demi Moore is not a "he."

230
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,739
Well, he was a "he"
in Arthur and in 10.

231
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,275
That's Dudley Moore!

232
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,621
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!

233
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,949
Oh, my God!

234
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,150
Oh, God!

235
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,354
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

236
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,324
Which one is Demi Moore?

237
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:38,067
She's the actress that was in
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!

238
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,601
She's got gorgeous hair.

239
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,463
I know!

240
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,057
How long do you want the cuffs?

241
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,830
At least as long as I have the pants.

242
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,003
I just got that.

243
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,503
Now we'll do your inseam.

244
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,286
How is she?

245
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,524
It's too soon to tell.

246
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,162
She's resting, which is a good sign.

247
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,364
How's the hair?

248
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,870
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It doesn't look good.

249
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:00,275
I put a clip on one side, which seems
to have stopped the curling.

250
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,278
Can we see her?

251
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,913
Your hair looks too good.
It'd upset her.

252
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,586
Ross, you come on in.

253
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,934
Well, how you doing?

254
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:17,931
I'm okay.

255
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,135
That bad, huh?

256
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:24,242
Look, I can sense when women
are depressed and vulnerable.

257
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,977
It's one of my gifts.

258
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,945
Joey, when I saw him
get off that plane with her...

259
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,087
...I really thought
I just hit rock bottom.

260
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,957
But today, it's like
there's rock bottom...

261
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,195
...50 feet of crap...

262
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,761
...then me.

263
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,724
Tell Ross how you feel.

264
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,027
Come on, how can I just tell him?
What about Julie?

265
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,205
What about her? They've only
been going out for two weeks.

266
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,533
Ross has been in love
with you for 10 years.

267
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,878
I don't know. I don't know.

268
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,511
I've been with my share of women.

269
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,085
I've been with a lot
of people's share of women.

270
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,715
But the point is...

271
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,891
...I've never felt about anyone
the way Ross felt about you.

272
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,491
Really?

273
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,865
Yo, paisan!

274
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,576
Can I talk to you for a sec?

275
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,547
Your tailor...

276
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,079
...is a very bad man!

277
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,744
What are you talking about?

278
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,853
Hey, what's going on?

279
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,092
Joey's tailor...

280
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,525
...took advantage of me.

281
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,198
No way! I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

282
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,442
He said he was gonna do my inseam.

283
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,407
Then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite

284
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,579
What?

285
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,107
Cupping.

286
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,714
That's how they do pants!

287
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,782
First they go up one side,
they move it over.

288
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:26,087
Then they go up the other side,
move it back, then they do the rear.

289
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,960
Ross, tell him. Isn't that
how a tailor measures pants?

290
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,228
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison!

291
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,346
What's the matter with you?

292
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,604
What?

293
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,017
That's not?

294
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,725
Oh, my God!

295
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,502
Even Mary Tyler Moore
would've been better.

296
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:22,949
I like it.

297
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,455
I do. I think it's a 10!

298
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,986
Thank you.

299
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,729
My hair is very amused.

300
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,558
Come on, things could be worse.

301
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,161
You could "get caught between
the moon and New York City.

302
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,968
I know it's crazy, but it's true."

303
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,309
Thank you.

304
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,706
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

305
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,039
Bye, Rach!

306
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,805
Wait, are you leaving?

307
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,813
That's what I meant by "bye."

308
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,744
Can I talk to you for a sec?

309
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,685
When the doctor does
that hernia test...

310
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,919
That's okay.

311
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,106
What's going on?

312
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,242
Well, okay, first of all...

313
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,342
...Paolo and I are not back together.

314
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,653
That was a stupid thing I did.

315
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,720
If I could go back in time
and do it again...

316
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,124
...well, I wouldn't.

317
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,459
Second of all...

318
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,261
What?

319
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:47,098
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

320
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,839
...I tell you what I think...

321
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,474
...and the next day
you get back together with him...

322
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,973
...and I look like
a complete idiot?

323
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,340
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

324
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,917
I hate him. I mean, I actually
I physically hate him.

325
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,516
I always have.

326
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,625
And you are way too good
to be with a guy like that.

327
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,493
Really?

328
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,994
You deserve to be with someone
who appreciates you...

329
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,201
...and who gets how funny...

330
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,927
...and sweet and amazing...

331
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,174
...and adorable and sexy you are.

332
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:27,003
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking:

333
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,940
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!"

334
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,813
You know? Someone
who makes you feel good.

335
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,177
Like the way I do with Julie.

336
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,361
Was there a "second of all"?

337
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,196
No, I think that was the whole "all."

338
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,534
I gotta go.

339
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,806
Thanks.

340
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,853
No, I swear to God, Dad!

341
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,316
That's not how they measure pants!

342
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,389
I was thinking of doing it shorter,
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

343
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,067
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Really?

344
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,066
- You wanna do it now?
- Great!

345
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:30,869
See you.

346
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,739
I just wanna make
really sure this time.

347
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,314
Andie MacDowell is the girl from
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

348
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,384
No.

349
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,285
That's Roddy McDowall.

350
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:51,286
Andie MacDowell is the guy
from Planet of the Apes.

351
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,264
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

9999

{12156}{12225}That'd be great.|See you then. Bye.
{12231}{12319}Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?
{12402}{12438}Yes, I did.
{12444}{12532}That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
{12597}{12700}Yeah, he likes it.|Reaffirms his faith.
{12800}{12863}Ben, dinner!
{12869}{12903}Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
{12909}{12992}Did you microwave that?|You can't do that to breast milk.
{12998}{13103}I think I know|how to heat breast milk.
{13156}{13207}What did you just do?
{13213}{13254}I licked my arm, what?
{13260}{13313}It's breast milk!
{13319}{13349}So?
{13355}{13468}Phoebe, that is juice|squeezed from a person.
{13473}{13559}What is the big deal?
{13572}{13652}What did you just do?
{13666}{13783}Can people stop|drinking the breast milk?
{13784}{13853}You won't even taste it?
{13859}{13915}Not even if you just|pretend it's milk?
{13921}{14055}Not even if Carol's breast had|a picture of a missing child on it.
{14204}{14293}- Where is everybody?|- At the park. Where have you been?
{14299}{14322}Just out.
{14328}{14456}Had some lunch. Just me.|A little quality time with me.
{14462}{14517}- Thanks for your jacket.|- No problem.
{14523}{14601}You can borrow it, by the way.
{14607}{14689}Here are your keys, honey.
{14747}{14876}If you were at lunch alone,|how come it cost you $53?
{14920}{14973}You know what probably happened?
{14979}{15057}Someone stole my credit card.
{15069}{15159}And put the receipt|back in your pocket?
{15164}{15236}That is an excellent,|excellent question.
{15242}{15302}That is excellent.
{15308}{15377}What's with you?|Who did you have lunch with?
{15383}{15413}- Judy.|- Who?
{15419}{15443}- Julie.|- What?
{15449}{15519}Jody.
{15522}{15581}You were with Julie?
{15587}{15673}When it started, I was just|trying to be nice to her...
{15679}{15745}...because she was|my brother's girlfriend.
{15751}{15838}And then one thing|led to another...
{15844}{15908}...and before I knew it, we were...
{15914}{15988}...shopping.
{16068}{16127}Oh, my God!
{16144}{16224}Wait, we only did it once.
{16241}{16315}It meant nothing to me!
{16362}{16469}Really, I was thinking|of you the whole time.
{16504}{16603}Look, I'm sorry, all right?|I never meant for you to find out.
{16609}{16703}Oh, please! Please!|You wanted to get caught!
{16709}{16738}That is not true!
{16744}{16822}So you just happened|to leave it in here?
{16828}{16953}Did it ever occur to you|that I might just be that stupid?
{16963}{17055}Okay, I just have to know one thing.
{17109}{17195}Did you go to Bloomingdale's?
{17494}{17628}Okay, I just really need|to not be with you right now.
{17834}{17863}Hi, who's this?
{17869}{17962}Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?|It's Monica.
{17968}{18028}Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.
{18034}{18126}Joanne, it's not|as simple as all that.
{18132}{18263}No, I don't care what Steve thinks.|Hi, Steve.
{18355}{18383}How did we do?
{18389}{18465}I tasted Ben's milk|and Ross freaked out.
{18471}{18500}I did not freak out.
{18506}{18603}- Why'd you freak out?|- Because it's breast milk.
{18609}{18648}It's gross!
{18654}{18726}My breast milk is gross?
{18734}{18818}This should be fun.
{18830}{18871}There's nothing wrong with it.
{18877}{18965}I just don't think|breast milk is for adults.
{18971}{19086}Of course, the packaging does|appeal to grownups and kids.
{19104}{19173}Don't be silly. I've tried it.|It's no big deal.
{19179}{19238}Just taste it.
{19244}{19303}That would be no.
{19309}{19332}- Come on.|- Try it.
{19338}{19360}It's natural.
{19366}{19398}It doesn't taste bad.
{19404}{19472}Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.|Sort of like...
{19478}{19497}Like what?
{19503}{19527}Cantaloupe juice.
{19533}{19603}Exactly.
{19739}{19786}You've tasted it.
{19792}{19864}You've tasted it.
{19883}{19963}Oh, you've tasted it.
{19978}{20085}You can keep saying it,|but it won't stop being true.
{20238}{20308}Give me the bottle.
{20411}{20483}Get me the towel.
{21047}{21108}Howdy.
{21128}{21214}Give me a bo x of juice.
{21234}{21293}Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
{21299}{21396}Maybe it's because of|the way you're dressed.
{21402}{21497}Or this guy's doing so good|they want to put more people on it.
{21503}{21610}This guy goes through|two bottles a day now.
{21628}{21678}What do you care?
{21684}{21761}You're an actor.|This is your day job. It's nothing!
{21767}{21826}I know, but I was the best.
{21832}{21943}You know? I liked being the best.
{22016}{22071}Maybe I should get|out of the game.
{22077}{22155}They need guys up in housewares|to serve cheese.
{22161}{22187}Say you do that.
{22193}{22329}Sooner or later, somebody will come|along that slices a better cheddar.
{22341}{22378}Then where you gonna run?
{22384}{22405}You're right.
{22411}{22493}I say you show him what you're made of.|Stand your ground.
{22499}{22621}Show him that you're the baddest|Hombre west of the lingerie!
{22627}{22695}- I'm gonna do it!|- All right!
{22701}{22828}Now, go see Miss Kitty and|she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
{22845}{22883}I don't know what to say.
{22889}{22956}That's good because I'm not listening.
{22962}{23004}I feel terrible. I really do.
{23010}{23100}I'm sorry.|Did my back hurt your knife?
{23142}{23253}Say that I'm friends with her.|Is that so terrible?
{23259}{23320}- It's that terrible?|- You don't get it!
{23326}{23367}It's bad enough|she stole the guy...
{23373}{23438}...who may be the person|I'm supposed to be with.
{23444}{23496}But now...
{23502}{23553}...she's actually...
{23559}{23660}But now she's actually stealing you!
{23712}{23758}What are you talking about?
{23764}{23820}Nobody could steal me from you.
{23826}{23960}Because I'm friends with her doesn't|make me any less friends with you.
{23966}{24036}You're my...
{24041}{24111}And we're...
{24149}{24254}- Oh, I love you!|- I love you too!
{24324}{24443}You guys, I know that this really|doesn't have anything to do with me.
{24449}{24523}But I love you guys too!
{24629}{24719}I really needed that.
{24726}{24773}I know that right now...
{24779}{24840}...you really need|to hate Julie's guts.
{24846}{24923}But she didn't do anything wrong.
{24929}{25035}She's just a girl who met a guy,|and now they go out.
{25041}{25148}I think that if you gave her|a chance, you'd like her.
{25174}{25228}Will you give it a chance?
{25234}{25300}For me?
{25319}{25377}I'd do anything for you,|you know that.
{25383}{25460}I'd do anything for you!
{25466}{25544}Wait, wait, wait!
{25953}{26010}Mornin'.
{26034}{26130}I said, mornin'!
{26136}{26201}I heard you.
{26202}{26278}All right, everybody.|I'm opening the doors.
{26284}{26350}You boys ready?
{26445}{26478}Ready.
{26484}{26554}Yeah, I'm ready.
{27637}{27696}You idiot! You stupid cowboy!
{27702}{27749}You've blinded me! I'm suing!
{27755}{27847}Oh, my God! Todd!|What the hell did you do?
{27853}{27892}Sorry. I'm such a doofus!
{27898}{27975}I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
{27981}{28040}My God, what happened?
{28046}{28103}These new kids, they never last.
{28109}{28176}Sooner or later they all...
{28182}{28248}...stop lasting.
{28254}{28342}What do you say I buy you|that cup of coffee now?
{28348}{28409}Sure.
{28834}{28888}I just thought we should hang out.
{28894}{28963}I mean, you know,|we've never really talked.
{28969}{29042}I guess you'd know that,|being one of the two of us.
{29048}{29096}I know.
{29102}{29180}I probably shouldn't|even tell you this...
{29186}{29280}...but I'm pretty much|totally intimidated by you.
{29286}{29312}Really?
{29318}{29342}Me?
{29348}{29393}Oh, my God, are you kidding?
{29399}{29440}Ross is so crazy about you...
{29446}{29522}...and I really wanted you|to like me, and I...
{29528}{29595}It's probably me just|being totally paranoid...
{29601}{29722}...but I kind of got the feeling|that maybe you don't.
{29908}{29990}Well, you're not totally paranoid.
{30256}{30338}When you and Ross|first started going out...
{30344}{30434}...it was really hard for me...
{30447}{30585}...for many reasons of which|I'm not gonna bore you with now.
{30664}{30795}I see how happy he is|and how good you guys are together.
{30801}{30897}And Monica's always|saying how nice you are...
{30903}{30993}...and God, I hate it when she's right!
{31007}{31050}Thanks.
{31056}{31145}Would you like to go to|a movie sometime or something?
{31151}{31217}Yeah, that'd be great.|I'd love it.
{31223}{31283}I'd love it too.
{31289}{31320}Shoot, I gotta go.
{31326}{31433}- So I'll talk to you later.|- All right, Julie.
{31608}{31703}What a manipulative bitch.
{32431}{32488}It's not bad.
1
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,773
These were unbelievely expensive
and he'll grow out of them...

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,705
...in 20 minutes,
but I couldn't resist!

3
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,550
Look at these.

4
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,883
Hey, Ben.

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,746
"Just do it"!

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,184
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,415
Was that too much
pressure for him?

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,459
- Is he hungry already?
- I guess so.

9
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,157
You know, it's...

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,195
Something funny about sneakers.
I'll be right back.

11
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,169
I gotta get one too.

12
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,743
Hey, what are you guys doing?

13
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,447
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,516
Ladle?

15
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,946
Will you guys grow up?

16
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,951
This is the most nature beautiful
thing in the world.

17
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,192
Yeah, we know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

18
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:07,526
This is my son having lunch, okay?
It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

19
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,401
If you're uncomfortable,
just ask questions.

20
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,298
Carol's fine with it.

21
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,138
Carol?

22
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,775
I'm wondering, could Joey ask you
a question about breast-feeding?

23
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,218
Sure.

24
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,155
Does it hurt?

25
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,927
It did at first, but not anymore.

26
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,385
Chandler?

27
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,333
So, how often can you do it?

28
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,400
As much as he needs.

29
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,695
Okay, I got one, I got one.

30
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,068
If he blows into one,
does the other one get bigger?

31
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,875
The One With the Breast Milk

32
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,193
- Any muffins left?
- Yeah, I forget which ones.

33
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,396
You're busy, I'll get it.

34
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,328
- Anyone else want one?
- No, thanks.

35
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,037
You're losing your apron.
Let me get it.

36
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,007
- There you go.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,540
What a bitch!

38
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,008
I have a friend at
Bloomingdale's who's quitting...

39
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,481
...and he wants to abuse his discount.

40
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,019
Anyone want to come
take advantage of it?

41
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,885
I have to take
my grandmother to the vet.

42
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,326
- I'll go with you.
- Great.

43
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,098
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, sweetums.

44
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,401
And hello to the rest.

45
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,806
You can't go shopping with her.
What about Rachel?

46
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,942
Will it be a problem?

47
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,242
You're going to
Bloomingdale's with Julie.

48
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,977
It's like cheating on Rachel
in her house of worship.

49
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,116
Monica, she will kill you.

50
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,489
She will kill you
like a dog in the street!

51
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,696
So Jules tells me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

52
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,932
It's actually not that big a deal.

53
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,267
It's a big deal to me.
This is great.

54
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,545
I really appreciate this.

55
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,280
You're welcome.

56
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,357
Bijan for men?

57
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,060
Bijan for men?

58
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,430
- Hey, Annabel.
- Hey, Joey.

59
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,798
Did you hear about the new guy?

60
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,477
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girls call him "The Hombre Man."

61
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,286
Hombre?

62
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,426
What's he doing in my section?

63
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,325
I guess he doesn't know.

64
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,190
Well, he's gonna.

65
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,293
I'll see you a little later, okay?

66
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,097
Hey, how you doing?

67
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,574
Mornin'.

68
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,378
Listen, I know you're new...

69
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,876
...but it's understood
that everything...

70
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,519
...from young men's to
the escalator is my territory.

71
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,246
"Your territory"?

72
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,286
- Bijan for men?
- No, thanks.

73
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,892
Hombre?

74
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,355
Yeah, all right.

75
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,195
You were saying?

76
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,178
Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping all day.

77
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,705
We shopped and we had lunch.

78
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,108
What did I have?

79
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,116
- You had a salad.
- No wonder I don't feel full.

80
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,448
Hi. What's up?

81
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,625
I went shopping with Monica
and I had a salad.

82
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,090
Good, Pheebs.
What'd you buy?

83
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,032
We went shopping for...

84
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,627
For...

85
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,833
For fur.

86
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,968
You went shopping for fur?

87
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,706
And then I realized
that I'm against that.

88
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,243
So then we bought some...

89
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,778
Boobs.

90
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,591
You bought boobs?

91
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,388
Bras!

92
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,358
We bought bras!

93
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,529
We bought bras.

94
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,004
Bijan for men?

95
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,136
Bijan for men?

96
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,776
Bijan for...

97
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,738
Hey, Annabel.

98
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:00,084
I was wondering if after work
we could grab a cup of coffee?

99
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,654
Actually, I sort of have plans.

100
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,552
You ready, Annabel?

101
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,363
You bet.

102
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,395
Maybe some other time.

103
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,105
It's not the first time I lost a girl
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

104
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,849
Bijan for men?

105
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,910
Bijan for men!

106
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,353
And this is Funny Clown.

107
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,026
It's only for after his naps,
not before, or he won't sleep.

108
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,695
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

109
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,229
We laugh, we play.
It's like we're father and son.

110
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,128
Honey, relax.
Ross is great with him.

111
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,274
Don't look so surprised.
I'm a lovely person.

112
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,074
This is so cute!

113
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,905
I got that for him!

114
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,683
"My Mommies Love Me."

115
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,145
That's clever.

116
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,487
Oh, hi, Jul...

117
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,328
Hi, Jew!

118
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,428
Okay, sure.

119
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,599
That'd be great.
See you then. Bye.

120
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,098
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?

121
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,636
Yes, I did.

122
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,941
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

123
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,290
Yeah, he likes it.
Reaffirms his faith.

124
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,702
Ben, dinner!

125
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,036
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

126
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,741
Did you microwave that?
You can't do that to breast milk.

127
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,876
I think I know
how to heat breast milk.

128
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,708
What did you just do?

129
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,713
I licked my arm, what?

130
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,148
It's breast milk!

131
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,649
So?

132
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,121
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

133
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,819
What is the big deal?

134
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,797
What did you just do?

135
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,304
Can people stop
drinking the breast milk?

136
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,500
You won't even taste it?

137
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,138
Not even if you just
pretend it's milk?

138
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,608
Not even if Carol's breast had
a picture of a missing child on it.

139
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,759
- Where is everybody?
- At the park. Where have you been?

140
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,330
Just out.

141
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,864
Had some lunch. Just me.
A little quality time with me.

142
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,965
- Thanks for your jacket.
- No problem.

143
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,037
You can borrow it, by the way.

144
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,107
Here are your keys, honey.

145
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,915
If you were at lunch alone,
how come it cost you $53?

146
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,223
You know what probably happened?

147
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,419
Someone stole my credit card.

148
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,758
And put the receipt
back in your pocket?

149
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,330
That is an excellent,
excellent question.

150
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,168
That is excellent.

151
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,405
What's with you?
Who did you have lunch with?

152
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,936
- Judy.
- Who?

153
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,177
- Julie.
- What?

154
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,775
Jody.

155
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,778
You were with Julie?

156
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,710
When it started, I was just
trying to be nice to her...

157
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,581
...because she was
my brother's girlfriend.

158
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,221
And then one thing
led to another...

159
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,362
...and before I knew it, we were...

160
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,364
...shopping.

161
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,235
Oh, my God!

162
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,304
Wait, we only did it once.

163
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,069
It didn't meant anything to me!

164
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,447
Rachal, I was thinking
of you the whole time.

165
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,618
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
I never meant for you to find out.

166
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,522
Oh, please! Please!
You wanted to get caught!

167
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,257
That is not true!

168
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,000
So you just happened
to leave it in here?

169
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,732
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

170
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,938
Okay, I just have to know one thing.

171
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,839
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?

172
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,891
Okay, I just really need
to not be with you right now.

173
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,802
Hi, who's this?

174
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,171
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
It's Monica.

175
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,478
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

176
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,613
Joanne, it's not
as simple as all that.

177
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,092
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

178
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,626
How did we do?

179
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,528
I tasted Ben's milk
and Ross freaked out.

180
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,531
I did not freak out.

181
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,003
- Why'd you freak out?
- Because it's breast milk.

182
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,940
It's gross!

183
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,412
My breast milk is gross?

184
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,249
This should be fun.

185
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,015
There's nothing wrong with it.

186
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,918
I just don't think
breast milk is for adults.

187
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,456
Of course, the packaging does
appeal to grownups and kids.

188
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,631
Don't be silly. I've tried it.
It's no big deal.

189
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:22,798
Just taste it.

190
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,434
That would be no.

191
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,328
- Come on.
- Try it.

192
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,471
It's natural.

193
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,039
It doesn't taste bad.

194
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,176
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of like...

195
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,209
Like what?

196
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,470
Cantaloupe juice.

197
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,080
Exactly.

198
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,814
You've tasted it.

199
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,993
You've tasted it.

200
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,127
Oh, you've tasted it.

201
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,236
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

202
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,576
Give me the bottle.

203
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,852
Get me the towel.

204
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,968
Howdy.

205
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,316
Give me a box of juice.

206
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,051
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

207
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,287
Maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

208
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,355
Or this guy's doing so good
they want to put more people on it.

209
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,932
This guy goes through
two bottles a day now.

210
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,703
What do you care?

211
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,802
You're an actor.
This is your day job. It's nothing!

212
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,543
I know, but I was the best.

213
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,871
You know? I liked being the best.

214
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,579
Maybe I should get
out of the game.

215
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,253
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

216
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,584
Say you do that.

217
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,887
Sooner or later, somebody will come
along that slices a better cheddar.

218
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,523
Then where you gonna run?

219
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,800
You're right.

220
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,369
I say you show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

221
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,201
Show him that you're the baddest
Hombre west of the lingerie!

222
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,002
- I'm gonna do it!
- All right!

223
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,812
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

224
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,611
I don't know what to say.

225
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,220
That's good because I'm not listening.

226
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,722
I feel terrible. I really do.

227
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,225
I'm sorry.
Did my back hurt your knife?

228
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,425
Say that I'm friends with her.
Is that so terrible?

229
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,939
- It's that terrible?
- You don't get it!

230
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,902
It's bad enough
she stole the guy...

231
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,667
...who may be the person
I'm supposed to be with.

232
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,112
But now...

233
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,015
...she's actually...

234
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,578
But now she's actually stealing you!

235
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,120
What are you talking about?

236
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,823
Nobody could steal me from you.

237
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:40,464
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any less friends with you.

238
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,333
You're my...

239
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,401
And we're...

240
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,441
- Oh, I love you!
- I love you too!

241
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:01,852
You guys, I know that this really
doesn't have anything to do with me.

242
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,645
But I love you guys too!

243
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:11,788
I really needed that.

244
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,633
I know that right now...

245
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,459
...you really need
to hate Julie's guts.

246
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,502
But she didn't do anything wrong.

247
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:26,110
She's just a girl who met a guy,
and now they go out.

248
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,848
I think that if you gave her
a chance, you'd like her.

249
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,976
Will you give it a chance?

250
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,149
For me?

251
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,516
I'd do anything for you,
you know that.

252
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,661
I'd do anything for you!

253
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,291
Wait, wait, wait!

254
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,746
Mornin'.

255
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,118
I said, mornin'!

256
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,750
I heard you.

257
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,455
All right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

258
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,059
You boys ready?

259
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,333
Ready.

260
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,503
Yeah, I'm ready.

261
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,584
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

262
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,991
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

263
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,820
Oh, my God! Todd!
What the hell did you do?

264
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,887
Sorry. I'm such a doofus!

265
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,496
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

266
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,362
My God, what happened?

267
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,803
These new kids, they never last.

268
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,473
Sooner or later they all...

269
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,872
...stop lasting.

270
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:44,070
What do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

271
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,517
Sure.

272
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,134
I just thought we should hang out.

273
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,239
I mean, you know,
we've never really talked.

274
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,569
I guess you'd know that,
being one of the two of us.

275
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,302
I know.

276
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,279
I probably shouldn't
even tell you this...

277
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,612
...but I'm pretty much
totally intimidated by you.

278
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:24,756
Really?

279
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,046
Me?

280
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,156
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

281
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,155
Ross is so crazy about you...

282
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,523
...and I really wanted you
to like me, and I...

283
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,665
It's probably me just
being totally paranoid...

284
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,394
...but I kind of got the feeling
that maybe you don't.

285
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,544
Well, you're not totally paranoid.

286
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,630
When you and Ross
first started going out...

287
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,128
...it was really hard for me...

288
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,435
...for many reasons of which
I'm not gonna bore you with now.

289
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,783
I see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

290
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,012
And Monica's always
saying how nice you are...

291
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,485
...and God, I hate it when she's right!

292
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,060
Thanks.

293
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:41,257
Would you like to go to
a movie sometime or something?

294
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,430
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love it.

295
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,398
I'd love it too.

296
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,734
Shoot, I gotta go.

297
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,909
- So I'll talk to you later.
- All right, Julie.

298
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,186
What a manipulative bitch.

299
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,282
It's not bad.

9999

{172}{198}So how was Joan?
{204}{236}Broke up with her.
{242}{262}Oh, why?
{268}{354}Don't tell me.|Because of the big nostril thing?
{360}{418}They were huge!
{424}{498}When she sneezed,|bats flew out of them.
{504}{548}They were not that huge.
{554}{669}I'm telling you, she leaned back,|I could see her brain.
{680}{720}How many women will you reject...
{726}{782}...over superficial,|insignificant things...
{788}{852}Hold it. I gotta side|with Chandler on this one.
{858}{920}When I first moved here,|I went out with this girl.
{926}{984}Really hot. Great kisser...
{990}{1084}...but she had the biggest|Adam's apple.
{1090}{1154}Drove me nuts.
{1156}{1218}- You or me?|- I got it.
{1224}{1322}Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
{1468}{1560}You guys are messing with me, right?
{1568}{1635}Yeah. We are!
{1641}{1752}That's a good one.|For a second there, I was like, whoa!

{1838}{1900}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{2920}{3048}You name one woman that you broke up|with for an actual real reason.
{3054}{3074}Maureen Rasillo.
{3080}{3205}Because she doesn't hate Yanni|is not a real reason.
{3276}{3334}Hello, Mr. Heckles.
{3340}{3374}You're doing it again.
{3380}{3407}We're not doing anything.
{3413}{3519}You're stomping.|It's disturbing my birds.
{3528}{3597}You don't have birds.
{3603}{3665}I could have birds.
{3671}{3716}We'll try to keep it down.
{3722}{3752}Thank you.
{3758}{3832}I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
{3838}{3920}All right, bye-bye.
{3921}{3944}Okay, Janice.
{3950}{4018}Give me Janice.|That wasn't about being picky.

{4506}{4600}There! Faster!
{4736}{4860}Stop with the broom!|We're not making noise!
{5064}{5092}We won.
{5098}{5170}We did it!
{5214}{5285}Mr. Heckles!
{5352}{5410}- How did this happen?|- He was sweeping.
{5416}{5505}They found a broom in his hand.
{5544}{5588}- That's terrible.|- I know.
{5594}{5642}I was sweeping yesterday.
{5648}{5725}It could've been me.
{5734}{5778}Sweeping. You never know.
{5784}{5848}Never know.
{5920}{6026}It's very faint, but I can|still sense him in the building.
{6032}{6135}Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
{6180}{6226}Okay, Phoebe.
{6232}{6321}I'm sorry,|but sometimes they need help.
{6342}{6364}Here we go.
{6370}{6428}That's fine, go ahead and scoff.
{6434}{6494}There are a lot of things|I don't believe in...
{6500}{6550}...but that doesn't mean|they're not true.
{6556}{6587}Such as?
{6593}{6737}Like crop circles or|the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.
{6794}{6848}What, you don't believe in evolution?
{6854}{6920}Not really.
{6948}{6990}You don't believe in evolution?
{6996}{7046}I don't know.|It's just, you know...
{7052}{7203}Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.|I just think it's a little too easy.
{7248}{7314}"Too easy"? Too...
{7320}{7401}The process of every living thing|on this planet evolving...
{7407}{7524}...over millions of years from|single-celled organisms is "too easy"?
{7530}{7594}Yeah, I just don't buy it.
{7600}{7701}Excuse me. Evolution is not|for you to buy, Phoebe.
{7707}{7798}Evolution is scientific fact,|like the air we breathe...
{7804}{7840}...like gravity.
{7846}{7938}Don't get me started on gravity.
{8029}{8096}You don't believe in gravity?
{8102}{8200}Well, it's not so much that,|you know, I don't believe in it.
{8206}{8250}Lately I get the feeling that...
{8256}{8334}...I'm not so much being pulled down|as I am being pushed.
{8340}{8401}Pushed.
{8420}{8513}It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.
{8554}{8628}There she is. And over there,|that's the other one.
{8634}{8688}This is Mr. Buddy Doyle,|Heckles' attorney.
{8694}{8724}He'd like to talk to you.
{8730}{8758}What can we do for you?
{8764}{8814}All right, kids, here's the deal.
{8820}{8868}According my client's will...
{8874}{8982}...he wants to leave|all his earthly possessions...
{8988}{9108}...to "the noisy girls|in the apartment above mine."
{9114}{9142}What about his family?
{9148}{9220}He didn't have any.
{9230}{9320}Okay, so let's talk money.
{9328}{9360}All right, there was none.
{9366}{9404}Now, let's talk signing.
{9410}{9523}You be noisy girl number one.|You be noisy girl number two.
{9526}{9600}I can't believe that this whole time|we thought he hated us.
{9606}{9690}Isn't it amazing how much|you can touch someone's life...
{9696}{9742}...without even knowing it?
{9748}{9782}Would you look at this dump?
{9788}{9844}He hated us!|This was his final revenge!
{9850}{9904}I've never seen so much crap!
{9910}{10014}Actually, I think this apartment|sullies the good name of crap.
{10020}{10095}Check this out.
{10106}{10172}Can I have this?
{10178}{10262}How can you not believe in evolution?
{10268}{10352}I don't know, just don't.|Look at this funky shirt!
{10358}{10426}Pheebs, I've studied evolution|my entire adult life.
{10432}{10514}And we've collected fossils|from all over the world...
{10520}{10602}...that actually show the evolution|of different species.
{10608}{10672}I mean, you can literally see them...
{10678}{10784}...evolving through time.
{10790}{10840}Really? You can actually see it?
{10846}{10968}You bet! In the U.S.,|China, Africa, all over!
{10974}{11026}See, I didn't know that.
{11032}{11120}Well, there you go.
{11126}{11281}So now the real question is,|who put those fossils there and why?
{11340}{11460}Look at this!|{y:i}My Big Book of Grievances.
{11488}{11536}Hey, there's me!
{11542}{11608}"April 17 th, excessive noise...
{11614}{11698}...Italian guy comes home with a date."
{11704}{11742}You're in here too.
{11748}{11804}"April 18th, excessive noise...
{11810}{11935}...Italian guy's gay roommate|brings home dry cleaning."
{12066}{12134}Well, that's excellent.
{12140}{12172}Look at this lamp.
{12178}{12258}Is this tacky or what?|We have to have this.
{12264}{12316}I think we have enough regular lamps.
{12322}{12372}What? Come on, it's not like...
{12378}{12444}...I'm asking for this|girlie clock or anything.
{12450}{12532}Which, by the way,|I also think is really cool.
{12538}{12620}Look, it doesn't go|with any of my stuff.
{12626}{12684}Well, what about my stuff?
{12690}{12746}You don't have any stuff.
{12752}{12855}You still think of it|as your apartment, don't you?
{12868}{12894}Yes, you do.
{12900}{13015}You think of it as your apartment|and I just rent a room.
{13048}{13182}While you "mmm" on that,|I'll go find a place for my new lamp.
{13226}{13348}Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making|these little toys move?
{13388}{13449}Opposable thumbs!
{13460}{13584}Without evolution, how do you|explain opposable thumbs?
{13590}{13712}Maybe the Overlords needed them|to steer their spacecrafts.
{13718}{13749}Tell me you're joking.
{13755}{13849}Look, can't we say that you believe|in something and I don't?
{13855}{13920}- No, Pheebs, we can't.|- Why not?
{13926}{14018}What is this obsessive need|to make everybody agree with you?
{14024}{14092}No, what's that all about?|You know what I think?
{14098}{14255}I think maybe it's time|you put Ross under the microscope.
{14323}{14409}Is there blood coming out of my ears?
{14434}{14528}Check it out.|Heckles' high-school yearbook.
{14534}{14567}He looks so normal!
{14573}{14620}He's even kind of cute.
{14626}{14681}"Heckles, you crack me up|in science class."
{14687}{14734}"You're the funniest kid in school."
{14740}{14820}- Funniest? Heckles?|- That's what it says.
{14826}{14940}Heckles was voted class clown,|and so was I.
{14950}{15003}He was right!|Would you listen to that?
{15009}{15081}I'd call that excessive.
{15087}{15106}What?
{15112}{15192}Heckles played clarinet in band,|and I played clarinet.
{15198}{15272}He was in the scale|modeler's club and I was...
{15278}{15356}There was no club,|but I sure thought they were cool.
{15362}{15428}So? You were both dorks.
{15434}{15460}Big deal.
{15466}{15544}I just think it's weird, you know?|Heckles and me...
{15550}{15596}Heckles and me. Me...
{15602}{15634}Me and Heckles.
{15640}{15730}Hey, would you knock it off!
{16146}{16186}Have you been here all night?
{16192}{16232}Look at this.
{16238}{16284}Pictures of all the women|Heckles went out with.
{16290}{16378}Look what he wrote on them.|"Vivian, too tall."
{16384}{16446}"Madge, big gums."
{16452}{16478}"Too loud."
{16484}{16532}"Too smart."|"Makes noise when she eats."
{16538}{16578}This is me.
{16584}{16665}This is what I do.
{16670}{16728}I'm gonna end up alone,|just like he did.
{16734}{16772}Heckles was a nut case.
{16778}{16824}Our trains are on the same track.
{16830}{16914}I'm coming up 30 years behind him,|but the stops are all the same.
{16920}{16962}Bitter Town...
{16968}{17066}...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!
{17068}{17124}You know what we gotta do?|Get you out of here.
{17130}{17170}I'll buy you breakfast.
{17176}{17244}What if I never find somebody?|Or worse, what if I found her...
{17250}{17354}...but I dumped her because|she pronounces it, "supposably"?
{17360}{17432}Chandler, come on,|you're gonna find somebody.
{17438}{17484}How do you know that? How?
{17490}{17574}I don't know. I'm just|trying to help you out.
{17580}{17624}You guys will all get married...
{17630}{17678}...and I'll end up alone.
{17684}{17724}Will you promise me something?
{17730}{17814}When you're married, will you|invite me over for holidays?
{17820}{17896}I don't know what we'll be doing.
{17932}{18045}I mean, what if we're over|at her folks' place?
{18062}{18150}Yeah, I understand.
{18190}{18248}You can come over|and watch the Super Bowl.
{18254}{18324}Every year, all right?
{18330}{18410}You know what?|I'm not gonna end up like this.
{18416}{18495}I'll see you, man.
{18690}{18760}"Supposably."
{18790}{18860}Supposably!
{18886}{18940}Did they go to the zoo?
{18946}{19035}Supposably.
{19300}{19392}Hi. It's me.
{19398}{19490}Oh, my God!
{19496}{19585}Janice? You called Janice?
{19590}{19616}Yes. Janice.
{19622}{19668}Why is that difficult to comprehend?
{19674}{19750}You remember Janice, right?
{19756}{19864}Yes. She was smart, she was pretty|and she honestly cared about me.
{19870}{19971}Janice is my last chance|to have somebody.
{20104}{20190}Oh, my God!
{20206}{20281}Jeez, look how fat she got.
{20294}{20382}- Hey, it's everybody!|- Hi, Janice.
{20388}{20416}Janice, you're...
{20422}{20482}Yes, I am.
{20488}{20532}- Is it...?|- Is it yours?
{20538}{20598}You wish, Chandler Bing!
{20604}{20735}You are looking at a married lady now.
{20810}{20854}Congratulations.
{20860}{20914}Sweetie, I'm sorry.
{20920}{20966}You couldn't tell me on the phone?
{20972}{21042}And what? Miss the expression|on your face? Oh, no!
{21048}{21150}Janice likes to have her fun!
{21410}{21478}You know what we haven't|played in a while?
{21484}{21560}Hide the lamp.
{21570}{21640}Monica, let it go.
{21646}{21688}Did you know|I'm allergic to shellfish?
{21694}{21805}Then you'll just have|to eat the other lamps.
{21844}{21943}It's scary scientist man.
{21970}{22012}Okay, Phoebe, this is it.
{22018}{22106}In this briefcase I carry|actual scientific facts.
{22112}{22214}A briefcase of facts, if you will.
{22228}{22350}Some of these fossils are|over 200 million years old.
{22356}{22434}Before you even start,|I'm not denying evolution.
{22440}{22488}It's just one of the possibilities.
{22494}{22542}It's the only possibility.
{22548}{22664}Ross, could you just open|your mind, like, this much?
{22672}{22788}Didn't the brightest minds in|the world believe the Earth was flat?
{22794}{22904}And up till 50 years ago, you thought|the atom was the smallest thing...
{22910}{23035}...until you split it open|and this whole mess of crap came out.
{23054}{23154}Are you telling me that you are|so unbelievably arrogant...
{23160}{23250}...that you can't admit that|there's a teeny, tiny possibility...
{23256}{23342}...that you could be wrong about this?
{23468}{23540}There might be...
{23546}{23618}...a teeny...
{23624}{23686}...tiny...
{23690}{23765}...possibility.
{23770}{23860}I can't believe you caved.
{23894}{24000}You just abandoned|your whole belief system!
{24006}{24090}Before, I didn't agree with you,|but at least I respected you.
{24096}{24130}But...
{24136}{24188}How are you gonna go|into work tomorrow?
{24194}{24260}How are you going to face|the other science guys?
{24266}{24370}How are you going to face yourself?
{24730}{24780}That was fun.|So who's hungry?
{24786}{24804}I am.
{24810}{24900}Me too.|Let me just get my coat.
{25060}{25117}What happened?
{25138}{25172}It was an accident, I swear.
{25178}{25272}I was putting on my jacket and|the thing and the lamp and it broke.
{25278}{25358}Oh, please, Monica!|You've always hated my lamp!
{25364}{25466}And now all of a sudden,|it's just magically, it's just broken?
{25472}{25500}Phoebe, tell her?
{25506}{25584}I didn't see it, because|I was putting on my jacket.
{25590}{25659}But I want to believe you.
{25730}{25830}Hey, Chandler. Monica just|broke my seashell lamp.
{25836}{25864}Neat.
{25870}{25950}I'm gonna die alone!
{25973}{26030}Okay, you win.
{26044}{26108}Chandler, you are not|gonna die alone.
{26114}{26158}Janice was my safety net, okay?
{26164}{26240}And now I have to get a snake.
{26260}{26280}Why is that?
{26286}{26366}If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,|I'm gonna need a thing.
{26372}{26410}You know, a hook.
{26416}{26500}Like that guy on the subway|who eats his own face.
{26506}{26555}So I figure I'll be|"Crazy Man With A Snake."
{26561}{26590}Crazy Snake Man.
{26596}{26644}Then I'll get more snakes,|call them my babies.
{26650}{26702}Kids will run past my place!
{26708}{26820}"Run away from Crazy Snake Man",|they'll shout!
{26868}{26932}You've got to get over this.
{26938}{26972}You won't end up alone.
{26978}{27016}Of course I will.
{27022}{27110}I reject anyone who's crazy enough|to actually go out with me...
{27116}{27240}...and then I bitch that there|aren't any great women out there.
{27268}{27299}You have just described...
{27305}{27428}...virtually every man|that we've ever gone out with.
{27438}{27527}You are not a freak.|You're a guy.
{27530}{27558}She's right.
{27564}{27605}You're no different than the rest.
{27611}{27662}Wait a minute, wait a minute.|Yes, he is.
{27668}{27711}You are totally different.
{27717}{27742}In a bad way?
{27748}{27789}No, honey, in a wonderful way.
{27795}{27836}You know what you want now.
{27842}{27880}Most guys don't even have a clue.
{27886}{27977}You're ready to take risks, be|vulnerable and intimate with someone.
{27983}{28044}You're not gonna end up alone.
{28050}{28209}You called Janice. That's how much|you wanted to be with someone!
{28214}{28260}- You've made it!|- You're there!
{28266}{28324}You are ready to make a commitment!
{28330}{28420}Don't know about that!
{28561}{28586}What you got there?
{28592}{28704}Something else that's not yours|that you can break?
{28738}{28808}I know you like this|and I want you to have it.
{28814}{28884}It'll look good in our apartment.
{28890}{28970}Thank you.
{29080}{29156}That's fine.
{29178}{29277}You'll all be pleased to know|that I have a date tomorrow night.
{29283}{29327}This woman Allison from work.|She is great.
{29333}{29408}She's pretty, she's smart.|And I've been...
{29414}{29514}...holding off asking her out|in the past, because she has a...
{29520}{29592}...unusually large head.
{29592}{29677}But I'm not going to let|that stuff hang me up anymore.
{29683}{29753}Look at me. I'm growing.
{29760}{29838}You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
{29844}{29872}I'll take that.
{29878}{29922}You want his yearbook?
{29928}{30014}Some people said nice things about him.|Somebody should have it.
{30020}{30080}Gosh, this is so weird.
{30086}{30188}His whole life was in|this apartment and now it's gone.
{30194}{30320}I think it would be nice if we just|took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.
{30326}{30454}He was kind of a pain.|He was, but he was a person.
{30580}{30621}You're all going to hell.
{30627}{30715}It's really not that big!
{30755}{30845}- Taking that with you, huh?|- Oh, yeah.
{30976}{31005}You coming?
{31011}{31073}In a second.
{31426}{31510}Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
{31552}{31640}We'll try to keep it down.
{31872}{31910}My major was useless.
{31916}{32012}How often do you look in the classifieds|and see "Philosopher Wanted"?
{32018}{32052}Sure.
{32058}{32150}{y:i}My God, that's a big head!
{32158}{32250}{y:i}It didn't look this big in the office.|{y:i}Maybe it's the lighting.
{32256}{32352}{y:i}My head must look|{y:i}like a golf ball at work.
{32358}{32450}{y:i}Don't get hung up on it. Quick!|{y:i}List five things you like about her.
{32456}{32502}{y:i}Nice smile, good dresser.
{32508}{32605}{y:i}Big head, big head, big head!

{140}{274}You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!
{279}{327}Don't cry.
{333}{419}Don't cry.
{424}{479}Why is he still crying?
{485}{534}Let me hold him for a sec.
{540}{599}Here we go.
{605}{662}There we are.
{670}{699}Maybe it's me.
{705}{798}Don't be silly. Ben loves you.|He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.
{804}{891}You know, I once dated|a Miss Cranky Pants.
{897}{972}Lovely girl. Kind of moody.
{978}{1028}There we go, all better.
{1034}{1119}There's my little boy.
{1237}{1329}Can I see something?
{1623}{1644}Cool!
{1650}{1710}He hates me.|My nephew hates me!
{1716}{1745}Come on, don't do this.
{1751}{1815}What if my own baby hates me?|What do I do then?
{1821}{1858}Monica, stop! This is nuts.
{1864}{1974}Do you know how long it'll be|before you have to deal with this?
{1980}{2079}You don't even have a boyfriend yet.
{2099}{2175}Joey, she does not look fat.

{3570}{3675}That is so funny!|Let me see that a sec.
{3822}{3841}You okay?
{3847}{3914}I don't know.
{3930}{3966}What's in this pie?
{3972}{4060}I don't know. Butter and eggs|and flour and lime and kiwi...
{4066}{4128}Kiwi? Kiwi?!
{4134}{4169}You said it was a key lime pie.
{4175}{4269}No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.|That's what makes it so special.
{4275}{4359}That's what's gonna kill me.
{4370}{4408}I'm allergic to kiwi.
{4414}{4539}No, you're not. You're allergic|to lobster and peanuts and...
{4557}{4586}Oh, my God!
{4592}{4649}It's definitely getting worse.
{4655}{4699}Is your tongue swelling up?
{4705}{4781}Either that or my mouth|is getting smaller!
{4787}{4839}Get your coat.|We're going to the hospital.
{4845}{4898}- Will he be okay?|- He's gotta get a shot.
{4904}{4983}You know, actually,|it's getting better. It is.
{4989}{5069}Let's not go.|Anyone up for Scrabble?
{5075}{5122}Jacket, now!
{5128}{5219}What about Ben? We can't|bring a baby to the hospital.
{5225}{5267}We'll watch him.
{5273}{5334}I don't think so.
{5340}{5449}I have seven Catholic sisters.|I've taken care of hundreds of kids.
{5455}{5501}Come on, we want to do it.|Don't we?
{5507}{5556}I was gonna play basketball...
{5562}{5631}...but I guess that's out the window.
{5637}{5711}If you take him out for a walk,|remember to bring his hat.
{5717}{5783}There's milk in the refrigerator|and diapers in the bag.
{5789}{5823}Hat, milk...
{5829}{5885}Got it!
{6078}{6117}Consider it done!
{6123}{6143}You understood?
{6149}{6254}My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
{6265}{6354}Is he the one|with the beautiful wife?
{6465}{6547}You want to hear the song|I'm singing this afternoon?

{6790}{6915}{y:i}Stop me if you've heard it
{6935}{7026}{y:i}My skin is soapy and my hair is wet
{7032}{7169}{y:i}And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget
{7224}{7359}Rachel, sweetheart,|could I see you for a minute?
{7413}{7451}What's up?
{7457}{7498}FYl:
{7504}{7603}I've decided to pay a professional|musician to play here on Sundays.
{7609}{7708}Her name is Stephanie something.|She's supposed to be very good.
{7714}{7779}But what about Phoebe?
{7785}{7867}It's not that your friend is bad.
{7873}{7959}It's that she's so bad...
{7960}{8073}...she makes me want to put my finger|through my eye into my brain...
{8079}{8155}...and swirl it around.
{8169}{8241}Okay, so you're not a fan.
{8247}{8354}But, I mean, come on.|You cannot do this to her.
{8413}{8449}I have to do this to her?
{8455}{8505}{y:i}Lather, rinse, repeat
{8511}{8563}{y:i}And lather, rinse, repeat
{8569}{8652}{y:i}And lather, rinse, repeat
{8658}{8735}{y:i}As needed
{8859}{8898}We didn't bring enough stuff.
{8904}{8964}Did you forget to pack|the baby's anvil?
{8970}{9023}I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.
{9029}{9088}It's a known fact|that women love babies.
{9094}{9199}Women love guys who love babies.|It's the sensitive thing.
{9205}{9309}Aim him at that pack of babes.|Maybe one of them will break away.
{9315}{9393}Wait, forget them.|We got one. Hard left.
{9399}{9443}- Give me the baby.|- No, I got him.
{9449}{9476}Come on, seriously.
{9482}{9564}Oh, seriously, you want him?
{9640}{9682}Who is this little cutie-pie?
{9688}{9752}Well, don't think me immodest, but...
{9758}{9821}...me.
{9827}{9849}Want to smell him?
{9855}{9942}I assume we're talking about the baby?
{9970}{10085}He's got that great baby smell.|Get a whiff of his head.
{10103}{10171}My uterus just skipped a beat.
{10177}{10205}What'd I tell you?
{10211}{10251}It's great you're doing this.
{10257}{10303}Well, we are great guys.
{10309}{10384}My brother and his boyfriend|have been trying to adopt.
{10390}{10484}What agency did you two go through?
{10559}{10596}But this is my gig.
{10602}{10636}This is where I play.
{10642}{10701}My name is written out there in chalk.
{10707}{10809}You know, you can't just erase chalk.
{10854}{10883}Honey, I'm sorry.
{10889}{10943}And he's going to|be paying this woman?
{10949}{11018}Why doesn't he just give her|a throne and a crown?
{11024}{11156}And, like, a gold stick|with a ball on top?
{11162}{11248}Terry is a jerk! That's why|we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"
{11254}{11349}That's where that came from.
{11379}{11463}You probably did everything you could.
{11469}{11599}You know what? Let me just|see what else I could do.
{11632}{11703}Just let her go on after|Stephanie whatever her name is.
{11709}{11773}You won't be here.|You don't pay her.
{11779}{11809}I don't know.
{11815}{11859}I'll clean the cappuccino machine!
{11865}{11958}You don't clean|the cappuccino machine?
{11960}{12028}Of course I clean it.
{12034}{12098}I mean, I will clean it.
{12104}{12141}I mean, I will clean it.
{12147}{12253}All right, fine, fine, fine!
{12337}{12369}- Done.|- Really?
{12375}{12423}Who's working for you, babe?
{12429}{12539}Oh, my God! This is so exciting!|How much am I gonna get?
{12545}{12581}What?
{12587}{12662}He's paying the people|who were playing.
{12668}{12791}I meant, he's paying that other woman|because she's a professional.
{12797}{12903}I'm not gonna be the only one|who's not getting paid.
{12908}{12943}I'm sorry, no!
{12949}{13052}No, I'm not some sloppy second,|you know, charity band.
{13058}{13118}There are thousands of places|in this city...
{13124}{13188}...where people would pay|to hear me play.
{13194}{13239}{y:i}When I play, I play for me
{13245}{13293}{y:i}I don't need your charity
{13299}{13369}Thank you!
{13530}{13608}I'm not getting a shot.|Maybe they can take the needle...
{13614}{13712}...and squirt it into my mouth.|Like a squirt gun.
{13718}{13778}Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.
{13784}{13873}I see someone's having|a little allergic reaction.
{13879}{13974}Doctor, can I see you|for just a moment?
{13988}{14078}My brother has|a slight phobia about needles.
{14084}{14189}Did you tell him|about my squirt gun idea?
{14192}{14248}My brother, the Ph.D.,|would like to know...
{14254}{14331}...if there's any way|to treat this orally?
{14337}{14457}Under these circumstances, it has to be|an injection, and it has to be now.
{14463}{14529}So?
{14555}{14644}Go and have a seat. The doctor|says it's got to be a needle.
{14650}{14799}You're just going to have to be brave.|Can you do that for me?
{14837}{14945}Oh, boy! You are doing so good.
{14951}{15014}You want to squeeze my hand?
{15020}{15068}Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
{15074}{15134}Honey, really.|Don't squeeze it so hard!
{15140}{15218}Let go of my hand!
{15268}{15327}Good plan. Next time|we want to pick up women...
{15333}{15399}...we should go to|the park and make out.
{15405}{15478}Taxi! Taxi!
{15495}{15562}Look at that talent.
{15607}{15656}Just practicing. You're good.
{15662}{15704}Carry on.
{15710}{15757}Wait, wait, wait!
{15763}{15838}Hey, you. He's just adorable.
{15844}{15982}Can you tell him that?|Because he thinks he looks too pink.
{15983}{16099}- What are you guys out doing today?|- We're not out.
{16103}{16173}We're two heterosexual guys|hanging with the son...
{16179}{16307}...of our other heterosexual friend,|doing the usual straight-guy stuff.
{16313}{16366}You done?
{16372}{16408}There's our stop.
{16414}{16477}Get out of here!|This is our stop.
{16483}{16529}You guys live around here too?
{16535}{16639}We live in the building|by the sidewalk.
{16659}{16718}You know it?
{16724}{16858}Since we're neighbors, what do you say|we get together for a drink?
{16940}{17008}So you want to go to Markel's?
{17014}{17061}Sure, they love us over there.
{17067}{17134}Where's your baby?
{17378}{17434}Ben! Ben!
{17440}{17523}That's good. Maybe he'll|hear you and pull the cord!
{17529}{17599}Stop the bus!
{17775}{17831}Are you sure he didn't break it?|It hurts.
{17837}{17929}No, it's just a good bone bruise.
{17935}{18046}And right here is|the puncture wound from your ring.
{18052}{18116}- I'm really sorry.|- It's okay.

{18343}{18414}Celebrate. Celebrate...
{18420}{18463}{y:i}He was a double, double
{18469}{18574}{y:i}Double-jointed boy
{18580}{18684}So are you the|professional guitar player?
{18690}{18736}Yeah, I'm Stephanie.
{18742}{18870}Right. My name was on there,|but now it just says carrot cake.
{18899}{18973}So how many chords do you know?
{18979}{19071}- All of them.|- So you know D?
{19087}{19151}Do you know A-minor?
{19190}{19287}Do you know how to go|from D to A-minor?
{19355}{19459}So does your guitar have a strap?
{19497}{19560}Mine does.
{19614}{19703}{y:i}Stephanie knows all the chords
{19730}{19809}Come on! Pick up, pick up!
{19813}{19866}Transit Authority?
{19872}{19911}I'm doing research for a book.
{19917}{20053}I was wondering what somebody might do|if they left a baby on a city bus.
{20059}{20123}Yes, I realize that would be|a stupid character.
{20129}{20191}Here's the deal:|We lost a car seat on a bus.
{20197}{20278}It's white plastic and|it fits onto a stroller.
{20284}{20354}And there was a baby in it.
{20360}{20427}He wants to talk to you.
{20438}{20518}Everybody, let's give a warm|Central Perk welcome to...
{20524}{20591}{y:i}Terry's a jerk|{y:i}And he won't let me work
{20597}{20679}{y:i}And I hate Central Perk
{20755}{20849}To Stephanie Schiffer!
{20935}{21079}I'd like to start with a song I wrote|for the first man I ever loved.
{21124}{21158}{y:i}Zachary...
{21164}{21269}{y:i}Are all invited to bite me
{21459}{21553}We're the guys that called|about the baby! Is he here?!
{21559}{21634}He's here.
{21659}{21698}I assume one of you is the father.
{21704}{21774}- That's me.|- I'm him.
{21802}{21939}Actually, we're both the father.
{22117}{22212}Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.
{22330}{22424}Please tell me you know|which one is our baby.
{22428}{22498}That one has ducks on his T-shirt|and this one has clowns.
{22504}{22553}And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
{22559}{22635}Or clowns.
{22643}{22752}That one's Ben! Remember he had|that cute little mole by his mouth!
{22758}{22836}Hey, Ben! Remember us?
{22842}{22915}Okay, the mole came off.
{22921}{22994}What are we gonna do?
{23000}{23043}We'll flip for it.|Ducks or clowns.
{23049}{23101}- Flip for the baby?|- You got a better idea?
{23107}{23182}All right, call it in the air.
{23188}{23214}Heads.
{23220}{23286}Heads, it is.
{23322}{23408}We have to assign heads to something!
{23414}{23484}Right!
{23513}{23639}Ducks is heads|because ducks have heads.
{23713}{23829}What kind of scary-ass clowns|came to your birthday?
{23960}{24065}{y:i}Just call me angel|{y:i}Of the morning, angel
{24071}{24183}{y:i}Just touch my cheek|{y:i}Before you leave me, baby
{24189}{24300}{y:i}Just call me angel|{y:i}Of the morning, angel
{24305}{24416}{y:i}Then slowly turn away
{24422}{24513}{y:i}I won't beg you to stay
{24519}{24614}{y:i}With me
{24824}{24888}Here. I thought you might be cold.
{24894}{24959}Thank you.
{25104}{25161}Look at you!|You did pretty well.
{25167}{25236}$8.27.
{25242}{25326}But not really, because|I put in the first two.
{25332}{25441}Just to get the ball rolling|and to make myself feel better.
{25447}{25510}Do you?
{25520}{25629}You know, this whole playing|for money thing is so not good for me.
{25635}{25737}I don't know, when I|sang "Su-su-suicide"...
{25743}{25833}...I got, like, $ 1.75.
{25839}{25920}But then "Smelly Cat"?
{25929}{26034}I got 25 cents and a condom.
{26034}{26159}So, you know, now I just feel|really bad for "Smelly Cat".
{26185}{26283}Honey, I don't think|everybody gets "Smelly Cat".
{26289}{26448}I mean, if all you've ever actually|had are healthy pets, then whoosh!
{26457}{26513}But it's not even that, you know?
{26519}{26586}I used to do my songs|because it made me happy.
{26592}{26722}Now it's just all|about the money, you know?
{26750}{26801}Well, people missed you in there.
{26807}{26887}In fact, there was actually|a request for "Smelly Cat".
{26893}{26936}Really? From who?
{26942}{27008}Well, me.
{27013}{27149}And I know it's not your big|money song, but it's my favorite.
{27205}{27334}Did I accidentally drop|a condom in your case?
{27387}{27463}It's kind of an emergency.
{27469}{27503}- Here you go.|- Thanks a lot.
{27509}{27598}Hey, Christine! I got it!
{27715}{27781}I want to thank you|for being there for me.
{27787}{27843}And I'm sorry|I almost broke your hand.
{27849}{27956}That's okay.|I'm sorry I poisoned you.
{27962}{28043}Remember the time I jammed|that pencil into your hand?
{28049}{28169}Remember it? What do|you think this is, a freckle?
{28175}{28266}What about the time I hit you|in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?
{28272}{28333}Remember when I stuck|that broom in your spokes...
{28339}{28429}...and you hit your head on the curb?
{28433}{28524}But I remember|people telling me about it.
{28532}{28616}I hope Ben has a little sister.
{28624}{28707}And I hope she can kick his ass.
{28708}{28771}I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.
{28777}{28858}How about the time I cut|the legs off your Malibu Ken?
{28864}{28932}That was you?
{28958}{29067}They were infected.|He wouldn't have made it.
{29131}{29163}My little nephew.
{29169}{29222}Come here, little one!
{29228}{29359}There's my little baby, Ben!
{29418}{29510}Hey, he's not crying!
{29565}{29659}Hey, he's not crying!
{29767}{29833}There's still pie!
{29839}{29904}I'm here. I'm here.
{29910}{29964}How's my little boy?
{29970}{30083}You want Daddy to change|your diaper? I know, I know.
{30089}{30199}Did you have fun with Uncle Joey|and Uncle Chandler today?
{30205}{30299}He rode the bus today.
{30352}{30434}Big boy riding the bus...
{30440}{30519}Hey, I have a question.
{30545}{30654}How come it says,|"Property of Human Services"?
{30738}{30812}You are gonna love this.
{30818}{30869}Can you hold Ben for a sec?
{30875}{30898}Come here. Come here.
{30904}{31014}Stay back! I've got kiwi!|Run, Joey, run!

{31495}{31593}{y:i}Smelly cat, smelly cat
{31599}{31623}Better!
{31629}{31653}Much better. Good.
{31659}{31760}Don't feel bad,|because it's a hard song.
{31778}{31833}- You want to try it again?|- From the top?
{31839}{31913}There is no "top", all right?
{31919}{32006}That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat".
{32048}{32115}Why don't you just follow me.
{32121}{32206}{y:i}Smelly cat, smelly cat
{32212}{32288}{y:i}What are they feeding you?
{32294}{32368}{y:i}Smelly cat, smelly cat

{1385}{1469}So who else did you tip|with cookies?

{6694}{6818}My mother gave me this picture|before she died. Same guy!

{7000}{7069}It's not a blue screen.|It's just...
{7075}{7178}Maybe it was just|really clear that day.

{7939}{7989}Hi, Gram. What you doing?
{7995}{8084}Just updating the phone book.
{8090}{8139}Gram?
{8145}{8235}Can I see the pictures|of my dad again?
{8250}{8313}Sure, sure.
{8319}{8338}How come?
{8344}{8406}Just, you know, to see him.
{8412}{8482}Sure. Here.
{8499}{8586}This is the one|of your father in a meadow.
{8592}{8686}And helping a little boy fly a kite.
{8692}{8795}And here he is at a graduation.
{8797}{8872}Another graduation.
{8905}{8985}Another graduation.
{8995}{9044}Is this really my father?
{9050}{9128}Is it really your fa...?
{9134}{9189}Well, of course it is.
{9195}{9313}I smell smoke. Maybe because|someone's pants are on fire!
{9333}{9403}In all the years we've been|grandmother and granddaughter...
{9409}{9467}...you've never lied.
{9473}{9614}All right, that's not your father.|It's a picture of a guy in a frame.
{9635}{9672}Oh, God.
{9678}{9728}It was your mother's idea.
{9734}{9791}She didn't want you|to know your real father...
{9797}{9851}...because he hurt her so much.
{9857}{9895}I didn't want to do it.
{9901}{10018}But then she died|and it was harder to argue with her.
{10027}{10101}Not impossible, but harder.
{10107}{10228}All right. So he's not|a famous tree surgeon?
{10297}{10414}And I guess he doesn't live in a hut|in Burma where there's no phones?
{10420}{10493}Last I heard, he was|a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
{10499}{10537}That makes no sense.
{10543}{10654}Why would the villagers|worship a pharmacist?
{10665}{10732}Honey.
{10777}{10886}Anyway, that's all I know.
{10910}{10973}That...
{10989}{11061}...and this.
{11104}{11147}This...
{11153}{11235}...is the real him.
{11319}{11394}I remember my father|all dressed up in the red suit...
{11400}{11474}...the big black boots|and the patent leather belt...
{11480}{11551}...sneaking around downstairs.|He didn't want us to see him...
{11557}{11668}...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash|into something and wake everybody up.
{11674}{11748}That doesn't sound like|a very merry Christmas.
{11754}{11841}Who said anything about Christmas?
{11895}{11940}Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
{11946}{11977}No, nothing.
{11983}{12014}I hope she's okay.
{12020}{12079}I know exactly|what she's going through.
{12085}{12132}How do you know that?
{12138}{12208}She told us.
{12253}{12294}What do you got there, Monica?
{12300}{12328}Stuff for the party.
{12334}{12402}Aren't you guys|supposed to be shopping?
{12408}{12446}You didn't buy presents yet?
{12452}{12517}Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!|What are you gonna do?
{12523}{12629}Don't you have to be|Claymation to say that?
{12640}{12707}I don't think the mailman|liked your cookies.
{12713}{12794}The ornaments your mom sent.
{12870}{12964}Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.|We just didn't give him enough.
{12970}{13075}Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.
{13237}{13264}Hey, Rach.
{13270}{13339}I think I know what will|make you feel better.
{13345}{13409}How about you make a list about me?
{13415}{13468}Forget it.|I'm not gonna stand here...
{13474}{13501}...and make a list...
{13507}{13553}Okay, you're whiny...
{13559}{13636}...you are obsessive,|you are insecure...
{13642}{13674}...you're gutless.
{13680}{13729}You don't ever just "seize the day".
{13735}{13831}You liked me for a year|and you didn't do anything about it.
{13837}{13950}And you wear too much|of that gel in your hair.
{14000}{14039}See, there...
{14045}{14109}All right, you did what I said.
{14115}{14188}And you know what?|You're right. I do feel better.

{14665}{14717}Oneonta?
{14723}{14840}You know what? You shouldn't|call yourself Information!
{14957}{15057}Hello, Grandma. If that is,|in fact, your real name.
{15063}{15166}Come on now, Pooh.|Don't still be mad at me.
{15172}{15256}- How's it going?|- Not so good.
{15262}{15361}Upstate's pretty big.|He's pretty small. You do the math.
{15367}{15449}Well, I think you're|better off without him.
{15455}{15505}Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.
{15511}{15586}But to me, he's still|the irresponsible creep...
{15592}{15708}...who locked up your mom|and stole her Gremlin.
{15714}{15850}I know. I just wanted to know|who he was, you know?
{15864}{15935}Yeah, I know.
{15965}{16060}I wasn't completely honest with you|when I said I didn't know...
{16066}{16122}...exactly where he lived.
{16128}{16166}What do you mean?
{16172}{16306}He lives at 74 Laurel Drive|in Middletown.
{16325}{16385}If you hit the Dairy Queen,|you've gone too far.
{16391}{16472}You can take my cab.
{16483}{16545}Thank you.

{16838}{16915}Wish me luck, Grandpa.
{17125}{17163}Phoebe here with the cab yet?
{17169}{17219}Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.
{17225}{17269}Hop in!
{17275}{17338}She'd better get here.|The stores close at 7.
{17344}{17410}It'll be two hours|to Phoebe's dad's house...
{17416}{17465}...they'll meet, chat,|swap life stories.
{17471}{17548}We'll have plenty of time.
{17548}{17630}Hey, here she comes!
{17797}{17826}Can you believe this?
{17832}{17924}In, like, two hours|I'm gonna have a dad.
{17930}{17967}Yeah, big stuff!
{17973}{18002}Okay, let's go!
{18008}{18092}Here, you have to hold this.
{18138}{18201}"Brake, left. Gas, right"?
{18207}{18275}That's my cheat sheet.
{18332}{18398}- Where's my seat belt?|- There isn't one.
{18404}{18495}The paramedics had to cut through it.
{18750}{18819}Come on, just tell me.|Please, please!
{18825}{18955}For the 16th time:|No, I do not think you're obsessive!
{18962}{19027}- It's hot in here!|- Rach, get the heat.
{19033}{19094}Ross, turn the heat down, please?
{19100}{19151}The difference between obsessive...
{19157}{19183}Ross, the heat!
{19189}{19320}Okay! Heat, heat, heat!|And I'm the obsessive one?
{19337}{19383}This way is on.
{19389}{19480}So this is...
{19505}{19567}...off.
{19570}{19622}Did you just break the radiator?
{19628}{19696}No, I was turning the knob and...
{19702}{19751}...here it is.
{19757}{19840}Well, put it back!
{19880}{19920}It won't go back.
{19926}{19951}I'll call the super.
{19957}{19989}Here, let me try.
{19995}{20098}That's right. I forgot about|your ability to fuse metal.
{20104}{20143}Hey, it's Funny's cousin...
{20149}{20179}...Not Funny!
{20185}{20216}Hi, Mr. Treeger?
{20222}{20268}It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.
{20274}{20346}Yes, somebody broke our knob|on the radiator...
{20352}{20428}...and it's really hot in here.
{20434}{20533}Yes, it's hot enough|to bake cookies.
{20558}{20626}Could we have a new one by 6?
{20632}{20689}Tuesday?|We can't wait until Tuesday.
{20695}{20732}We're having a party tonight.
{20738}{20773}Okay, tip the man.
{20779}{20833}If he doesn't like|our cookies, too bad.
{20839}{20869}I won't be blackmailed.
{20875}{20929}Look, if it gets a little warm...
{20935}{20974}...it can be a theme party.
{20980}{21084}Here's a theme:|"Come on in, live like bacon!"
{21125}{21153}This is it!
{21159}{21222}Seventy-four.
{21245}{21327}So that's what this is for!
{21333}{21402}This is it.|I'm gonna meet my dad.
{21408}{21472}This is like|the biggest thing ever.
{21478}{21512}Sure is.
{21518}{21557}Here I go. I'm going in.
{21563}{21584}All right!
{21590}{21666}Good luck, Pheebs.
{21670}{21745}Here I go.
{21753}{21825}Here I go.
{21829}{21900}I'm going.
{22185}{22248}Welcome to our tropical|Christmas party.
{22254}{22376}Put your coats, sweaters,|pants and shirts in the bedroom.
{22398}{22455}It's hard to tell|because I'm sweating...
{22461}{22571}...but I use exactly|what the gel bottle says.
{22594}{22737}An amount about the size of a pea.|How can that be too much?
{22767}{22802}Ice?
{22808}{22930}Ice? Ice squares anyone?|Take a napkin.
{22945}{23011}Monica!
{23014}{23073}Your guests are turning into jerky.
{23079}{23144}Really?|I'm perfectly comfortable.
{23150}{23246}Hey! Get in line, buddy.|I was next.
{23319}{23350}Mr. Treeger.
{23356}{23427}You said there was a party.
{23430}{23484}Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.
{23490}{23564}Is it hot?|My body always stays cool.
{23570}{23646}Probably because I have so much skin.
{23652}{23730}Hey, cheese!
{23734}{23798}Here's the chance.|Monica, give him cash.
{23804}{23878}Rachel, give him your earrings.|Something. Anything!
{23884}{23921}No, I will not cave.
{23927}{23948}I'm with Mon.
{23954}{24034}All right. You know how you say|I never seize the day?
{24040}{24156}Even though he's your super,|I'm seizing.
{24165}{24219}Mr. Treeger?
{24225}{24324}Here is $50.|Merry Christmas.
{24325}{24378}I didn't get you anything.
{24384}{24444}Here's five back.
{24450}{24516}No, that's your Christmas tip.
{24522}{24629}Do you think there's a chance|you can fix that radiator now?
{24635}{24689}No can do.|Like I told the girl...
{24695}{24752}...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.
{24758}{24794}Ross?
{24800}{24839}He's playing baseball.
{24845}{24920}You mean hardball?
{24970}{25008}Whatever.
{25014}{25038}What you gonna do?
{25044}{25094}Excuse me. I'm seizing.
{25100}{25156}Mr. Treeger?
{25162}{25204}Here's another 50.
{25210}{25246}Happy Hanukkah.
{25252}{25364}Will this help|with the knob-getting?
{25365}{25439}No, the place is not open|till Tuesday.
{25445}{25521}Am I not saying it right?
{25527}{25584}So you really did like my cookies?
{25590}{25718}Yeah, they were so personal.|It really showed you cared.
{25814}{25853}Nice seizing...
{25859}{25935}...gel boy.
{26009}{26093}Is this mistletoe?
{26105}{26144}No, that...
{26150}{26230}That is basil.
{26283}{26392}If it was mistletoe,|I was gonna kiss you.
{26410}{26487}No, it's still basil.
{26514}{26660}{y:i}Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
{26679}{26810}{y:i}Jack Frost nipping at your nose
{26833}{26873}- How far did you get?|- Mailbo x.
{26879}{26980}All right, we're getting closer.
{26985}{27028}What's going on?
{27034}{27099}It's just like|a whole mess of stuff.
{27105}{27214}Like yesterday, my dad was|this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.
{27220}{27301}And you know, now he's|a pharmacist guy and...
{27307}{27405}Well, maybe he's this|really cool pharmacist guy.
{27411}{27514}Yeah, maybe!|And I'll knock on the door...
{27520}{27597}...and he'll hug me,|and I'll have a dad!
{27603}{27691}I'll go to his pharmacy and|everyone will be nice to me...
{27697}{27763}...because, you know,|I'm Frank's daughter.
{27769}{27839}So why not go knock?
{27894}{28023}Because, I mean, what if|he's not this great-dad guy?
{28029}{28175}What if he's still the dirtbag|who ran out on my mom and us?
{28259}{28302}You know what?
{28308}{28403}I've already lost|a fake dad this week.
{28409}{28505}I don't think I'm ready|to lose a real one.
{28528}{28654}Pheebs, that's okay.|You took a big step today.
{28687}{28771}Someday, when you're ready,|you'll make it past the hedges.
{28777}{28864}And when you do,|he'll be lucky to have you.
{28870}{28943}You guys...
{29007}{29043}Sorry about your shopping.
{29049}{29155}Oh, that's okay.|We'll figure something out.
{29183}{29235}I know you're not going in there...
{29241}{29342}...but you think it's okay|if I go in and use his bathroom?
{29348}{29430}That's fine, never mind.
{29435}{29471}Cool, snow!
{29477}{29560}Kind of like a blank canvas.
{29765}{29876}Ho-ho-ho-holy crap,|is it hot in here!
{29895}{29944}You mind if I turn the heat down?
{29950}{30031}We could have used|that kind of thinking earlier!
{30037}{30081}So, Pheebs, how did it go?
{30087}{30139}Oh, I couldn't go in.
{30145}{30191}- Honey, I'm sorry.|- Are you okay?
{30197}{30262}Yeah, it's okay,|because I know he's there.
{30268}{30313}So that's enough for now.
{30319}{30394}Hey, it's after midnight!|Merry Christmas, everyone!
{30400}{30507}Oh, right! Merry Christmas!
{30523}{30553}The knob was broken...
{30559}{30680}...so I turned it off from underneath.|I hope that's all right.
{30943}{31009}Rach, these are for you.
{31015}{31064}Wiper blades!
{31070}{31110}I don't even have a car.
{31116}{31250}No, but with this new-car smell,|you'll think you do!
{31285}{31370}Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
{31432}{31509}Toilet-seat covers!
{31547}{31614}Is that what you did|while I got gas?
{31620}{31679}You guys!
{31685}{31713}And for Ross...
{31719}{31796}...Mr. Sweet Tooth.
{31850}{31919}You got me a cola drink?
{31925}{32005}And a lemon-lime!
{32018}{32171}Well, this is too much! I feel like|I should get you another sweater.

{1008}{1070}All right?|Pheebs, read yours.
{1076}{1162}"The only thing worse than|the mindless, adolescent direction..."
{1168}{1254}Anybody have a different paper?
{1254}{1293}Ross, read yours.
{1299}{1369}I don't want to.
{1371}{1457}Joey, they don't know|what they're talking about.
{1463}{1488}Maybe they do.
{1494}{1592}I've done this 10 years and I'm|nowhere. There's gotta be a reason.
{1598}{1652}Come on, you're just|paying your dues.
{1658}{1709}No, no, no. It's too hard.
{1715}{1760}It's not worth it. I quit.
{1766}{1795}Come on, Joey!

{3296}{3343}I used to want to be a vet.
{3349}{3467}Then I found out you have|to put your hands into cows.
{3558}{3583}Are you okay?
{3589}{3651}Just a tough day at work, you know?
{3657}{3749}Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.
{3781}{3847}I know this jacket.|This is Fun Bobby's jacket!
{3853}{3903}Where is he?|He's here, isn't he?
{3909}{3958}- Maybe.|- Don't toy with me.
{3964}{3983}Geller!
{3989}{4028}Hey, Fun Bobby!
{4034}{4077}Hey! You been working out?
{4083}{4108}Not at all.
{4114}{4177}I love this guy!
{4183}{4240}I'm psyched to hear|you're back with Monica.
{4246}{4296}- You and me both!|- So what'd I miss?
{4302}{4370}We were trying|to make Joey feel better.
{4376}{4413}Need me to pick you up?
{4419}{4453}No, I'm all right, man.
{4459}{4492}No, I'm picking you up!
{4498}{4589}No, seriously.|I don't need you to...
{4617}{4648}It still works!
{4654}{4755}Before I go, does anybody else|need to be picked up?
{4761}{4812}I'm still gonna go.
{4818}{4887}See you later, babe.
{4901}{5029}Public display of affection coming up.|You can avert your eyes.
{5168}{5226}See you.
{5228}{5265}Fun Bobby is so great.
{5271}{5298}Oh, isn't he?
{5304}{5415}I think this time it may work with him.|He makes me feel so good.
{5421}{5500}I've been feeling so lousy lately.|No job, no boyfriend.
{5506}{5572}Well, at least my cup is half full.
{5578}{5665}Half full of love!
{5688}{5777}For our two-week anniversary,|he's taking me to his cousin's cabin.
{5783}{5867}Cabin of love!
{5882}{5937}We went through|a lot of wine tonight.
{5943}{5972}I only had two glasses.
{5978}{6003}I had a glass.
{6009}{6028}Two.
{6034}{6053}I had one glass.
{6059}{6093}I had a mug full in this...
{6099}{6209}...I-got-boned-at-the-|Museum-of-Natural-History mug.
{6218}{6278}Okay, so that's what?|Two bottles.
{6284}{6379}And yet somehow we went through five?
{6648}{6728}So what?|So he drank a lot tonight.
{6734}{6793}Now that I think about it,|I don't think...
{6799}{6903}...I've ever seen Fun Bobby|without a drink.
{6908}{6995}And did you notice how|he always starts his stories with...
{7001}{7113}..."Okay, I was so wasted!"|or "Oh, we were so bombed!"
{7119}{7227}"So I wake up and I'm in|this dumpster in Connecticut!"
{7242}{7307}Have you been with him|when he wasn't drinking?
{7313}{7401}We just happen to go to a lot|of places where you might drink.
{7407}{7488}How do you go to a wine-tasting|without having a drink?
{7494}{7553}Or to a club, or to the...
{7559}{7625}...zoo.
{7707}{7770}Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
{7776}{7862}I don't know, taste it.
{7919}{8001}Too late, you already had some.
{8047}{8162}What do you say|we make these coffees Irish?
{8214}{8266}Cake!
{8272}{8371}Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.
{8394}{8492}It seems like you've been making|an awful lot of stuff "Irish" lately.
{8498}{8639}I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles|are hard to get into that flask.
{8652}{8691}Yeah, okay.
{8697}{8813}Maybe it's none of my business.|Or maybe it is, I don't know.
{8819}{8868}I'm worried about you.
{8874}{8978}This isn't the first time somebody|said something to me about this.
{8984}{9073}But I always made excuses,|like "I'm just a social drinker."
{9079}{9175}Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!"
{9189}{9269}So, what are you saying now?
{9269}{9313}I guess I'm saying...
{9319}{9360}...I'll try and quit.
{9366}{9446}I like that you worry about me.
{9497}{9548}So, what's going on?
{9554}{9604}I am gonna try and quit drinking.
{9610}{9685}Oh! Why?
{9819}{9882}Guess who's back in show biz!
{9888}{9947}Lorne Greene?
{9977}{10027}No. You know why?|Because he's dead.
{10033}{10099}Oh, no.
{10114}{10167}This is gonna seem bittersweet now...
{10173}{10251}...but Joey, that's who!
{10257}{10339}My agent called with an audition|for "Days Of Our Lives"!
{10345}{10392}Kick ass!
{10398}{10479}We have to celebrate!|We should do a soap opera theme.
{10485}{10605}We could all sleep together,|then one of us could get amnesia!
{10669}{10748}When do you get off?|We'll do something tonight.
{10754}{10865}Well, actually, I'm already done.|But I kind of got plans.
{10871}{10945}You have other friends?
{10968}{11003}I have a date.
{11009}{11027}What?
{11033}{11085}With a man?
{11091}{11143}What's so strange|about me having a date?
{11149}{11177}What about Ross?
{11183}{11242}You're still mad|because he made that list?
{11248}{11305}No, no, I'm not mad at him.
{11311}{11373}I'm not really "anything"|at him anymore.
{11379}{11474}- What are you talking about?|- I don't know.
{11474}{11538}Whatever I was feeling, I'm...
{11544}{11563}...not.
{11569}{11607}But you guys came so close.
{11613}{11686}I'm sorry. You'll have|to get used to the fact...
{11692}{11779}...that I will not be dating Ross.
{11790}{11854}Here he is.
{11854}{11945}Guys, this is Russ.
{12238}{12316}I'm not saying you're not talented.|You're very talented.
{12322}{12424}But with the bird dead and all,|there's very little act left.
{12430}{12484}Honey, give me a break, will you?
{12490}{12522}I'll talk to you later.
{12528}{12572}There's my favorite client!
{12578}{12640}So tell me, darling,|how was the audition?
{12646}{12740}I think it went well.|I got a callback for Thursday.
{12746}{12847}Joey! Have you ever|seen me ecstatic?
{12853}{12929}Well, here it is.
{12995}{13087}Okay! Listen, there's something|I want to talk to you about.
{13093}{13118}The casting lady...
{13124}{13173}Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
{13179}{13238}She's great.
{13243}{13348}But I kind of got the feeling that|she was sort of coming on to me.
{13354}{13495}And I definitely would get the part|if I were to, you know...
{13558}{13659}If I sent the little general in.
{13680}{13770}I see! Well, I'm just gonna|put in a call here...
{13776}{13883}...and we'll find out what's going on|and straighten it out.
{13889}{13960}Lori, please.
{13974}{14018}Hi, darling!
{14024}{14094}How about Joey Tribbiani|for the part of the cab driver?
{14100}{14179}Isn't he terrific?
{14251}{14303}Okay, doll, talk to you later.
{14309}{14397}You're gonna have to sleep with her.
{14457}{14501}- What's the matter?|- Fun Bobby.
{14507}{14538}What? Isn't he sober?
{14544}{14577}Oh, he's sober all right.
{14583}{14686}Turns out that Fun Bobby|was fun for a reason.
{14768}{14836}All right, here you go, sweetie.
{14842}{14903}Thanks. You wanna|hear something funny?
{14909}{14984}Oh, God, yes!
{14986}{15128}There are no hardware stores open|past midnight in the Village.
{15164}{15223}That is funny.
{15229}{15342}I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out|walking around the neighborhood.
{15348}{15380}But apparently...
{15386}{15538}...there are no hardware stores open|past midnight in the Village.
{15625}{15677}Don't you have to|be at your interview?
{15683}{15741}Oh, yeah.
{15784}{15811}See you guys.
{15817}{15852}Bye...
{15858}{15937}...ridiculously dull Bobby.
{15943}{15974}Oh, my God.
{15980}{16010}He's not that bad.
{16016}{16110}Not that bad?|Did you not hear the hammer story?
{16116}{16205}Okay, don't get all squinky.
{16209}{16275}Maybe it's the kind of story|where you had to be there.
{16281}{16313}But I'm gonna be there!
{16319}{16406}For the rest of my life.
{16412}{16498}I can't dump him. I made him|quit drinking. I made him dull!
{16504}{16531}Don't say that.
{16537}{16618}He's probably always been dull.|You just, you know...
{16624}{16692}...set it free.
{16716}{16773}Hey, Ross.
{16799}{16822}Hi, Russ.
{16828}{16902}I've got two more tables|to clean, and then we'll go.
{16908}{16966}I'll just sit here and...
{16972}{17032}...chat with your...
{17038}{17149}...friend-type people.
{17242}{17299}Rachel?
{17313}{17378}So, you know what|you're doing, right?
{17384}{17412}Waitressing?
{17418}{17491}Well, yeah. But, no.|I mean...
{17497}{17605}Doesn't Russ just|remind you of someone?
{17613}{17650}Bob Saget?
{17656}{17704}Oh, yeah!
{17710}{17771}No, no, no!
{17777}{17821}Oh, my, oh!
{17827}{17885}What's wrong?
{17893}{17922}She's upset because...
{17928}{18036}...she buttered a spider|into her toast this morning.
{18044}{18109}All right.
{18126}{18195}Listen, Pheebs.|This is gonna be okay.
{18201}{18284}Ross, Russ.|Russ, Ross.
{18346}{18395}Are you a friend of Rachel's?
{18401}{18425}Yes. Yes, I am.
{18431}{18494}Are you a friend of Rachel's?
{18500}{18570}Actually, I'm kind of a...
{18576}{18609}...you know...
{18615}{18686}...a date-type thing...
{18692}{18731}...of Rachel's.
{18737}{18776}A date?
{18782}{18810}I'm her date.
{18816}{18858}Oh! Oh, you're a...
{18864}{18930}Oh, you're the date.
{18936}{18967}This is actually good...
{18973}{19053}...because if we lose Ross,|we have a spare.
{19059}{19128}Oh! You are the paleontologist.
{19134}{19244}Yes. Yes, I am.|And you are a...
{19256}{19278}Periodontist.
{19284}{19371}See? Now they're as|different as night and...
{19377}{19420}...later that night.
{19426}{19512}Well, I am going to get a beverage.
{19518}{19567}It was nice meeting you.
{19573}{19634}Ditto.
{19749}{19817}Well, I met Russ.
{19846}{19918}Hey, I didn't know|we were seeing other people.
{19924}{20008}Well, we're not|seeing each other, so...
{20014}{20083}For your information,|there's a woman at the museum...
{20089}{20185}...who's curator of moths and other...
{20191}{20248}...winged things...
{20268}{20365}...who's let it be known that|she is drawn to me, much like a...
{20371}{20428}...you know.
{20429}{20496}I've kept her at bay,|but if this is the deal...
{20502}{20530}This is the deal.
{20536}{20600}Okay, well, have a nice evening.
{20606}{20674}Russ, you ready?
{20811}{20856}She's dating?
{20862}{20887}She's dating?
{20893}{20980}Yes, but did you see|who she was dating?
{20986}{21017}What do you mean?
{21023}{21064}- Do you not see it?|- See what?
{21070}{21174}I don't know what she sees|in that goober!
{21204}{21277}It takes him, what?|Like, I don't know...
{21283}{21364}...hello, a week|to get out a sentence?
{21370}{21440}It's annoying, isn't it?
{21793}{21832}You didn't get the part...
{21838}{21912}...or Italy called|and said it was hungry?
{21918}{21973}The part's mine if I want it.
{21979}{22000}Oh, my God!
{22006}{22072}If I'm willing to sleep|with the casting lady.
{22078}{22105}Oh, my...
{22111}{22162}...God?
{22168}{22257}Ten years I've been waiting|for a break like this. Ten years!
{22263}{22368}I mean, "Days of our Lives".|That's actually on television!
{22374}{22407}What are you gonna do?
{22413}{22473}I guess I could sleep with her.|I mean...
{22479}{22512}How can I do that?
{22518}{22622}I've got a pop-up book that told me|everything I need to know.
{22628}{22679}I've never slept|with someone for a part.
{22685}{22749}Well, is she...
{22769}{22821}Sorry.
{22827}{22868}Is she good-looking?
{22874}{22952}She's totally good-looking.|If I met her in a bar...
{22958}{23049}...I'd be buying her breakfast.
{23058}{23139}After having slept with her.
{23237}{23289}Maybe this isn't such a big deal.
{23295}{23425}The way that I see it is, you get a|great job, and you get to have sex!
{23431}{23541}Throw in a tree and a fat guy,|and you've got Christmas!
{23608}{23687}I just don't think that|I want it that way, though.
{23693}{23752}I mean, let's say|I do make it, all right?
{23758}{23858}I'll always look back and wonder|if it was because of my talent or...
{23864}{23944}...you know, the little general.
{23973}{24043}Didn't you used to call it|"the little major"?
{24049}{24145}After Denise DeMarco,|I had to promote it.
{24251}{24287}Something from the bar?
{24293}{24353}Yes, I would like something.
{24359}{24408}No. No, thank you.
{24414}{24503}If you wanna drink, it's okay with me.|I've gotta get used to it.
{24509}{24577}No, no, really.|I wouldn't feel right about it.
{24583}{24627}Just some water, please.
{24633}{24756}- So my refrigerator light's out.|- Scotch on the rocks with a twist!
{24791}{24847}We're having some fun now, huh, Ross?
{24853}{24946}Wanna do another one?|Huh, Russ?
{24981}{25018}Eleven letters...
{25024}{25112}...atomic element number 101,|ends in "ium".
{25118}{25151}Dysprosium.
{25157}{25190}Dysprosium.
{25196}{25233}Try mendelevium.
{25239}{25303}And weenie number two has it.
{25309}{25437}Unless "Knights in White Satin"|was sung by the Doody Blues.
{25495}{25554}You don't see it?|You actually don't see it?
{25560}{25588}What?
{25594}{25637}Honey, you're dating Ross.
{25643}{25683}No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.
{25689}{25747}Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.
{25753}{25803}Steve, sleeve.
{25809}{25865}No one is named sleeve.
{25871}{25916}What are you talking about?
{25922}{26019}Other than their names being similar,|I do not see what you're seeing.
{26025}{26064}For your information...
{26070}{26124}...it's a card sharp,|not a card shark.
{26130}{26168}You could not be more wrong.
{26174}{26250}You could try,|but you would not be successful.
{26256}{26394}I'm gonna get some more coffee before|the pinching and eye-poking begins.
{26403}{26432}I know your problem.
{26438}{26479}Oh, you do, do you?
{26485}{26542}You're jealous.
{26572}{26608}Of what?
{26614}{26709}You're jealous|because I'm a real doctor.
{26721}{26763}Hey, you're a doctor of gums.
{26769}{26866}That's the smallest body part|you can major in.
{26873}{26932}Day one, floss.|Day two, here's your diploma.
{26938}{26964}You listen here...
{26970}{27013}- Let me finish.|- No, let me finish.
{27019}{27103}No, you let me fin...
{27394}{27455}Did Joey say what he was gonna do?
{27461}{27496}I don't even think he knew.
{27502}{27567}Would you sleep with somebody|to get a great job?
{27573}{27628}Who would I have to sleep with?
{27634}{27696}Me.
{27724}{27762}Why with you?
{27768}{27859}It's my game.|You want the job or not?
{27909}{27933}Good morning.
{27939}{27964}Where you going?
{27970}{28068}Bobby and I are going away|for the weekend. Remember?
{28074}{28113}What's with all the liquor?
{28119}{28177}What's going on?|Is Bobby drinking again?
{28183}{28270}This is not for him.|This is for me.
{28276}{28401}That way, he's sober but his|shoelace stories are more amusing.
{28493}{28592}God! Even his knock is boring!
{28619}{28695}- I'll be ready in a second.|- Could I talk to you?
{28701}{28758}Sure.
{28768}{28807}This is hard for me to say.
{28813}{28854}You fell off the wagon!
{28860}{28896}Oh, no, no.
{28902}{28931}It's about you.
{28937}{28972}What about me?
{28978}{29068}I think you may have|a drinking problem.
{29112}{29157}What, these?
{29163}{29251}No, these are for cuts and scrapes.
{29257}{29383}Look, I'm not strong enough to be|in a codependent relationship.
{29389}{29459}Oh, shoot.
{29489}{29594}Well, anyway,|I hope we can be friends.
{29667}{29687}Take care.
{29693}{29789}- You too.|- Goodbye.
{29834}{29898}What happened?
{29912}{29977}We kind of broke up.
{30113}{30148}Does anybody want these?
{30154}{30201}I'll take one.
{30207}{30328}Sometimes I hold stuff like this|and pretend I'm a giant.
{30425}{30464}How'd the callback go?
{30470}{30559}It was unbelievable. I walked|in there and she was all over me.
{30565}{30614}- What did you do?|- I couldn't do it.
{30620}{30664}I didn't want the part that way.
{30670}{30689}Good for you!
{30695}{30732}But wait!|I left her office...
{30738}{30840}...and she caught up with me|and offered me a bigger part.
{30846}{30906}So, and?
{30909}{31016}So, you are now looking at|Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...
{31022}{31108}...recurring in|at least four episodes!
{31114}{31194}All right, I gotta go shower.
{31569}{31627}I guess you guys heard|Rachel dumped me.
{31633}{31677}Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
{31683}{31738}She said I remind her|too much of somebody.
{31744}{31824}Any idea who|she's talking about?
{31833}{31935}Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.
{31945}{32019}She hates him.
{32021}{32048}Hey, Julie!
{32054}{32091}How are you doing?
{32097}{32172}I don't know. It's weird|not being with Ross...
{32178}{32228}...but I guess I'm doing okay.
{32234}{32339}Actually, I've got some|of his stuff that he...
{1}{45}Ripped with SubRip 1.17 and Verified by CdinT|cdint@hotmail.com
{46}{54}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{55}{128}Okay, here's his diaper bag...
{134}{204}...and his Mr. Winky.
{210}{271}And...
{272}{321}...him. Hi!
{327}{377}- How did everything go?|- Great!
{383}{441}There was a projectile...
{447}{529}...throwing up incident,|but he started it.
{535}{602}We've gotta go.
{604}{643}Oh, right.
{649}{705}I've got some news.|It's about us.
{711}{730}You and me?
{736}{784}No. Susan and me.
{790}{868}The other "us".
{937}{1012}We're getting married.
{1111}{1215}As in, "I now pronounce you|wife and wife" married?
{1221}{1306}We'd like you to come.|We understand if you don't want to.
{1312}{1434}Why wouldn't I want to come?|I had fun at the first wedding.
{1440}{1470}I just thought that...
{1476}{1583}Why shouldn't I be happy for you?|What would it say about me...
{1589}{1661}...if I couldn't revel|in your joy?
{1667}{1732}And I'm reveling, baby!|Believe me!
{1738}{1828}Is your finger caught in that chair?
{1844}{1917}Want us to go?
{1943}{2017}The One With the Lesbian Wedding
{2023}{2085}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{3121}{3186}This is cool.|You're actually on television.
{3192}{3245}I know.|It really hit me last night.
{3251}{3335}I'm on "Days of our Lives".
{3342}{3493}Then I started thinking about us,|and how these are the days of our lives.
{3519}{3539}Yes!
{3545}{3565}What?
{3571}{3643}Carol and Susan's caterer|had a bike accident...
{3649}{3737}...and she's in a|full-body cast.
{3791}{3861}They asked me, which is cool|since I've never catered...
{3867}{3925}...and I need the money.|Is this a problem?
{3931}{3980}- Would it matter?|- You're so great!
{3986}{4015}Thank you!
{4021}{4081}- You're really not going?|- I'm really not.
{4087}{4178}They already live together.|Why do they need to get married?
{4184}{4219}They love each other.
{4225}{4321}They wanna celebrate that love|with the people close to them.
{4327}{4401}If you wanna call|that a reason.
{4407}{4499}{y:i}Who's the bitterest|{y:i}man in the living room?
{4505}{4598}{y:i}The bitterest man|{y:i}in the living room?
{4598}{4659}Hi, neighbor.
{4682}{4780}- I thought you were over this.|- That has nothing to do with it.
{4786}{4872}If she were marrying a guy,|you wouldn't expect me to go.
{4878}{5006}If she were marrying a guy,|she'd be the worst lesbian ever.
{5041}{5073}Did I miss it?
{5079}{5173}No, I'm on right after this guy|shoots himself.
{5179}{5224}She's pretty.
{5230}{5263}And she's really nice.
{5269}{5338}She taught me about|how to work with the cameras...
{5344}{5426}...and smell-the-fart acting.
{5461}{5519}- I'm sorry, what?|- Excuse me?
{5525}{5601}You got so many lines|to learn so fast that sometimes...
{5607}{5675}...you need a minute|to remember your next one.
{5681}{5721}So while you're thinking...
{5727}{5809}...you take this big pause|where you look all intense.
{5815}{5877}Like this...
{6009}{6092}Here's my scene!|Here's my scene!
{6123}{6163}{y:i}Mrs. Wallace?
{6169}{6225}{y:i}Dr. Drake Ramoray,|{y:i}your sister's neurosurgeon.
{6231}{6281}{y:i}Is she going to be all right?
{6287}{6379}{y:i}I'm afraid the situation|{y:i}is much more dire than we'd expected.
{6385}{6477}{y:i}Your sister's suffering from a...
{6581}{6667}{y:i}... subcranial hematoma.
{6675}{6805}{y:i}Perhaps we can|{y:i}discuss this further over coffee.
{6916}{6978}Nice!
{6979}{7102}For a minute, I thought you were|actually smelling something.
{7132}{7165}- Do it again!|- All right!
{7171}{7241}- That was so good!|- Do it again.
{7247}{7352}"Damn it, Braverman!|It's right there on the chart!"
{7354}{7448}I gotta get to work.|I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
{7454}{7478}No, that's me.
{7484}{7552}Oh, right.
{7622}{7700}Oh, thanks. Couldn't...
{7735}{7761}Is everything okay?
{7767}{7831}No.
{7866}{7946}One of my clients died|on the massage table today.
{7952}{7991}Oh, my God!
{7997}{8107}That's a little more relaxed|than you want them to get.
{8130}{8198}She was, you know,|82 years old...
{8204}{8279}...and her name was|Mrs. Adelman.
{8285}{8304}Oh, honey.
{8310}{8371}It's just so strange. You know...
{8377}{8441}...she probably woke up|this morning and thought...
{8447}{8536}...I'll have some breakfast,|take a walk, then have my massage.
{8542}{8655}Little did she know God thought,|"Okay, but that's it."
{8707}{8773}Oh, but the weirdest things was...
{8779}{8855}...I was cleansing her aura|when it happened.
{8861}{8925}And when her spirit|left her body...
{8931}{9004}...I don't think it went very far.
{9010}{9051}What do you mean?
{9057}{9150}I think it went into me.
{9325}{9353}This is so hard.
{9359}{9408}I can't decide|between lamb or duck.
{9414}{9453}Well, lambs are scarier.
{9459}{9577}Or the movie would've been called|{y:i}Silence of the Ducks.
{9579}{9616}Okay, who ordered what?
{9622}{9733}I had the half-drunk cappuccino|with the lipstick on the rim.
{9739}{9817}And this with the cigarette|butt in it, is that decaf?
{9823}{9861}Oh, God.
{9867}{9917}You're so uptight|about your mom coming.
{9923}{10001}I know. I just don't want|her to think that because...
{10007}{10067}...I didn't marry Barry|my life is crap.
{10073}{10140}Talk about crap, just|listen to Stella Neidman...
{10146}{10262}...tell her story about Rod Steiger|for the hundredth time.
{10329}{10426}Pheebs? How long do you think|this lady will be with us?
{10432}{10514}I don't know. She obviously|has some unfinished business.
{10520}{10582}Sit up!
{10626}{10653}There she is!
{10659}{10739}- Mom!|- Hey, sweetie!
{10851}{10913}So this is where you work!
{10919}{10971}Oh, it's wonderful!
{10977}{11079}Is it a living room?|Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?
{11085}{11125}I guess that's the fun.
{11131}{11179}Pretty much.|Here, meet my friends.
{11185}{11253}Monica! You look gorgeous!
{11259}{11376}Oh, my! The last time I saw you,|it was eat or be eaten.
{11382}{11419}This is Joey.
{11425}{11451}This is Phoebe.
{11457}{11486}This is Chandler.
{11492}{11517}You remember Ross?
{11523}{11550}Oh, hello, Ross.
{11556}{11613}Mrs. Greene.
{11637}{11711}What do you think of my|daughter, in the apron...
{11717}{11748}...with the big job!
{11754}{11811}Oh, Mom!
{11817}{11935}If you didn't pour the coffee,|no one would have anything to drink.
{11941}{12037}Believe me, sometimes that happens.
{12050}{12131}This is just so exciting!|You know, I never worked.
{12137}{12214}I went from my father's house|to the sorority house...
{12220}{12308}...to my husband's house.|I am just so proud of you!
{12314}{12359}Really?
{12365}{12420}I know who you remind me of.
{12426}{12451}Evelyn Durmer.
{12457}{12612}That's before the lousy face-lift.|Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
{12660}{12745}Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer?
{12751}{12847}I don't know.|Who's Soupy Sales?
{12877}{12906}Oh, my God!
{12912}{13019}There's an unattractive|nude man playing the cello.
{13025}{13135}Just be glad he's not playing|a smaller instrument.
{13199}{13249}You have some life here, sweetie!
{13255}{13338}Mom, I realize you were upset|when I didn't marry Barry...
{13344}{13429}...and get the house in the suburbs|with all the security.
{13435}{13485}This is just|so much better for me.
{13491}{13584}I know.|You didn't love Barry, honey.
{13590}{13650}And I've never seen you this happy.
{13656}{13778}I look at you and I think,|"This is what I want."
{13792}{13849}For me.
{13855}{13913}Well, not just for you.
{13919}{13966}What do you mean?
{13972}{14107}I'm considering|leaving your father.
{14140}{14196}All right, tell me|if this is too cute.
{14202}{14307}Lesbian wedding...|chicken breasts.
{14367}{14441}Oh, God.|I think I'm gonna be sick.
{14447}{14567}What? It's not like I'm putting|little nipples on them.
{14622}{14684}- You had no idea?|- None.
{14690}{14723}They didn't fight?
{14729}{14793}No, they didn't even|talk to each other.
{14799}{14897}How was I suppose to know|they were having problems?
{14903}{15007}You know, in my day,|divorce was not an option.
{15013}{15081}Hey, look who's up!
{15112}{15174}I just can't believe|this is happening!
{15180}{15244}When I was little,|all parents got divorced.
{15250}{15324}I figured as an adult,|I wouldn't have to worry about it.
{15330}{15399}Can't you look at this|as flattering?
{15405}{15453}She just wants to be like you.
{15459}{15561}Well, couldn't she have just|copied my haircut?
{15567}{15635}When my parents divorced,|they sent me to a shrink...
{15641}{15714}...and she told me|that kids blame themselves.
{15720}{15803}But in your case,|it's actually kind of true.
{15809}{15853}Oh, that's him.
{15859}{15959}Damn! My mail-order|grandfather hasn't come yet.
{15965}{16006}- Phoebe?|- Hi, Mr. Adelman.
{16012}{16057}- Nice to see you.|- Thanks for coming.
{16063}{16187}That's okay. Although you did|cut into my busy day of sitting.
{16209}{16240}Do you wanna sit?
{16246}{16352}No, I spent most of my morning|trying to stand up.
{16377}{16420}What can I do|for you, my dear?
{16426}{16500}Okay, I don't know how|to say this, but...
{16506}{16571}I think when your wife's spirit|left her body...
{16577}{16636}...it kind of stuck around...
{16642}{16678}...in me.
{16684}{16735}You're saying|my wife is in you?
{16741}{16814}Yeah. You don't have to|believe me, but...
{16820}{16898}...can you think of|any unfinished business she had?
{16904}{16951}Any reason to hang around?
{16957}{16996}I don't know what to say.
{17002}{17055}All I can think of is that...
{17061}{17166}...she used to say that before she died,|she wanted to see everything.
{17172}{17228}- Everything?|- Everything.
{17234}{17270}That's a lot of stuff.
{17276}{17302}Oh, wait, I...
{17308}{17440}I remember she also said she wanted|to sleep with me one last time.
{17622}{17732}I'm sorry.|There's laughing in my head.
{17755}{17827}Worth a shot, huh?
{17929}{17973}Look at this!
{17979}{18049}These are all Halloween,|three years ago.
{18055}{18101}Oh, and look, here's Barry.
{18107}{18155}He came straight|from the office?
{18161}{18249}Oh, no.|That was his costume.
{18255}{18381}See, he's actually an orthodontist,|but he came as a regular dentist.
{18387}{18413}You guys?
{18419}{18492}Remember when I said|that I don't need your help?
{18498}{18533}Actually, I think you said...
{18539}{18613}..."Don't touch that|and get out of my kitchen."
{18619}{18698}Really? Weird.|Anyway...
{18704}{18774}I planned really well.|I planned and planned.
{18780}{18846}I just didn't plan|enough time to do it.
{18852}{18951}- You want some help?|- Lf you want.
{19032}{19061}What a day!
{19067}{19144}I took her everywhere.
{19179}{19250}The Museum of Modern Art,|Rockefeller Center...
{19256}{19291}...the Statue of Liberty.
{19297}{19327}She's still with you?
{19333}{19443}Yes. I guess she hasn't|seen everything yet.
{19449}{19557}Be right back. She has to go|to the bathroom again.
{19574}{19667}Such a pretty face!
{19716}{19799}Oh, this is so much fun!|Just the girls!
{19805}{19896}Do you know what we should do?|Does anybody have any marijuana?
{19902}{19959}God!
{20000}{20075}Look, no one's smoking pot|around all this food.
{20081}{20125}Well, that's fine.
{20131}{20237}I never did it.|I just thought I might.
{20249}{20316}What's new in sex?
{20347}{20391}What's new in sex?
{20397}{20456}The only man I've been with|is your father.
{20462}{20538}I'm dicing. I'm dicing.|I don't hear anything.
{20544}{20624}This is no offense to your dad,|but I was thinking...
{20630}{20660}...there might be more.
{20666}{20745}You know what? I cannot|have this conversation with you.
{20751}{20773}All right.
{20779}{20876}You come here and drop this bomb on me|before you even tell Daddy.
{20882}{20967}Do you want my blessing?|Want me to talk you out of it?
{20973}{21006}Then what do you want?
{21012}{21067}I guess I figured|you would understand.
{21073}{21159}Why on earth|would I understand this?
{21165}{21225}You didn't marry your Barry, honey.
{21231}{21314}But I married mine.
{21436}{21526}We're in trouble. We've only got|12 hours and 36 minutes left.
{21532}{21579}Move, move, move!
{21585}{21691}I feel like you should|have German subtitles.
{21709}{21741}Joey, speed it up!
{21747}{21866}I'm sorry! It's the pigs!|They're reluctant to get in the blanket!
{21872}{21958}How did this happen?|I thought you had this planned out.
{21964}{22026}Do you want me to cry?
{22032}{22077}Is that what you want?
{22083}{22140}Do you wanna see me cry?
{22146}{22204}Sir, no, sir!
{22257}{22281}All right, you!
{22287}{22375}No. Look, I told you,|I am not a part of this thing.
{22381}{22485}Look, Ross. I know you have issues with|Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.
{22491}{22564}But if you don't help,|I'm gonna take those hot dogs...
{22570}{22662}...and create an appetizer|called "Pigs In Ross".
{22668}{22701}All right, ball a melon!
{22707}{22819}How come I'm stuck dicing|when he gets to ball a melon?
{22911}{22976}- How's it going?|- Great! Right on schedule.
{22982}{23072}Got my little happy helpers.
{23076}{23132}That's fine. Whatever.
{23138}{23161}What's wrong?
{23167}{23225}Nothing.
{23226}{23334}Okay, everything.|I think we're calling off the wedding.
{23340}{23432}You're still gonna pay me, right?
{23440}{23502}Or something a little less selfish.
{23508}{23554}What's the matter?|What happened?
{23560}{23639}My parents called to say|they weren't coming.
{23645}{23725}I knew they were|having trouble with this, but...
{23731}{23834}...they're my parents.|They're supposed to give me away.
{23840}{23931}Susan and I fought because|I said maybe we should call it off.
{23937}{24007}She said, "This isn't for them.|It's for us."
{24013}{24094}And if I couldn't see that,|we should cancel the wedding.
{24100}{24184}I don't know what to do.
{24197}{24306}I can't believe I'm gonna say this,|but I think Susan's right.
{24312}{24349}You do?
{24355}{24489}Do you love her? And don't be|too emphatic about this.
{24507}{24530}Of course I do.
{24536}{24573}Well then, that's it.
{24579}{24715}If George and Adelaide can't|accept that, then the hell with them.
{24716}{24781}If my parents didn't want me|to marry you...
{24787}{24871}...no way that would've|stopped me.
{24876}{24931}Look, this is your wedding.
{24937}{24999}Do it.
{25036}{25093}You're right.|Of course you're right.
{25099}{25136}So we're back on?
{25142}{25170}We're back on.
{25176}{25282}You heard the woman!|Peel! Chop! Devil!
{25295}{25387}Can't believe|I lost two minutes!
{25607}{25646}It just seems so futile.
{25652}{25777}You know?|All these women, and nothing!
{25802}{25898}I feel like Superman|without my powers, you know?
{25904}{26027}I have the cape,|and yet I cannot fly.
{26044}{26155}Well, now you understand|how I feel every single day.
{26161}{26269}The world is my lesbian wedding.
{26501}{26558}Butterscotch?
{26564}{26595}No one?
{26601}{26702}All right,|you'll be sorry later.
{27501}{27577}- Thank you.|- Anytime.
{27632}{27689}Ross.
{27770}{27815}Nothing makes God happier...
{27821}{27924}...than when two people, any two people,|come together in love.
{27930}{27998}Friends, family,|we're gathered here today...
{28004}{28066}...to join Carol and Susan|in holy matrimony.
{28072}{28106}Oh, my God!
{28112}{28202}Now I've seen everything!
{28247}{28280}She's gone!
{28286}{28310}She's gone!
{28316}{28338}She's gone.
{28344}{28442}Go ahead, get married.|Go, go!

{28631}{28664}Would you look at them?
{28670}{28764}Yeah. Can't help but.
{28861}{28949}How's that pig-in-the-blanket|working out for you?
{28955}{29042}I wrapped those bad boys.
{29047}{29073}I miss Rose.
{29079}{29099}Oh, yeah?
{29105}{29221}I know it's kind of weird, but|she was a big part of my life...
{29227}{29281}I don't know, I feel alone.
{29287}{29419}You know, I couldn't help|overhearing what you just said.
{29425}{29531}I think it's time you forget about Rose,|move on with your life.
{29537}{29575}How about we get you a drink?
{29581}{29660}Okay. So nice!
{29819}{29927}I shouldn't even bother|coming up with a line, right?
{29962}{30001}Hey, Mom, having fun?
{30007}{30135}Am I! I just danced|with a wonderfully large woman.
{30141}{30223}And three other girls|made eyes at me over at the buffet.
{30229}{30291}I'm not saying|it's something I wanna pursue...
{30297}{30387}...but it's nice to know|I have options.
{30427}{30507}There's more alcohol, right?
{30587}{30657}How you doing?
{30710}{30797}You did a good thing today.
{30878}{30911}You wanna dance?
{30917}{30973}No, that's fine.
{30979}{31014}Come on.
{31020}{31102}I'll let you lead.
{31511}{31551}Look, penis, schmenis!
{31557}{31637}Okay? We're all people.
{31856}{31949}Which one of us is gonna be|the first one to get married?
{31955}{31993}Mon, I was married.
{31999}{32067}- Yeah, me too, technically.|- I had a wedding.
{32073}{32144}Just trying to|start a discussion.
{32150}{32274}Which one do you think|will be the last to get married?
{32346}{32377}Isn't Ben in this?
{32383}{32402}Of course!
{32408}{32465}Absolutely.

{225}{308}{y:i}Can't get the monkey off your back?
{314}{366}{y:i}Then put it in your mouth...
{372}{415}{y:i}... with Monkeyshine Beer!
{421}{501}{y:i}Get it, monkey
{507}{590}{y:i}Get it, get it, monkey

{681}{744}{y:i}Because it's a jungle out there!
{750}{801}That commercial always|makes me so sad.
{807}{884}But then the guy opens his beer|and girls run at him...
{890}{944}...so everything works out okay.
{950}{1019}I meant because the monkey|reminds me of Marcel.
{1025}{1050}I can see that.
{1056}{1169}Because they both have those big|brown eyes and the little pouty chin.
{1175}{1252}And the fact that|they're both monkeys?
{1258}{1321}I wonder if I did the right thing,|giving him away.
{1327}{1428}Ross, you had to. He was|humping everything in sight.
{1434}{1563}My Malibu Barbie will no longer|be wearing white to her wedding.
{1589}{1642}Remember when he'd borrow your hat...
{1648}{1750}...and when you got it back,|there'd be monkey raisins in it?
{1756}{1873}When he did it, it was funny.|When I did it to my boss's hat...

{3599}{3626}Oh, wait.
{3632}{3767}"P.S. Enclosed, please find|14 of my eyelashes."
{3773}{3885}In Crazy World, that means|you're married.
{3912}{4014}It's not addressed to "Days Of Our Lives".|This came to your apartment.
{4020}{4055}She was in our building.
{4061}{4108}Oh, my God.
{4114}{4196}I got my very own stalker!
{4277}{4313}Where are you off to?
{4319}{4384}There's a paleontology|conference in L.A.
{4390}{4485}So I figured I'd go and drive down|to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
{4491}{4607}He will be surprised.|Till he realizes he's a monkey...
{4612}{4712}...and isn't capable of that emotion.
{4728}{4816}Phoebe? That really cute guy|is here again.
{4822}{4853}Okay, so everyone...
{4859}{4938}...pretend I'm telling you a story|and it's really funny.
{4944}{5031}So everyone just laugh. Now!
{5040}{5112}I know, I know!
{5161}{5189}I'm Rob Donan.
{5195}{5220}Hi, Rob Donan.
{5226}{5362}I don't know anything about music,|but I think you're really great.
{5394}{5488}Anyway, I schedule performers|for children's libraries.
{5494}{5605}And I was thinking, have you thought|about playing your songs for kids?
{5611}{5707}I would love to have kids...
{5755}{5872}...hear me play the songs|that I will write for them.
{5889}{5925}What do we do for dinner?
{5931}{6016}We could cook for ourselves.
{6150}{6180}{y:i}It's Erika.
{6186}{6217}My God. The stalker!
{6223}{6288}{y:i}Never mind. It's open.
{6316}{6373}Hitting her with a frying pan|is a good idea.
{6379}{6493}But we want a backup plan,|just in case she isn't a cartoon!
{6499}{6576}Let's get out of here!
{6615}{6702}The one time they're not home!
{6706}{6751}We'll leave.|When we pass her...
{6757}{6852}...she won't know me,|because we never met!
{6859}{6947}That's how radio stars|escape stalkers!
{6959}{7032}She's coming!
{7137}{7183}It's me.
{7189}{7280}This is it.|This is how we're gonna die.
{7286}{7309}You ready?
{7315}{7387}Wait, wait, wait!
{7557}{7622}Erika!
{7829}{7866}- Mr. Geller?|- Yes, hi.
{7872}{7936}Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.
{7942}{7991}You had a question?
{7997}{8084}I can't find the monkey I donated|last year. He's a capuchin...
{8090}{8156}...answers to the name Marcel?
{8162}{8235}I'm afraid I have some bad news.
{8241}{8334}Marcel has passed on.
{8340}{8402}Oh, my God. What happened?
{8408}{8470}He got sick,|and then he got sicker...
{8476}{8531}...and then he got a little better.
{8537}{8613}But then he died.
{8636}{8670}I can't believe this!
{8676}{8790}I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.|But you know, there's an old saying:
{8796}{8894}"Sometimes monkeys die."
{8897}{8975}It's not a great saying...
{8981}{9035}...but it certainly is fitting today.
{9041}{9109}- Someone should've called me.|- I'm sorry.
{9115}{9183}Look, I know this can't|bring him back...
{9189}{9273}...but here, it's just a gesture.
{9282}{9311}Zoo dollars?
{9317}{9455}Yes, and come see the bird show|at 4. The macaws wear hats.
{9457}{9568}It's a lot cuter|if your monkey hasn't just died.
{9707}{9777}I know.
{9777}{9843}I can't believe Joey's having|lunch with his stalker!
{9849}{9884}What is she like?
{9890}{9947}You remember Kathy Bates in "Misery"?
{9953}{10046}Well, she looks|the exact opposite of that.
{10052}{10098}And she's not crazy?
{10104}{10161}Oh, no, no.|She's a total whack-job.
{10167}{10266}She thinks that Joey is|actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.
{10272}{10313}Oh, my God!
{10319}{10357}And he's going out with her?
{10363}{10404}He cannot pursue this.
{10410}{10493}Just because this woman sees Joey|through the magical bo x...
{10499}{10560}...in her living room|doesn't mean she's not a person.
{10566}{10671}Does she not deserve happiness?|Does she not deserve love?
{10677}{10798}Why are you looking at me? He's|the one who wants to boff the maniac!
{10804}{10831}Are you okay?
{10837}{10884}No. I'm just nervous.
{10890}{10968}Maybe if I just picture them all|in their underwear...
{10974}{11110}That's not a good idea. That's|the reason the last guy got fired.
{11165}{11225}I'm used to playing for grownups.
{11231}{11310}Grownups drink their coffee|and do their grownup thing.
{11316}{11344}And kids...
{11350}{11400}...listen.
{11406}{11471}It's just a huge responsibility.
{11477}{11508}What?
{11514}{11580}Are you gonna kiss me?
{11586}{11670}I was thinking about it.
{11734}{11835}Alrighty! Let's play some tunes!
{11869}{11999}- Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.|- Hi, Phoebe!
{12035}{12162}I'm gonna play some songs|about grandparents, okay?

{12422}{12523}{y:i}And last time you saw her|{y:i}She looked so much thinner
{12529}{12607}{y:i}Now your mom and your dad said|{y:i}She moved to Peru
{12613}{12732}{y:i}But the truth is she died|{y:i}And someday you will too
{12960}{13073}- Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?|- Yeah, it is.
{13079}{13124}What?
{13130}{13194}Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...
{13200}{13303}...and a while ago you were|reattaching Simone's spinal cord.
{13309}{13374}That was a tricky one.
{13383}{13408}In reality...
{13414}{13528}...that operation takes 10 hours.|But they only showed it for 2 minutes.
{13534}{13591}Who's "they"?
{13617}{13682}No one.
{13688}{13789}Drake, you are so talented.|Let me see those hands.
{13795}{13871}Oh, these hands,|these beautiful hands.
{13877}{13924}I could just eat them.
{13930}{13984}But I won't.
{13990}{14071}Otherwise my watch would fall off.
{14180}{14242}No, seriously.
{14249}{14269}These hands...
{14275}{14339}...these miracle, magical,|life-giving hands.
{14345}{14464}Just to be near them, touch them,|maybe even lick one?
{14470}{14560}All right. Just one.
{14752}{14832}You're good at that.
{14839}{14886}Oh, my God! Someone!|He's choking!
{14892}{14967}Is anyone here a doctor?
{14973}{15021}Yes, the best doctor in Salem!
{15027}{15107}Dr. Drake Ramoray!
{15440}{15577}Meet me in the nocturnal|house in 15 minutes.
{15607}{15734}Hey, look. I don't really enjoy|being with other men that way.
{15740}{15811}But, zoo dollars?
{15817}{15879}It's about your monkey!
{15885}{15963}It's alive.
{16037}{16121}I don't understand.|Why didn't you help that man?
{16127}{16188}Because I'm a neurosurgeon...
{16194}{16284}...and that was clearly a case of...
{16290}{16354}..."foodal chokage".
{16452}{16506}I gotta tell you something...
{16512}{16557}You don't have to tell me anything.
{16563}{16619}You don't have to|explain yourself to me.
{16625}{16697}Who am I to question|the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?
{16703}{16751}I should be happy to be near you.
{16757}{16819}Hey, I...
{16877}{16912}Hey what?
{16918}{16987}That's it. Just hey!
{16993}{17086}Like at the end of a dance. Hey!
{17233}{17276}{y:i}There'll be times when you get older
{17282}{17322}{y:i}When you'll want to sleep with people
{17328}{17435}{y:i}Just to make them like you|{y:i}But don't!
{17441}{17462}{y:i}'Cause...
{17468}{17512}{y:i}... that's another thing...
{17518}{17577}{y:i}... that you don't wanna do|Everybody!
{17583}{17735}{y:i}That's another thing|{y:i}That you don't wanna do
{17735}{17779}- Excellent!|- Very informative!
{17785}{17850}Not at all inappropriate!
{17856}{17979}Thank you for coming, everybody!|There are cookies in the back.
{17985}{18021}That was great.
{18027}{18077}The kids loved you.
{18083}{18143}Yea! I rock!
{18149}{18217}And you know why?|Because you told the truth.
{18223}{18276}Nobody ever tells kids the truth.
{18282}{18346}You were incredible!
{18352}{18383}But...?
{18389}{18465}- How'd you know there was a "but"?|- I sense these things.
{18471}{18563}It was either "but" or "butter".
{18571}{18626}The thing is, I think|some of the parents...
{18632}{18674}...they were hoping that...
{18680}{18746}...you'd play more songs|about barnyard animals.
{18752}{18783}I can do that.
{18789}{18811}Really?
{18817}{18905}Because that would be fantastic!
{18911}{18969}What? You wanna kiss me?
{18975}{19053}I'm thinking about it.
{19074}{19121}The bat.
{19127}{19180}Ambassador of darkness.
{19186}{19278}Flitting out of his cave|like a winged messenger.
{19284}{19391}Sightless specter of the macabre.
{19397}{19441}Buddy, my monkey?
{19447}{19515}Oh, yeah, right.
{19522}{19548}There was a break-in...
{19554}{19616}...a few months back.|Inside job.
{19622}{19656}Your monkey was taken.
{19662}{19726}The zoo told me|that my monkey was dead!
{19732}{19770}The zoo!
{19776}{19872}You believe everything|the zoo tells you?
{19897}{19979}That's the only thing|the zoo's ever told me.
{19985}{20065}Of course they'll say that!|They don't want the bad publicity.
{20071}{20113}It's all a great big cover-up.
{20119}{20204}Do you have any idea|how high up this thing goes?
{20210}{20255}That guy Lipson?
{20261}{20333}Lipson knows?
{20339}{20398}Lipson knows, huh?
{20404}{20443}Hello, Mr. Possum.
{20449}{20538}Enigma of the trees,|upside-down denizen of the night.
{20544}{20651}- Taunting gravity...|- Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?
{20661}{20705}Word on the street...
{20711}{20808}When I say "street", I mean those|pretend streets here at the zoo.
{20814}{20882}Of course.
{20896}{20955}Your monkey found a new career...
{20961}{21063}...in the entertainment field.|That's all I know.
{21069}{21109}This is unbelievable!
{21115}{21245}So what is this information|worth to you, my friend?
{21251}{21314}Are you trying|to get me to bribe you?
{21320}{21386}Maybe.
{21390}{21487}But you already told me everything.
{21633}{21658}{y:i}Check it out.
{21664}{21744}He actually is|the Monkeyshine monkey!
{21750}{21778}What'll you do?
{21784}{21860}I'm gonna call the beer company|and try to find him.
{21866}{21956}That's what I did|when I lost my Clydesdales.
{21962}{21997}Okay, hi again!
{22003}{22084}Hi, Phoebe!
{22090}{22223}Today, we're gonna start with|some songs about barnyard animals.
{22229}{22277}{y:i}Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"
{22283}{22330}{y:i}Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"
{22336}{22391}{y:i}Then the farmer hits him|{y:i}And grinds him up
{22397}{22485}{y:i}And that's how we get hamburgers
{22520}{22625}{y:i}Now chickens!
{22631}{22680}{y:i}Only you who can save her, Drake!
{22686}{22748}{y:i}Damn it! I'm a doctor.|{y:i}I'm not God!
{22754}{22840}There goes my whole belief system.
{22860}{22891}It's Erika.
{22897}{22931}Quick! Shut off the TV.
{22937}{22979}I wanna see what happens!
{22985}{23040}I get Leslie out of the coma|then we make out.
{23046}{23101}How can that be?|You were kissing Sabrina!
{23107}{23237}Rachel, it's a world|where Joey is a neurosurgeon.
{23282}{23315}Hey, Erika. Come in.
{23321}{23400}How did you get here so fast?|I just saw you in Salem.
{23406}{23483}Right, they choppered me in.
{23489}{23516}What's up?
{23522}{23571}You're having a little party too!
{23577}{23631}- Is she here?|- Who?
{23637}{23689}Sabrina. I know about you two!
{23695}{23804}I saw you today, kissing|in the doctor's lounge.
{23809}{23843}It's not what you think...
{23849}{23947}You told me I was the only one!
{24001}{24041}All right, look.|That's it.
{24047}{24095}We shouldn't see each other anymore.
{24101}{24155}I should have told you|a long time ago...
{24161}{24208}...but I am not Drake Ramoray.
{24214}{24307}I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor.|I just pretend to be a doctor.
{24313}{24426}Oh, my God! Do the people|at the hospital know?
{24482}{24529}Somebody wanna help me out here?
{24535}{24594}Oh, I know! I know!
{24600}{24631}{y:i}Where am I?
{24637}{24673}{y:i}University Hospital...
{24679}{24769}{y:i}... where you've been|{y:i}for the last 18 years.
{24775}{24828}How can you be here and there?
{24834}{24886}Because it's a TV show!
{24892}{24968}What are you getting at?
{24987}{25023}I'm not Drake!
{25029}{25111}That's right!|He's not Drake. He's...
{25117}{25206}...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!
{25301}{25353}Is this true?
{25359}{25407}Yes! Yes, it is true!
{25413}{25455}And I know this...
{25461}{25578}...because he pretended|to be Drake to sleep with me!
{25695}{25761}And then he told me|he would run away with me!
{25767}{25834}And he didn't!
{25847}{25964}And you left the toilet seat up,|you bastard!
{26052}{26118}Is all this true?
{26206}{26253}Yes, I'm afraid it is.
{26259}{26309}You deserve much better than me.
{26315}{26424}You deserve to be with the real Drake.|He's the one you fell in love with.
{26430}{26480}Go to Salem. Find him!
{26486}{26533}He's the guy for you!
{26539}{26614}Oh, Hans!
{26647}{26671}Hans?
{26677}{26738}Hans!
{26739}{26798}Yo, evil twin!

{26894}{26962}Good luck in Salem.
{26968}{27010}Take care.
{27016}{27093}I'll never forget you, Hans.
{27176}{27237}All right.|The people who threw the water!
{27243}{27266}Helping you out!
{27272}{27309}Fired?
{27315}{27346}Why?
{27352}{27431}The library board got a lot|of complaints from parents...
{27437}{27473}...about the stuff in your songs.
{27479}{27519}I can't believe it!
{27525}{27662}Did you tell your board that|the kids want to hear the truth?
{27726}{27750}I see.
{27756}{27868}Maybe if you just played|some regular kiddy songs?
{27874}{27931}What do you want me to be?|Like some...
{27937}{28045}...stupid, big,|like, purple dinosaur?
{28051}{28086}You don't have to be Barney.
{28092}{28169}Who's Barney?
{28256}{28341}I tracked down Marcel and get this.|He's healthy, he's happy...
{28347}{28441}...and he's in New York filming|{y:i}Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.
{28447}{28481}You're kidding!
{28487}{28528}- This is amazing!|- I know.
{28534}{28651}I finally get a part on TV,|and the monkey's making movies.
{28663}{28727}Rachel, I'm ready.
{28804}{28925}Excuse me. Is this where the|singing lady is, who tells the truth?
{28931}{28998}I guess that's me.
{29003}{29088}She's here!

{29440}{29546}{y:i}Though some just say|{y:i}They're kidding themselves
{29755}{29816}This is exciting! I haven't|seen my monkey in a year.
{29822}{29900}What, you never|look down in the shower?
{29906}{30007}I'm not allowed to make one joke|in the "monkey is penis" genre?
{30013}{30044}Back up, please.
{30050}{30082}Back up. Come on.
{30088}{30149}Excuse me.|Where can we find the monkey?
{30155}{30189}I'm sorry.|It's a closed set.
{30195}{30271}I'm sorry, you don't understand.|I'm a friend of his.
{30277}{30326}We used to live together.
{30332}{30444}And I have a timeshare|in the Poconos with Flipper.

{717}{799}Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!
{847}{921}Whoa, dude. Burn!
{927}{959}I don't get it.
{965}{1015}He seemed so happy|to see me yesterday.
{1021}{1161}Don't take it personal. He's under|pressure, starring in a movie and all.
{1165}{1212}How big of a star is Marcel?
{1218}{1293}In human terms? I'd say...
{1299}{1374}...Cybill Shepherd.
{1414}{1535}So you guys in the movie|or you just really paranoid?
{1541}{1565}Hey, Sal?

{5099}{5137}Remember the class play?
{5143}{5285}You pulled up my skirt and the|entire auditorium saw my underpants?

{5617}{5659}It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

{6785}{6819}She thinks you're cute.
{6825}{6898}You don't think I'm cute?

{7243}{7392}You can tell her|I think her friend is cute.
{7544}{7646}- Makeup!|- That's me. I gotta go.
{7709}{7857}How many times must I touch you on|the arm before you ask me on a date?

{9007}{9087}If you want to go out|with him, you can.

{9152}{9263}Jean-Claude, she said yes!|I'll see you tonight!
{9290}{9363}Thank you.
{9466}{9529}Then Jean-Claude took me|to Crossroads...

{9614}{9666}Oh, man. She's so smokin'!
{9672}{9752}She's got the greatest set of...

{10328}{10382}I have to cancel racquetball tonight.
{10388}{10464}Marcel's trainer will let me|have him for a couple of hours.
{10470}{10512}You're blowing me off for a monkey?
{10518}{10582}We can reschedule for Saturday.
{10588}{10684}Unless you hook up|with a bunch of pigeons.
{10690}{10737}Stick a fork in me...
{10743}{10802}...I am done!
{10808}{10839}Stick a fork what?
{10845}{10893}Like when you're cooking a steak.
{10899}{10974}I don't eat meat.
{10983}{11028}How do you know vegetables are done?
{11034}{11107}Well, you don't.|You eat them and you can tell.
{11113}{11191}Okay, then eat me, I'm done!
{11249}{11286}I've met the perfect woman.
{11292}{11358}We're sitting on her couch,|fooling around...
{11364}{11423}...and then she turns to me and says:
{11429}{11507}"Did you ever want to do it|in an elevator?"
{11513}{11536}What did you say?
{11542}{11636}I believe my exact words were...
{11662}{11717}How do you know if you wanna do that?
{11723}{11784}You just know.
{11934}{12035}We gotta go.|Got a reservation in 30 minutes.
{12049}{12172}What I had planned shouldn't take|more than two, three minutes, tops.
{12178}{12283}Two hundred seconds of passion!|We gotta go.
{12287}{12328}But...
{12334}{12401}...here's an idea.
{12407}{12490}Have you ever worn women's underwear?
{12496}{12577}Well, yes, actually...
{12583}{12648}...but they were my Aunt Edna's.
{12654}{12726}And there were three of us in there.
{12732}{12806}I was thinking|it would be kind of sexy...
{12812}{12924}...if you wore mine tonight|at dinner.
{12999}{13064}You want me to wear your panties?
{13070}{13095}Could you?
{13101}{13165}If I was wearing your underwear...
{13171}{13252}...then what would you be wearing?
{13380}{13454}You're swell!
{13479}{13550}I made Marcel's favorite dish,|banana cake...
{13556}{13631}...with mealworm.
{13710}{13769}Candle.
{13775}{13880}What do you think's|gonna happen here tonight?
{13992}{14082}Hi, are you on your way over...
{14169}{14261}No, I understand.|A monkey's gotta work.
{14267}{14296}It's no big deal.
{14302}{14437}It's not like I had|anything special planned.
{14681}{14783}Rachel, why don't you|start talking first?
{14789}{14840}I feel that this is|totally unjustified.
{14846}{14957}She gave me the green light,|I did nothing...
{14975}{15077}Do you think I can't|see you in the TV set?
{15140}{15196}If there's something|you'd like to share...
{15202}{15240}You had no right to date him!
{15246}{15317}- That's the most ridiculous...|- You sold me out!
{15323}{15367}- I did not!|- You absolutely...
{15373}{15457}Would you let me talk!
{15491}{15568}Did you just flick me?
{15570}{15668}Well, you wouldn't let me|finish and I was...
{15674}{15726}That hurt!
{15732}{15760}Quit flicking!
{15766}{15800}Stop flicking!
{15806}{15871}You flicked me first!
{15992}{16062}Let's not do this!
{16109}{16168}Happy thoughts!
{16371}{16448}Now I'm gonna kick some ass!
{16628}{16735}All right. Now, I will|let go if you both stop.
{16741}{16820}You want me to stop seeing him?
{16826}{16906}You want me to just tell him|you're seeing him instead?
{16912}{16998}Is that what you want?
{17015}{17097}That's what you want?
{17122}{17176}- Fine!|- Fine!
{17182}{17238}There we go.
{17244}{17368}If we were in prison,|you guys would be, like, my bitches.
{17555}{17600}Thanks for letting me tag along.
{17606}{17660}Forget about it.
{17666}{17715}How you doing there, squirmy?
{17721}{17765}I'm hanging in.
{17771}{17837}And a little out.
{17878}{17945}So assistant to the director?
{17951}{18043}That's an exciting job. You must|have a ton of responsibilities...
{18049}{18083}I don't do the casting.
{18089}{18171}So what are you guys gonna eat?
{18180}{18279}How come all I can think about is|putting that ice in my mouth...
{18285}{18391}...and licking you all over?
{18400}{18536}Because I went to an all-boys high|school, and God is making up for it?
{18605}{18650}I want you right here...
{18656}{18694}...right now.
{18700}{18744}Right now, right here?
{18750}{18849}Don't you think we're in|kind of a public place?
{18887}{18961}They do have the shrimp.
{18986}{19072}Meet me in the bathroom.
{19191}{19273}I'm going to the bathroom now.
{19467}{19535}Come on.
{19551}{19590}All right, mister.
{19596}{19665}Let's see those panties.
{19671}{19746}Alrighty.
{19796}{19874}But you know what|would be even sexier?
{19880}{19913}What?
{19919}{20026}If you didn't have|your shirt tucked into them.
{20054}{20163}All right. Now, I would like|to see you wearing nothing but them.
{20169}{20224}Take your clothes off.
{20230}{20376}I hope you realize this means|we'll miss hearing about the specials.
{20382}{20403}Come on, hurry!
{20409}{20486}Do you want this done quick|or done right?
{20492}{20591}All right, turn around.|I wanna see you from behind.
{20597}{20696}Somebody's been doing|his "Buns of Steel" video.
{20702}{20825}So you want me|to clench anything or...?
{20849}{20919}Susie?
{20933}{21022}This is for the fourth grade.
{21069}{21112}- What do you mean?|- What do I mean?
{21118}{21143}What do I mean?!
{21149}{21234}I mean underpants, mister!|That's what I mean!
{21240}{21273}What? What do you mean?
{21279}{21308}My skirt...
{21314}{21380}...you lifted. Kids laughing!
{21386}{21483}I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!
{21496}{21611}That was in fourth grade!|How could you still be upset?
{21614}{21746}Call me in 20 years and tell me|if you're still upset about this.
{21831}{21951}I hope you realize you're not|getting these underpants back!
{22153}{22193}I can't believe this.
{22199}{22278}Just two weeks ago,|I was watching "Sudden Death"...
{22284}{22367}...and now I'm on a date|with Jean-Claude Van Damme.
{22373}{22451}Can you beat up that guy?
{22454}{22515}- Can you beat up that guy?|- Sure.
{22521}{22577}This is so wild.
{22583}{22703}I gotta admit, I was surprised|that you agreed to go on a blind date.
{22709}{22784}Normally, I would not do it.
{22790}{22860}What made you make|the exception for me?
{22866}{22892}Rachel told me...
{22898}{22987}...you were dying to have a threesome|with me and Drew Barrymore.
{22993}{23106}By the way, Drew has|some ground rules and...
{23121}{23157}Say you're sorry!
{23163}{23189}Say it!
{23195}{23276}No! I'm not gonna!
{23279}{23376}Say it! Say it!|Great!
{23393}{23499}Say you're sorry|or your sweater gets it.
{23501}{23614}That is my favorite sweater!|That is my third-date sweater!
{23616}{23688}Say you're sorry.
{23694}{23765}You wanna play?|Okay, let's play.
{23771}{23834}Let's play.
{23936}{23959}What'll you do?
{23965}{24070}Give me back my sweater|or it's handbag marinara.
{24111}{24155}You don't have the guts.
{24161}{24288}Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken|to tell some guy he was cute.
{24496}{24607}Stop! Stop the madness!
{24658}{24695}This is crazy!
{24701}{24810}Who can remember why|you're fighting in the first place?
{24886}{24955}Yes, that's right.
{24974}{25018}But still...
{25024}{25082}Look at your purse!
{25088}{25152}Look at your sweater!
{25158}{25241}Look at yourselves!
{25286}{25336}I'll help you fix your sweater.
{25342}{25375}I'll help you...
{25381}{25462}...throw out your purse.
{25465}{25548}I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.
{25554}{25675}I'm sorry I went out with him|when I knew you liked him.
{25684}{25794}I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.
{26253}{26274}Joey?
{26280}{26341}Ma?
{26411}{26492}What are you doing here?|I thought you guys took off.
{26498}{26582}She took off with my clothes!
{26611}{26713}- Are you naked in there?|- Well, not exactly.
{26720}{26801}I'm wearing panties.
{26866}{26934}You always wear panties?
{26940}{27034}No, no. This is the first time.
{27040}{27118}Talk about your bad luck!
{27124}{27247}The first time you try panties and|someone walks off with your clothes.
{27253}{27350}I was not trying them out.|Susie asked me to wear them.
{27356}{27375}Let me see!
{27381}{27466}No! I'm not letting you|or anybody else see, ever!
{27472}{27549}All right, all right!
{27641}{27729}Someone's flossing!
{27831}{27929}Joey, some people don't like that.
{27936}{27977}Chandler's wearing panties.
{27983}{28012}What?
{28018}{28115}- Let me see!|- You don't have to see!
{28121}{28195}Hi, tushy!
{28199}{28271}One of you give me your underpants.
{28277}{28346}I'm not wearing any.
{28373}{28417}How can you not be wearing any?
{28423}{28535}I'm getting heat from the guy|in the hot pink thong.
{28541}{28674}Look, Ross. I'll give you|$50 for your underpants.
{29284}{29347}- Can I have the milk?|- I'm almost done with it.
{29353}{29430}Keep your panties on.
{29544}{29597}And I'm in the movie!
{29603}{29663}- What happened?|- A virus victim called in sick...
{29669}{29797}...so Cathy recommended me and boom!|I'm dying on a gurney!
{29803}{29928}Marcel just finished his last scene,|if you wanna go say goodbye.
{29934}{30069}That's okay. He's probably|got parties to go to and stuff.
{30087}{30209}He's moved on.|That's the way it goes, right?
{30218}{30255}Oh, my God!
{30261}{30318}What?
{30405}{30491}{y:i}Looks like we made it
{30497}{30568}{y:i}Left each other on the way...
{30574}{30651}{y:i}... to another love
{30737}{30826}{y:i}Looks like we made it
{30832}{30904}{y:i}Or I thought so, till today
{30910}{31008}{y:i}Until you were there, everywhere
{31014}{31167}{y:i}And all I could taste was|{y:i}Love the way we made it
{31231}{31325}{y:i}Looks like we made it
{31394}{31496}I think I want to write|a song about all this.
{31502}{31586}Except one of the strings|on my guitar is broken.
{31592}{31663}Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
{31669}{31789}- How long you been waiting to say that?|- About 20 minutes!
{31890}{32000}Can't you see what's going on here?|This man is dying!
{32013}{32049}Cut!
{32055}{32175}Can't you see what's going on here?|This man is dying!
{32184}{32242}Cut!

{2781}{2848}I can't believe two cows|made the ultimate sacrifice...
{2854}{2910}...so you could watch TV|with your feet up.
{2916}{2982}No, they were chair-shaped cows.
{2988}{3059}They never would have survived|in the wild.
{3065}{3204}This screen is amazing.|Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.
{3229}{3320}Rose Marie belongs on|a smaller screen, doesn't she?
{3326}{3387}Hi, you guys.
{3393}{3464}Hey, you.
{3593}{3619}How was your day?
{3625}{3683}You know, pretty much the usual.
{3689}{3731}Sun shining, birds chirping.
{3737}{3764}Really? Mine too.
{3770}{3856}Hey, cool! Mine too!
{3896}{3962}I gotta get to the museum.

{4264}{4331}Tonight?
{4359}{4420}- What's tonight?|- Our first official date.
{4426}{4507}Our first date.
{4510}{4555}Hello?
{4561}{4625}Hi.
{4629}{4699}You're supposed to waitress for me?|My catering thing?
{4705}{4790}- Any of that trigger anything?|- Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!
{4796}{4832}This is our first date.

{4916}{4991}Thank you, thank you.|See? Phoebe! Phoebe!
{4997}{5070}Really, Pheebs?|You'd have to be an actual waitress.
{5076}{5148}This can't be like your|"I can be a bear cub" thing.
{5154}{5214}I can be a waitress.|Okay, watch this.
{5220}{5274}Give me two number ones,|86 the bacon...
{5280}{5381}...one Adam and Eve on a raft|and wreck them!
{5686}{5749}It's James Bond!
{5768}{5844}- Sorry we're late.|- That's okay. Come on in.
{5850}{5917}Is Monica Geller coming?|I was told she was.
{5923}{5967}Dr. Burke, it's me.
{5973}{6005}Monica?
{6011}{6059}My God! You used to be so...
{6065}{6183}I mean, you've...|You must have lost like...
{6214}{6244}You look great.
{6250}{6269}Thank you.
{6275}{6327}This is Phoebe.|She'll be helping me.
{6333}{6405}Nice to meet you.
{6489}{6564}- So how you been?|- Great. How have you been?
{6570}{6620}Obviously you know|Barbara and I split up...
{6626}{6672}...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.
{6678}{6709}The head tilt?
{6715}{6770}Since the divorce,|everybody asks how I am...
{6776}{6877}...with a sympathetic head tilt.|"How you doing? You okay?"
{6883}{6920}I'm sorry.
{6926}{6979}It's fine.|Believe me, I do it too.
{6985}{7087}I always answer with the|"I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."
{7093}{7112}"You're sure?"
{7118}{7163}"Yeah, I'm fine."
{7169}{7230}I gotta set up the music.|I got a new CD changer.
{7236}{7330}Of course, the divorce only left|me with four CDs to change.
{7336}{7377}That's too bad.
{7383}{7461}I'll survive.
{7513}{7597}Two larges, extra cheese on both.
{7603}{7637}But listen...
{7643}{7705}...don't ring the buzzer for 19.
{7711}{7775}Ring 20. Geller/Greene.
{7781}{7881}They'll let you in, okay?
{7903}{7995}If you buzz our door,|there's no tip for you.
{8001}{8071}Okay, thanks.
{8084}{8192}Pizza's on the way.|I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
{8198}{8281}What if we have to pee?
{8321}{8411}I'll cancel the sodas.
{8473}{8519}Get back out there.|It's your party!
{8525}{8605}But they're so dull!|They're all ophthalmologists.
{8611}{8642}You're an ophthalmologist.
{8648}{8764}Because my parents wanted me to be.|I wanted to be a sheriff.
{8783}{8854}That's funny.|Cadillac, cataract. I get it.
{8860}{8930}But you stay out there!
{8936}{8977}- You see?|- I tell you what.
{8983}{9130}I'll come get you in five minutes|with some sort of kebob emergency.
{9136}{9159}Better.
{9165}{9213}Oh, God, here we go.
{9219}{9268}Hey, want to see them go nuts?
{9274}{9325}Watch this.
{9331}{9407}Who needs glasses?
{9549}{9590}You are so smitten.
{9596}{9629}I am not!
{9635}{9728}Oh, you are so much|the smitten kitten.
{9740}{9790}- You should ask him out.|- Dr. Burke?
{9796}{9905}I don't think so.|I mean, like, he's a grownup.
{9911}{9993}So? You two are|totally into each other.
{9999}{10082}He's a friend of my parents.|He's like 20 years older than me.
{10088}{10153}So you're never gonna see him again?
{10159}{10205}Not never.
{10211}{10302}I'm gonna see him tomorrow|at my eye appointment.
{10308}{10395}- Didn't you just get your eyes checked?|- Yeah, but you know...
{10401}{10448}...27 is...
{10454}{10540}...a dangerous eye age.
{10621}{10724}I'm not saying it was a bad movie.|I'm just saying it was a little...
{10730}{10768}...hard to follow.
{10774}{10820}I told you there'd be subtitles.
{10826}{10887}I know.
{10890}{11011}I just didn't want to wear|my glasses on our first date.
{11171}{11233}Monica?
{11284}{11395}It would help when I'm kissing|if you didn't shout my sister's name.
{11401}{11460}Honey, I'm just checking.
{11466}{11537}- Monica?|- Mon?
{12260}{12305}What?
{12311}{12339}I'm sorry.
{12345}{12418}It's just, when you moved|your hands down to my butt...
{12424}{12531}...it was, like, "Whoa!|Ross' hands are on my butt!"
{12549}{12630}And that's funny. Why?
{12636}{12675}Well, it's not.
{12681}{12734}I'm sorry.|I guess I'm just nervous.
{12740}{12787}I mean, it's you.
{12793}{12830}You know, it's us.
{12836}{12924}We're crossing that line.|It's sort of a big thing.
{12930}{13071}Well, I know it's big.|I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.
{13313}{13379}Okay, my hands were|nowhere near your butt.
{13385}{13419}I know, I know, I know!
{13425}{13500}I was thinking about when|they were there the last time.
{13506}{13566}I'm sorry, I'm sorry.|Okay, look! I promise.
{13572}{13644}I won't laugh anymore.|Put your hands back there.
{13650}{13732}No, see, now I can't.
{13738}{13828}- I feel self-conscious.|- Just one cheek.
{13829}{13852}The moment's gone.
{13858}{13934}- I'll back up into your hands.|- That's romantic.
{13940}{13960}{y:i}- Touch it.|{y:i}- No.
{13966}{14010}{y:i}- Oh, come on, squeeze it.|{y:i}- No!
{14016}{14038}{y:i}Rub it?
{14044}{14146}{y:i}Oh, come on!|{y:i}Would you just grab my ass?
{14305}{14385}Wow! Look at that!|The car is on fire...
{14391}{14464}...yet somehow|its expensive paint job...
{14470}{14586}...is protected by the Miracle Wax.
{14598}{14691}You've got a Cheeto|on your face, man.
{14924}{14989}Aren't you supposed|to be out with Rachel?
{14995}{15073}That was 14 hours ago.
{15079}{15124}So how'd it go?
{15130}{15240}Have you ever been, you know,|fooling around with a girl...
{15246}{15326}...and she started laughing?
{15346}{15379}But it was 1982...
{15385}{15511}...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut|was tickling her chin.
{15550}{15591}She laughed at you?
{15597}{15668}I've been wanting this|since ninth grade typing.
{15674}{15750}And I just want it to be perfect...
{15756}{15825}...and right and...
{15831}{15908}Why isn't that laser beam|cutting through the paint?
{15914}{15992}- It's the Miracle Wax!|- It certainly is a miracle.
{15998}{16053}Hi, you guys.
{16086}{16144}Listen, I was thinking about...
{16150}{16183}Can you guys speak up?
{16189}{16301}It's harder for us to hear you|when you lower your voice.
{16334}{16444}I'm sorry about last night.|I really want to make it up to you.
{16450}{16504}There's no need to make it up...
{16510}{16571}How?
{16575}{16670}Well, I was thinking|maybe a romantic dinner...
{16676}{16767}...with candles and wine.
{16773}{16879}And then maybe going|back to my place...
{16885}{16954}...for dessert.
{16960}{16994}That sounds...
{17000}{17066}...perfect?
{17228}{17249}What's this?
{17255}{17346}Would you get us a couple of beers?
{17440}{17499}I'm going to look into your eyes now.
{17505}{17550}Really?
{17556}{17616}That's my job.
{17623}{17642}All right.
{17648}{17705}Look up.
{17711}{17734}Look down.
{17740}{17808}Now, open your eyes and look down.
{17814}{17842}That's right.
{17848}{17913}Look into the light.
{17919}{17996}Now look at me.
{18234}{18304}Your eyes look good.|Those are good eyes.
{18310}{18368}Good. They feel good.
{18374}{18436}In my head.
{18531}{18614}- It was great to see you.|- You too.
{18620}{18677}You too.
{18758}{18822}Goodbye.
{18836}{18892}Drops!
{18898}{18972}Here, they're free.
{19006}{19068}Thanks.
{19080}{19109}I better be going.
{19115}{19155}Yeah, I'll see you later.
{19161}{19231}Thanks again.
{19536}{19637}We have to get you lazy boys|out of these chairs.
{19689}{19792}You should go outside and be with|the three-dimensional people.
{19798}{19883}No. Inside good.
{19889}{19957}Outside bad.
{19963}{20014}You guys are so pathetic.
{20020}{20092}Oh, "Xanadu"!
{20150}{20241}She's one of us now.
{20311}{20375}We just wanted to stop by|and say good night.
{20381}{20432}Good night.
{20438}{20483}They won't even turn their heads.
{20489}{20596}All right, you guys.|I'm taking off my shirt.
{20701}{20780}She's lying.
{20785}{20916}Stop sending food to our apartment!
{20916}{20947}Why are you dressed up?
{20953}{20997}You're not the only one|with a date.
{21003}{21060}- What? You have a date? Who with?|- No one.
{21066}{21106}Come on, what's his name?
{21112}{21145}Nothing.
{21151}{21193}Come on, tell me.
{21199}{21267}All right, but I'm very excited|about this, okay?
{21273}{21345}So promise you won't get|big-brothery and judgmental.
{21351}{21383}I promise. What?
{21389}{21447}- It's Richard Burke.|- Who's Richard Burke?
{21453}{21508}Dr. Burke?
{21514}{21590}You have a date with Dr. Burke?|Why? Why? Why...
{21596}{21654}...should that bother me?
{21660}{21703}I love that man.|He's like a...
{21709}{21777}...a brother to Dad.
{21783}{21901}He is the brightest, most sophisticated,|sexiest man I've ever been with.
{21907}{21935}Dr. Burke is sexy?
{21941}{22042}Oh, God! Absolutely!
{22053}{22080}Damn!
{22086}{22173}It's the museum again.|Can I...?
{22173}{22229}- Dr. Burke kissed me once.|- When?
{22235}{22334}When I was 7, I crashed my bike|right out in front of his house...
{22340}{22429}...and to stop me from crying,|he kissed me right here.
{22435}{22507}- Oh, you are so lucky!|- I know.
{22513}{22641}Australopithecus isn't supposed|to be in that display.
{22649}{22754}No, Homo habilis was erect.|Australopithecus was never fully erect.
{22760}{22846}Well, maybe he was nervous.
{22981}{23040}Oh, look!|I can't believe this!
{23046}{23145}Homo habilis can't use tools yet,|and they've got him with clay pots?
{23151}{23237}Why don't they just|give him a microwave?
{23243}{23294}I'm sorry this is taking so long.
{23300}{23372}It's longer than I expected.|We will have dinner.
{23378}{23400}That's okay.
{23406}{23478}Karl!
{23495}{23571}Oh, God.
{23838}{23904}- Wow! Is that Michelle?|- Yep.
{23910}{23972}I've not seen her since|high-school graduation.
{23978}{24086}Oh, my God, that night|she got so dru...
{24108}{24139}Emotional.
{24145}{24203}You know, she's having another baby.
{24209}{24304}- I thought she just had one.|- No, no. Henry's almost 2.
{24310}{24405}And he's talking|and everything. Here.
{24411}{24503}The other day he told me he liked me|better than his other grandpa.
{24509}{24626}In all fairness, his other|grandpa's a drunk, but still...
{24658}{24736}You're a grandpa.
{24926}{24975}Are we nuts here?
{24981}{25048}I don't know. Maybe.
{25054}{25150}I mean, I'm dating a man|whose pool I once peed in.
{25156}{25227}I didn't need to know that.
{25233}{25295}I guess 21 years is a lot.
{25301}{25451}I mean, hell, I'm a whole person|who can drink older than you.
{25653}{25761}So maybe we should just...
{25794}{25854}Maybe...
{25920}{25981}Wow.
{26010}{26042}This really sucks.
{26048}{26141}Yeah, it sure does.
{26527}{26604}We don't really have to decide|anything right now, do we?
{26610}{26694}No, there's no rush or anything.
{26700}{26821}- Pizza delivery!|- Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!
{26896}{26942}I'm done.
{26948}{27023}Yeah, well, you know what?|So is Sorentino's.
{27029}{27107}I'm sorry.|Why don't we find someplace else?
{27113}{27195}It's late. Everything will be closed.|We'll do it another night.
{27201}{27234}No, no, we won't.
{27240}{27283}We won't?
{27289}{27328}Come on.
{27334}{27417}Okay, that's dead, right?
{27436}{27474}What are we doing?
{27480}{27601}- Do you want Cranapple or Cran-Grape?|- Grape.
{27619}{27655}Okay, now...
{27661}{27726}...sit.
{27803}{27875}Oh, my God!
{27881}{28001}{y:i}Billions of years ago,|{y:i}Earth was only...
{28011}{28073}Sorry.
{28164}{28213}So what are we looking at?
{28219}{28322}Well, you see that little cluster|of stars next to the big one?
{28328}{28395}That is Ursa Major.
{28401}{28511}- Really?|- No idea. It could be.
{28551}{28614}Listen, I'm sorry|I had to work tonight.
{28620}{28665}Oh, that's okay.
{28671}{28735}You were worth the wait.
{28741}{28831}And I don't just mean tonight.
{29026}{29075}You're not laughing.
{29081}{29171}This time it's not so funny.
{29927}{29986}Oh, God!
{29990}{30018}Honey?
{30024}{30079}That's okay.
{30085}{30127}What?
{30133}{30242}Oh, no. You just rolled|over the juice bo x.
{30405}{30483}Thank God!
{31166}{31231}Hey, you.
{31346}{31419}I can't believe I'm waking up|next to you.
{31425}{31514}I know. It is pretty unbel...
{31539}{31621}We're not alone.
{32229}{32316}Is that the fire alarm?
{32399}{32490}It's not warm yet.|We still have time.
{32496}{32592}- Cool.|{y:i}- Yeah, yeah. Cool!

{161}{224}Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's|eyebrows are on his hat?
{230}{256}That's what's weird?
{262}{369}The man's been captain|of a cereal for 40 years.
{435}{459}What?
{465}{565}The spoon!|You licked and you put.
{587}{638}You licked and you put.
{644}{679}Yeah, so?
{685}{798}Don't you see how gross that is?|It's like you using my toothbrush!
{804}{873}You used my toothbrush?
{877}{987}Only because I used the red one|to unclog the drain.
{993}{1053}Mine is the red one!
{1059}{1184}Oh, God!|Can open. Worms everywhere!
{1190}{1247}Why can't we use the same toothbrush...
{1253}{1300}...but we can use the same soap?
{1306}{1414}Because soap is soap.|It's self-cleaning.
{1420}{1459}The next time you shower...
{1465}{1595}...think about the last thing I wash|and the first thing you wash.

{2818}{2892}Look at you fancy lads!
{2898}{2923}What's the occasion?
{2929}{3016}You know that guy on my show|that's in a coma?
{3022}{3087}He's having a brunch.
{3093}{3152}Ready when you are.
{3158}{3219}I can't believe you're|actually getting tattoos.
{3225}{3273}You guys are getting tattoos?
{3279}{3359}But you cannot tell Ross|because I wanna surprise him.
{3365}{3432}Wow, this is wild!|What are you gonna get?
{3438}{3509}I'm getting a lily.
{3515}{3599}For my mom, because her name's Lily.
{3605}{3720}That's lucky. What if|her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
{3732}{3775}- Where you getting it?|- On my shoulder.
{3781}{3808}What?
{3814}{3864}What's on your shoulder?
{3870}{3930}A chip.
{3959}{4028}- A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.|- A tattoo?
{4034}{4125}Why? Why would you wanna do that?
{4129}{4178}You don't think|they're kind of cool?
{4184}{4228}No. Sorry, I don't.
{4234}{4313}Why would anyone pay someone|to scar their body for life?
{4319}{4368}What if it doesn't come out right?
{4374}{4485}It's like having|a bad haircut all the time.
{4490}{4548}Why is everyone staring at me?
{4554}{4613}Sign this card for Dad.|Richard will be here soon.
{4619}{4663}Richard's going to the party too?
{4669}{4725}He's my parents' best friend.|He has to go.
{4731}{4809}So is today the day|you'll tell them about you two?
{4815}{4928}Yeah, for my dad's birthday,|I decided to give him a stroke.
{4934}{4989}No, I think you should tell them.
{4995}{5076}I don't know how serious he is.|Until I do, I won't say anything.
{5082}{5137}I don't think|Mom and Dad would mind.
{5143}{5214}Remember when you were 9|and Richard was 30, Dad said...
{5220}{5301}..."God, I hope they get together."
{5394}{5415}Shall we?
{5421}{5464}Okay, wait.
{5470}{5504}You know what?
{5510}{5586}Ross, let's switch places.|You get in the middle.
{5592}{5670}This looks like we're trying|to cover something up.
{5676}{5800}You could come in straddling him,|they still wouldn't believe it.
{5825}{5855}We're here!
{5861}{5929}- Hi, kids!|- The children!
{5935}{6007}- Happy birthday, Dad.|- Thank you.
{6013}{6033}Happy birthday!
{6039}{6098}So you kids thanked|Dr. Burke for the ride?
{6104}{6235}Actually, Mom, I think Monica|thanked him for the both of us.
{6240}{6287}So you kids take the train in?
{6293}{6352}No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
{6358}{6389}Speaking of whom...
{6395}{6525}...I hear he's got some|20-year-old twinkie in the city.
{6579}{6629}Finger cramp! Oh, God!
{6635}{6728}Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.
{6739}{6828}So Richard's shopping|in the junior section?
{6834}{6869}Are we still on that?
{6875}{6968}You just know she's got|the IQ of a napkin.
{6974}{7008}She's probably not even pretty.
{7014}{7140}Just young enough so that|everything is still pointing up.
{7303}{7329}{y:i}Can you believe this place?
{7335}{7379}I know. This is a great apartment.
{7385}{7454}In the bathroom there's mirrors|on both sides of you.
{7460}{7547}When you're in there, it's like|peeing with the Rockettes.
{7553}{7621}Well, there's my fantasy come true.
{7627}{7684}Seriously.
{7705}{7753}We were just saying, great apartment!
{7759}{7805}Thanks. You want it?
{7811}{7846}I'm moving to a bigger place.
{7852}{7902}You should take this one.
{7908}{7959}Can you see me in a place like this?
{7965}{8039}Why not? You hate park views|and high ceilings?
{8045}{8130}Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.
{8134}{8194}That's all right,|I saw a kitchen this morning.
{8200}{8224}On TV.
{8230}{8311}Stop talking. Okay!
{8317}{8377}- Come on, tell us!|- Is she really 20?
{8383}{8428}I am not telling you guys anything.
{8434}{8513}Come on, it's my birthday.|Let me live vicariously!
{8519}{8569}Dad, you really don't want to do that.
{8575}{8639}What's a little midlife crisis|between friends?
{8645}{8680}Would you let it go?
{8686}{8767}I know what you're going through.|When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.
{8773}{8841}You got your own little speedster.
{8847}{8916}- Seriously, it's not like that.|- Tell you what.
{8922}{9017}Maybe one of these weekends|you can borrow the car and I could...
{9023}{9083}Dad, I beg you not|to finish that sentence!
{9089}{9130}What? I'm kidding!
{9136}{9240}You know I'd never let him|touch the Porsche.
{9385}{9434}Okay, Rach.
{9440}{9508}Which lily?|This lily or that lily?
{9514}{9569}- Well, I...|- I like this lily.
{9575}{9633}It's more open|and that's like my mom.
{9639}{9704}She had a more open, giving spirit.
{9710}{9795}Foghorn Leghorn!
{9800}{9852}Blonde girl?|You're in room two.
{9858}{9929}Not-so-blonde girl, you're with me.
{9935}{9992}Here we go!
{9998}{10061}You're not going.
{10067}{10153}Is this because of what Ross said?
{10184}{10245}- Well, yeah, maybe.|- I don't believe this.
{10251}{10365}Is this how this relationship works?|Ross equals boss?
{10371}{10431}Come on, what is this, 1922?
{10437}{10484}What's 1922?
{10490}{10574}Just, you know, a long time ago.
{10581}{10660}When men used to tell women|what to do a lot.
{10666}{10788}Then there was suffrage, which was|a good thing. But it sounds horrible.
{10834}{10867}Do you want this tattoo?
{10873}{10941}Yes, I do.|It's just that Ross...
{10947}{11030}Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
{11071}{11145}Who is the boss of you?
{11145}{11210}You?
{11210}{11259}You are the boss of you!
{11265}{11344}You march in there and|get that tattoo on your hip!
{11350}{11420}Go!
{11530}{11558}How you doing?
{11564}{11623}I'm a twinkie!
{11629}{11720}Really? I'm a hero.
{11749}{11789}This is so hard.
{11795}{11869}Yeah, I know. I hate it too.
{11875}{11939}Look, maybe we should just tell them.
{11945}{12016}Maybe we should just tell|your parents first.
{12022}{12082}My parents are dead.
{12088}{12180}God, you are so lucky!
{12185}{12251}I mean...|Well, you know what I mean.
{12257}{12314}Just hang in there, okay?
{12320}{12420}Okay, I'll go out first, all right?
{12514}{12629}Judy! Going to the bathroom.|Good for you!
{12669}{12795}Thank you, Richard.|I appreciate the support.
{12857}{12896}Honey.
{12902}{12974}Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?|Bob doesn't believe I have one.
{12980}{13024}I have no idea.
{13030}{13124}Did you know Richard|has a twinkie in the city?
{13133}{13229}I know. He's a new man.|It's like a scene from "Cocoon".
{13235}{13312}I just never would have|pictured Richard with a bimbo.
{13318}{13386}He told Johnny Shapiro|that she's quite a girl.
{13392}{13477}He told Johnny that he thinks|he's falling in love with her.
{13483}{13543}- Really?|- I've never seen him this happy.
{13549}{13588}So, Jack...
{13594}{13657}...ever think about trading me in|for a younger model?
{13663}{13713}Of course not.
{13719}{13817}With you, it's like|I've got two 25-year-olds.
{13890}{13928}Oh, Jack, stop!
{13934}{13989}Come on!
{13995}{14090}It's my birthday!
{14155}{14183}Can we drop this?
{14189}{14243}I am not interested|in the guy's apartment.
{14249}{14351}Oh, please. I saw the way|you were checking out his moldings.
{14357}{14377}You want it.
{14383}{14433}Why would I want another apartment?
{14439}{14491}I've already got|an apartment that I love.
{14497}{14585}It wouldn't kill you|to say it once in a while.
{14638}{14754}All right. You want the truth?|I'm thinking about it.
{14760}{14798}- What?|- I'm sorry.
{14804}{14872}I'm 28. I've never lived alone...
{14878}{14948}...and I'm at a place|where I got enough money...
{14954}{15019}...that I don't need a roommate.
{15025}{15073}I don't need a roommate either.
{15079}{15140}I can afford to live here by myself.
{15146}{15254}I may have to bring in somebody|once a week to lick the silverware.
{15260}{15312}Why are you getting|so bent out of shape?
{15318}{15373}We didn't agree to live|together forever.
{15379}{15455}We're not Bert and Ernie.
{15469}{15494}You know what?
{15500}{15543}If this is the way you feel...
{15549}{15609}...then maybe you should take it.
{15615}{15666}- That's how I feel.|- Then maybe you should take it!
{15672}{15693}Maybe I will!
{15699}{15731}- Fine with me!|- Great!
{15737}{15802}You can spend more quality time|with your real friends...
{15808}{15867}...the spoons!
{15873}{15960}Whose drink can I freshen?
{15963}{16045}Almost time for cake!
{16266}{16304}Mon, are you okay?
{16310}{16411}You remember that video|I found of Mom and Dad?
{16417}{16510}Well, I just caught the live show.
{16767}{16828}- Hey, there.|- What?
{16834}{16949}Nothing. I just heard|something nice about you.
{16955}{17016}Really?
{17055}{17138}- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?|- Not that I know of.
{17144}{17264}I was thinking, why doesn't|he give Monica a call?
{17315}{17357}That's an idea.
{17363}{17437}Well, actually,|I'm already seeing someone.
{17443}{17510}Oh?
{17570}{17614}She never tells us anything.
{17620}{17678}Ross, did you know|Monica's seeing someone?
{17684}{17771}Mom, there are|so many people in my life.
{17777}{17841}Some are seeing people|and some aren't.
{17847}{17925}Is that crystal?
{17953}{18007}So who's the mystery man?
{18013}{18070}Well, he's a doctor.
{18076}{18110}A real doctor?
{18116}{18179}No, a doctor of meat.
{18185}{18233}Of course he's a real doctor.
{18239}{18294}And he's handsome.
{18300}{18366}And he's sweet,|and I know you'd like him.
{18372}{18456}Well, that's wonderful.
{18564}{18613}Mom, it's okay.
{18619}{18642}It is, Judy.
{18648}{18720}Jack!
{18729}{18799}Could you come in here for a moment?
{18805}{18844}Now!
{18850}{18950}- Found it!|- I'll take that, Dad.
{19001}{19116}It seems your daughter and Richard|are something of an item.
{19122}{19231}That's impossible.|He's got a twinkie in the city.
{19237}{19272}I'm the twinkie.
{19278}{19336}- You're the twinkie?|- She's not a twinkie!
{19342}{19407}Look, this is the best relationship|I've been in...
{19413}{19478}Oh, please! A relationship?
{19484}{19517}Yes, a relationship!
{19523}{19576}For your information,|I'm crazy about this man.
{19582}{19642}Really?
{19660}{19764}Am I supposed to stand here|and listen to this on my birthday?
{19770}{19869}This is a good thing. You said|you've never seen Richard happier.
{19875}{19894}When did I say that?
{19900}{20006}Upstairs in the bathroom,|right before you felt up Mom!
{20012}{20068}{y:i}Happy birthday to you
{20074}{20159}{y:i}Happy birthday to you
{20165}{20274}{y:i}Happy birthday, dear Jack
{20280}{20414}{y:i}Happy birthday to you
{20420}{20498}It looks so good!|Oh, I love it.
{20504}{20577}I know, so do I!|I'm so glad you made me do this.
{20583}{20665}Okay, let me see yours.
{20717}{20774}Let's see yours again.
{20780}{20880}We just saw mine.|Let me see yours.
{20912}{20967}Oh, no!
{20973}{21029}It's gone! That's so weird.
{21035}{21130}I don't know how, where it went.
{21155}{21212}You didn't get it?
{21224}{21245}Why not?
{21251}{21286}I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
{21292}{21352}How could you do this to me?|This was your idea!
{21358}{21443}I know! I was gonna get it,|but he came in with this needle.
{21449}{21536}And did you know|they do this with needles?
{21542}{21582}Really? You don't say?
{21588}{21695}Because mine was licked on by kittens!
{21764}{21799}I'm sorry about what...
{21805}{21876}- Yeah, me too.|- I know.
{21933}{22003}Do we need to hug?
{22012}{22085}No, we're all right.
{22085}{22149}So I got you something.
{22155}{22223}Plastic spoons!
{22243}{22326}- Great!|- Lick away, my man!
{22332}{22435}These will go great in my new place|till I get real ones.
{22441}{22472}What?
{22478}{22588}I can't use these forever.|They're no friend of the environment.
{22594}{22668}No, I mean what's this|about your new place?
{22674}{22716}I'm moving out,|like we talked about.
{22722}{22805}I didn't think that was serious.
{22823}{22883}You know, I thought|that was just a fight.
{22889}{22929}Well, it was a fight...
{22935}{22989}...based on serious stuff, remember?
{22995}{23046}About how I never|lived alone or anything?
{23052}{23129}I think it would be good for me.|Help me to grow...
{23135}{23198}...or whatever.
{23262}{23340}Well, there you go.
{23345}{23399}Hey, are you cool with this?
{23405}{23446}I don't wanna leave you high and dry.
{23452}{23531}I've never been lower or wetter.
{23555}{23604}I'll be fine.|I'll just turn your...
{23610}{23647}...bedroom into a game room.
{23653}{23745}Put the foosball table in there.
{23752}{23840}Why do you get to keep the table?
{23867}{23955}I did pay for half of it.
{23995}{24028}I paid for the other half.
{24034}{24114}I'll tell you what.|I'll play you for it.
{24120}{24148}All right, you're on.
{24154}{24253}I can take two minutes|out of my day to kick your ass.
{24259}{24380}Your men will get scored on|more times than your sister.
{24524}{24599}Which sister?
{24645}{24699}So are you sorry that I told them?
{24705}{24840}No. It's been a long time|since your dad and I went running.
{24910}{24934}Did you get it?
{24940}{24983}- Is Ross here?|- He went out for pizza.
{24989}{25060}Okay, really quick.
{25064}{25089}That's great!
{25095}{25144}Very tasteful.
{25150}{25194}Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?
{25200}{25239}What? You didn't get one.
{25245}{25345}Okay. Well then, what is this?
{25365}{25418}What are we looking at?
{25424}{25505}That blue freckle?
{25507}{25539}That's my tattoo.
{25545}{25611}That is not a tattoo.|That is a nothing.
{25617}{25649}I got her in the chair...
{25655}{25748}...he barely touched her with the|needle, she screamed and that was it.
{25754}{25830}Okay, hi!
{25843}{25944}For your information,|this is exactly what I wanted.
{25950}{26076}This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen|from a great, great distance.
{26088}{26174}It's the way my mother|sees me from heaven.
{26180}{26272}Oh, what a load of crap!
{26278}{26311}That is a dot!
{26317}{26465}Your mother's in heaven going,|"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"
{26477}{26587}That is not a tattoo!|This is a tattoo!
{26658}{26726}You got a tattoo?
{26732}{26784}Maybe.
{26790}{26895}But just a little one.|Phoebe got the whole world!
{26909}{26985}Well, let me see.
{27029}{27061}Well?
{27067}{27140}Well, it's really...
{27145}{27179}...sexy.
{27185}{27258}I wouldn't have thought|it would be, but...
{27264}{27327}...wow!
{27362}{27419}Really?
{27443}{27552}So is it sore?|Or can you do stuff?
{27582}{27621}I guess.
{27627}{27692}Save us some pizza.
{27820}{27890}Get it out of the corner!
{27898}{27931}Pass it! Pass it!
{27937}{28020}Stop talking to your men!
{28048}{28127}And the table is mine.
{28188}{28265}Congratulations.
{28537}{28589}You guys will still|come visit me, right?
{28595}{28636}Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.
{28642}{28706}We'll be over there all the time.
{28712}{28799}Except when we are here.
{28875}{28947}I know you're just moving uptown,|but I'll really miss you.
{28953}{29027}How can you not be|across the hall anymore?
{29033}{29133}Who's gonna eat all of our food|and tie up our phone lines...
{29139}{29220}Is that my bra?
{29235}{29326}- What are you doing with my bra?|- It's not what you think.
{29332}{29429}We used it to fling|water balloons off the roof.
{29435}{29534}Remember? Those kids couldn't|even get theirs across the street.
{29540}{29604}Yeah, I remember.
{29635}{29745}Let's bring the rest of these|down to the truck.
{30000}{30044}You want me to...
{30050}{30140}...give you a hand|with the foosball table?
{30145}{30248}You keep it.|You need the practice.
{30271}{30312}Thanks.
{30318}{30358}So...
{30364}{30399}...I guess this is it.
{30405}{30429}Yeah, right.
{30435}{30503}I guess so.
{30599}{30634}When am I gonna see you?
{30640}{30690}I'm guessing tonight|at the coffeehouse.
{30696}{30771}Right. Yeah. Okay.

{261}{292}We wanna see the end.
{298}{329}{y:i}I want you, Drake.

{517}{620}{y:i}I'm actually your half-brother.
{713}{751}So what happens next?
{757}{836}I get the medical award|for separating the Siamese twins.

{2948}{3038}Why don't you play with your roommate?
{3040}{3086}He's not a big fan of foosball.
{3092}{3156}Are we not getting along|with the new boy?
{3162}{3256}No, he's all right. He spends|most of his time in his room.
{3262}{3322}That's because you haven't|gotten to know him.
{3328}{3371}Let's remedy that, shall we?
{3377}{3461}- We don't need to.|- It'll be fun!
{3506}{3563}What was that?

{3702}{3741}Oh, good! Okay.

{4043}{4094}- Have fun! Bye!|- That was so lame.
{4100}{4147}I know.

{4278}{4438}So you think that "Speed Racer" guy|gets a lot of tickets or...?
{4472}{4529}That's good.|So who broke up with who?
{4535}{4562}I broke up with her.
{4568}{4681}She actually thought Sean Penn|was the capital of Cambodia.
{4687}{4803}When everybody knows that|the capital of Cambodia is...
{4817}{4872}It's not Sean Penn.
{4878}{4909}I got a funny one.
{4915}{4999}My last girlfriend, Tilly.|We're eating breakfast, right?
{5005}{5061}I made these pancakes.|Like, 50 pancakes.
{5067}{5140}All of a sudden,|she turns to me and says, "Eddie...
{5146}{5192}...I don't wanna see you anymore."

{8279}{8347}Yeah, your name came up...
{8353}{8464}...in a conversation that|terrified me to my very soul.
{8470}{8502}He's kind of intense.
{8508}{8574}Yes! Hey, can I ask you,|is Eddie a little...

{10076}{10137}Well, kind of, yeah.
{10143}{10212}Remember last week|when Alex was in the accident?
{10218}{10260}The line in the script was...
{10266}{10349}..."If we don't get this woman|to a hospital, she's going to die."
{10355}{10426}But I made it, "If this woman|doesn't get to a hospital...

{10517}{10637}Oh, okay.|I see what you did there.

{13041}{13091}How is that possible? I mean...
{13097}{13184}...have you seen you?
{13198}{13230}I mean, what can I say?
{13236}{13336}I was married to Barbara for 30 years,|my high-school sweetheart.
{13342}{13399}Now you. That's two.
{13405}{13459}Two it is.
{13465}{13539}Time for bed.|I'm gonna brush my teeth.
{13545}{13584}No, wait a minute now!
{13590}{13631}Come on, it's your turn.
{13637}{13705}Oh, come on!
{13711}{13829}You know, I don't need the|actual number. Just a ballpark.
{13835}{13945}Okay, it is definitely|less than a ballpark.
{14024}{14081}I am so glad|I'm not Monica right now.
{14087}{14127}Tell me about it.
{14133}{14233}So what's your magic number?
{14262}{14374}Come on, you know everyone|I've been with. All both of them.
{14380}{14442}Well, there's you.
{14448}{14527}Better not be doing these in order.
{14548}{14630}Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.
{14636}{14689}Barry.
{14695}{14717}Paolo.
{14723}{14833}Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.
{14840}{14925}Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?
{14931}{15017}I'm so much happier with you|than I ever was with him.
{15023}{15072}- Really?|- Oh, please!
{15078}{15152}That Paolo thing was|barely a relationship.
{15158}{15281}All it really was|was just meaningless, animal sex.
{15342}{15479}Okay, you know, that sounded|so much better in my head.
{15485}{15537}I didn't sleep with|your ex-girlfriend.
{15543}{15622}That's exactly what someone|who slept with her would say.
{15628}{15702}This is nuts! Crazy!|She came over for two minutes...
{15708}{15762}...dropped off a fish tank and left!
{15768}{15796}Where's Buddy?
{15802}{15827}Buddy?
{15833}{15887}My fish, Buddy.
{15893}{15947}There was no fish|when she dropped it off.
{15953}{16004}This is unbelievable!
{16010}{16106}You sleep with my ex-girlfriend,|insult my intelligence by lying...
{16112}{16162}...then you kill my fish?|My Buddy?
{16168}{16207}I didn't kill your fish!
{16213}{16293}Look, Eddie...
{16338}{16397}Would you look at what I'm doing?
{16403}{16476}Now that can't be smart.
{16525}{16596}So we're just gonna|take this guy right off you...
{16602}{16698}...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.
{16711}{16780}Tangelo?
{16989}{17087}That's it? That's the giant number|you were afraid to tell me?
{17093}{17142}Well, that's not bad at all.
{17148}{17241}You had me thinking it was,|like, a fleet.
{17247}{17271}You're okay with it?
{17277}{17355}Oh, honey, I'm fine.
{17431}{17480}Okay, about that two.
{17486}{17511}What?
{17517}{17556}All right.
{17562}{17589}What about my two?
{17595}{17657}It just seems like|a really small number.
{17663}{17725}Right.
{17756}{17837}Don't you have a lot|of wild oats to sow?
{17843}{17962}Or is that what you're doing with me?|Oh, my God! Am I an oat?
{17968}{18009}Honey, you are not an oat.
{18015}{18105}I don't know, I guess|I'm just not an oat guy.
{18111}{18167}I've only slept with women I love.
{18173}{18252}You've only slept with two people.
{18335}{18395}Right.
{18551}{18616}You know I love you too, right?
{18622}{18698}Now I do.
{18802}{18864}Ross, please listen to me.
{18870}{18942}You are so much better for me|than Paolo ever was.
{18948}{19021}You care about me, you're loving,|you make me laugh.
{19027}{19086}If I make you laugh, here's an idea.
{19092}{19142}Invite Paolo to have|a romp in the sack...
{19148}{19258}...and I'll stand in the corner|and tell knock-knock jokes!
{19305}{19377}What we have is special!|All Paolo and I ever had was...
{19383}{19448}"Animal sex"?
{19492}{19532}So what are you saying?
{19538}{19607}There's nothing between us|"animal" at all?
{19613}{19707}There's not even,|like, a little animal?
{19713}{19754}Not even, like...
{19760}{19827}...chipmunk sex?
{19880}{19946}Try to hear me, okay?
{19952}{20011}I'm not gonna lie to you.
{20017}{20133}- It was good with Paolo.|- Knock-knock.
{20150}{20221}But what you and I have|is so much better.
{20227}{20330}We have tenderness,|we have intimacy, we connect.
{20336}{20371}You know? I swear.
{20377}{20427}This is the best...
{20433}{20534}...I have ever had.
{20536}{20594}Until now.
{20766}{20802}Richard told me he loved me.
{20808}{20834}- Oh, my God!|- I know!
{20840}{20871}Honey, that's great!
{20877}{20905}I know!
{20911}{20951}- I just can't find...|- Top drawer.
{20957}{21058}- Hurry.|- Why? You need one too?
{21080}{21150}Found them!
{21226}{21285}There's only one.
{21328}{21458}We'll be right there.|We're just trying to decide something.
{21855}{21973}- They're trying to decide something.|- Good. Good, good.
{22087}{22225}So was your mustache...|Did it used to be different?
{22358}{22468}How do you, you know,|keep it so neat?
{22478}{22536}I have a comb.
{22615}{22658}- What is that?|- A mustache comb.
{22664}{22723}Thank you.
{22729}{22858}Okay, I will do your laundry|for one month.
{22882}{22921}I will, I will, I will...
{22927}{22991}I will clean the apartment|for two months.
{22997}{23136}I'll give this to you now, if you|tell me where we keep the dustpan.
{23333}{23409}So were you in Nam?
{23483}{23544}- Rock, paper, scissors?|- Gotcha.
{23550}{23592}One, two, three.
{23598}{23662}Yes!
{23668}{23756}Fine. Go have sex.
{23778}{23834}No! You have got it completely wrong!
{23840}{23908}John Savage was "Deer Hunter",|no legs.
{23914}{23982}Jon Voight was "Coming Home",|couldn't feel his legs.
{23988}{24087}You've got it totally the other way|around, my friend. Jon Voight...
{24093}{24173}- Honey?|- What?
{24343}{24362}Shall we?
{24368}{24402}It's not gonna happen.
{24408}{24523}They're doing it tonight.|We can do it tomorrow.
{24558}{24673}In the future, if I could see|the schedule beforehand...
{24727}{24769}So when I woke up this morning...
{24775}{24856}...he'd stolen all the insoles|out of my shoes!
{24862}{24881}Why?
{24887}{24979}He thinks I slept with his|ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
{24985}{25065}Why would you kill his fish?
{25110}{25174}Because sometimes|after you sleep with someone...
{25180}{25273}...you have to kill a fish.
{25287}{25321}Chandler, honey...
{25327}{25353}...I'm sorry.
{25359}{25421}Can we watch Joey's show now, please?
{25427}{25463}Wait. He's not here yet.
{25469}{25543}He knows what happens.
{25553}{25648}I'm fine about my problem now,|by the way.
{25688}{25727}{y:i}Amber...
{25733}{25790}{y:i}... I'll always be there for you...
{25796}{25856}{y:i}... as a friend and as your brother.
{25862}{25910}{y:i}Oh, Drake.
{25916}{25947}{y:i}Hard day, huh?
{25953}{26017}First the medical award, now this?
{26023}{26102}Some guys are just lucky, I guess.
{26108}{26220}{y:i}Dr. Ramoray, report to|{y:i}first floor Emergency stat.
{26238}{26287}Well, then...
{26293}{26371}...I guess that's me.
{26393}{26500}Anyone else need to go on the elevator?|Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?
{26506}{26589}They only said you.
{26606}{26668}Oh, okay. All right.
{26674}{26702}I love you.
{26708}{26762}Yeah, whatever.
{26768}{26792}Oh, no!
{26798}{26867}Drake, look out!
{26941}{27033}- Did they just kill off Joey?|- No!
{27055}{27133}Now maybe.
{27133}{27205}Come on! Open up!|We want to talk to you!
{27211}{27245}I don't feel like talking!
{27251}{27296}Come on! We care about you.
{27302}{27438}- We're worried about you.|- And some of us really have to pee!
{27501}{27574}I'm sorry, Joey.
{27588}{27681}Listen, sorry about your death.|That really sucks.
{27687}{27766}- We came over as soon as we saw.|- How could you not tell us?
{27772}{27891}I don't know. I was kind of hoping|no one would ever find out.
{27897}{27989}Well, maybe they could find|a way to bring you back.
{27995}{28099}They said that when they found my body,|my brain was so smashed in...
{28105}{28228}...that the only doctor|who could've saved me was me.
{28233}{28325}It's supposed to be|some kind of irony.
{28335}{28375}But Joey, you're gonna be fine.
{28381}{28462}You don't need that show.|It was just a dumb soap opera.
{28468}{28543}This was the greatest thing|that ever happened to me.
{28549}{28642}Yes! I was going to incorporate that.
{28648}{28759}Here's Monica.|She'll have something nice to say.
{28760}{28871}I straightened out your shower curtain|so you won't get mildew.
{28877}{28946}What? To me, that's nice.
{28952}{29006}It'll be okay. You know that.
{29012}{29077}No, I don't.
{29083}{29162}It's like you work|your whole life for something...
{29168}{29219}...and you think|that when you get it...
{29225}{29280}...it'll never be|as good as you thought.
{29286}{29331}But this so was.
{29337}{29374}It changed everything.
{29380}{29457}Like, the other day,|I got this credit card application...
{29463}{29555}...and I was pre-approved!
{29579}{29659}I've never been pre-approved|for anything in my life!
{29665}{29701}I'm sorry, man.
{29707}{29785}I don't know if this'll mean|anything to you...
{29791}{29879}...but you'll always be|pre-approved with us.
{29885}{29962}That means nothing to me.
{30099}{30180}Pecan sandy? Just made them.
{30182}{30253}Yeah, all right.
{30259}{30308}Are these raisins?
{30314}{30371}Sure, why not?
{30512}{30581}Listen, Eddie.
{30582}{30664}I've been thinking about|our living situation.
{30670}{30697}Why are you smiling?
{30703}{30791}I got a little surprise.|Look. There's a new fishy.
{30797}{30828}I named him...
{30834}{30932}...Chandler, you know, after you.
{31115}{31206}Well, that's not even a real fish.
{31212}{31308}No, that's a Goldfish cracker.
{31316}{31393}So what's your point, man?
{31456}{31517}Okay, good night.
{31523}{31618}You big freak of nature!
{32243}{32315}- Brisk tonight.|- Oh, man.
{32321}{32418}- Let's never speak of this.|- You got it.

{151}{200}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{214}{278}Hey, Eddie.
{294}{386}- What are you doing here?|- Watching you sleep.
{399}{422}Why?
{428}{491}It makes me feel peaceful.
{497}{531}Please.
{537}{566}I can't sleep now!
{572}{638}You want me to sing?
{668}{747}That's it. I want you|out of the apartment now!
{753}{799}What are you talking about?
{805}{876}Hannibal Lecter?
{881}{932}Better roommate than you.
{938}{1030}I don't think you're being fair!|One night you see me and you get scared.
{1036}{1125}What about the other nights|when you don't see me?
{1131}{1178}Last night you went|and got some water...
{1184}{1270}...and I was nice enough|to hide behind the door.
{1276}{1350}I didn't realize that.
{1356}{1402}Get out now!
{1408}{1447}You really want me out?
{1453}{1476}Yes, please.
{1482}{1548}Then I want to hear you say|you want me out.
{1554}{1580}I want you out.
{1586}{1663}I want to hear it from your lips.
{1663}{1694}Where'd you hear it before?
{1700}{1774}All right. You know what?|Consider me gone.
{1780}{1895}I'll be out by the time|you get home from work tomorrow.
{1895}{1980}{y:i}- Thank you.|- I heard that.
{1990}{2065}The One Where Eddie Won't Go
{2071}{2133}English Subtitles by|GELULA & CO., INC.
{3271}{3314}Well, look at you!
{3320}{3395}Finally got that|time machine working, huh?
{3401}{3422}You like it?
{3428}{3495}This guy was selling them|on 8th Avenue and I thought...
{3501}{3525}..."You know what I don't have?"
{3531}{3590}A mirror?
{3596}{3691}Fine, make fun.|I think it's jaunty.
{3697}{3778}For a guy who's recently lost his job,|you're in a good mood.
{3784}{3860}I'll be all right.|I'm not starting from square one.
{3866}{3964}I was Dr. Drake Ramoray|on "Days of our Lives".
{3970}{4045}That's got to have some kind of cachet.
{4051}{4097}Cachet? Jaunty?
{4103}{4204}Chandler gave me|word-of-the-day toilet paper.
{4216}{4289}I'm gonna get some coffee.
{4328}{4372}So? Did you read the book?
{4378}{4429}Oh, my God.|It was incredible!
{4435}{4489}Didn't it, like,|totally speak to you?
{4495}{4520}What book is this?
{4526}{4632}You have to read this book.|It's called "Be Your Own Wind Keeper".
{4638}{4690}It's about how women need|to become more empowered.
{4696}{4793}But there's wind.
{4797}{4862}And the wind can make us goddesses.
{4868}{4994}Do you know who takes our wind?|Men. They just take it.
{4999}{5051}Men just take our wind?
{5057}{5179}All the time. Because they|are the lightning-bearers.
{5218}{5298}That sounds kind of cool.|It's like "The Hobbit".
{5304}{5367}It is nothing like "The Hobbit".
{5373}{5435}It's like reading about|every relationship I've ever had.
{5441}{5468}Except for Richard.
{5474}{5558}Richard would never steal your wind.
{5564}{5623}Because he's yummy.
{5629}{5653}But all the others.
{5659}{5727}And the part about how|they're always drinking...
{5733}{5778}...from our pool of inner power.
{5784}{5837}But God forbid we should take a sip.
{5843}{5893}Anybody want a cruller?
{5899}{5959}This is a typical|lightning-bearer thing.
{5965}{5999}It's like...
{6005}{6130}..."Hello. Who wants one of|my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"
{6277}{6387}Don't worry about it, already!|Things happen.
{6404}{6494}You're not mad at me|for getting fired and everything?
{6500}{6538}Look at me.
{6544}{6616}Look at me!
{6624}{6719}Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
{6783}{6811}Can we get back to me?
{6817}{6918}Look, honey. People get fired|left and right in this business.
{6924}{6997}I already got you an audition|for "Another World".
{7003}{7050}All right!
{7056}{7101}"Cab Driver Number 2"?
{7107}{7177}You're welcome.
{7193}{7243}But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
{7249}{7332}How can I go from being|a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?
{7338}{7417}Things change. Roll with them.
{7423}{7475}But this is a two-line part!
{7481}{7531}It's like taking a step backwards.
{7537}{7619}I'm not gonna do this.
{7659}{7730}I'm gonna tell you the same thing|I told Al Minza...
{7736}{7814}...and his pyramid of dogs.
{7820}{7939}Take any job you can get,|and don't make on the floor.
{7948}{7996}I'm sorry.
{8002}{8068}I'll see you.
{8092}{8124}God!
{8130}{8180}Oh, God!|I mean, it's just so...
{8186}{8230}Isn't it?
{8236}{8295}This is like reading|about my own life!
{8301}{8408}This book could have been called|"Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel"!
{8414}{8459}It wouldn't have sold|a million copies...
{8465}{8554}...but it would've made|a nice gift for you.
{8581}{8669}Sweetie, we've got to go.
{8743}{8858}No! Why do we always have to do|everything according to your timetable?
{8864}{8955}Actually, it's the movie theater|that has the timetable.
{8961}{9037}It's so you don't miss the beginning.
{9043}{9198}This isn't about the movie theater.|This is about you stealing my wind.
{9211}{9286}You go, girl!
{9319}{9409}I can't pull that off, can I?
{9415}{9485}Excuse me, your wind?
{9491}{9526}Yes, my wind.
{9532}{9654}How do you expect me to grow|if you won't let me blow?
{9773}{9859}You know I don't...
{9884}{9974}...have a problem with that.
{10198}{10316}I just really need to be|with myself right now.
{10322}{10366}I'm sorry.
{10372}{10456}You're right.|I don't have to apologize.
{10462}{10537}Sorry. Damn it!
{10660}{10698}- What is it?|- I don't know.
{10704}{10769}It's got all this stuff|about wind and trees...
{10775}{10813}...and some sacred pool.
{10819}{10895}I don't really get it.|But she's pretty upset about it.
{10901}{11005}This is why I don't date|women who read.
{11039}{11085}What's that?
{11091}{11127}It's my VIS A bill.
{11133}{11224}Envelope one of two.
{11238}{11341}- That can't be good.|- Open it, open it.
{11382}{11429}Oh, my God!
{11435}{11516}Look at this!|How did I spend so much money?
{11522}{11626}That's just the minimum amount.|That's your total.
{11651}{11747}Thirty-five hundred dollars|at "Porcelain Safari"?
{11753}{11809}My animals.
{11815}{11936}The guy said they suited me. He spoke|with an accent. I was confused.
{11942}{11974}I don't know what to do!
{11980}{12050}You can start by driving a cab|on "Another World".
{12056}{12097}- What?|- That audition?
{12103}{12145}That's a two-line part!
{12151}{12250}Joey, you owe $ 1100|at "I Love Lucite".
{12256}{12307}- So what?|- So suck it up, man.
{12313}{12353}It's a job. It's money.
{12359}{12470}I don't need you getting judgmental|and condescending and pedantic.
{12476}{12545}Toilet paper?
{12581}{12649}I'm not being any of those things.|I'm being realistic.
{12655}{12698}You're supposed to be my friend!
{12704}{12724}I am your friend.
{12730}{12779}Then tell me things like,|"You'll be fine."
{12785}{12859}And "Something big's gonna|come along. I know it!"
{12865}{12896}But I don't know it.
{12902}{13023}What I do know is you owe $ 2300|at "Isn't It Chromantic?"
{13023}{13065}I'm aware of what I owe.
{13071}{13162}Then get some sense.|It took you 10 years to get that job.
{13168}{13235}- How long till you get another?|- I don't want to hear this!
{13241}{13266}I'm just saying...
{13272}{13360}Well, don't "just say"!
{13381}{13452}Maybe I should just go.
{13488}{13552}I'll see you later.
{13558}{13595}Just think about it.
{13601}{13645}I don't need to think about it!
{13651}{13704}I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
{13710}{13754}That was huge!
{13760}{13817}Big things are gonna happen!|You'll see!
{13823}{13856}Ross!
{13862}{13935}You still there?
{14270}{14301}What are you still doing here?
{14307}{14375}Just some basic dehydrating|of fruits and vegetables.
{14381}{14469}Man alive, this thing's fantastic!
{14475}{14518}Aren't you forgetting anything?
{14524}{14575}Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.
{14581}{14625}He's feistier than the last one.
{14631}{14739}Maybe because the last one|was made by Pepperidge Farm.
{14739}{14827}Eddie, isn't there something|you're supposed to be doing now?
{14833}{14890}Not unless it's got something|to do with dehydrating.
{14896}{15001}Because right now,|I'm a dehydrating maniac!
{15034}{15112}I thought we had a deal.|I thought by the time I got...
{15118}{15158}You know what that is?
{15164}{15234}Your last roommate's kidney?
{15240}{15282}That's a tomato.
{15288}{15399}This one definitely goes|in the display.
{15573}{15647}Hey, Gunther.|Let me get a lemonade to go.
{15653}{15681}Lemonade?
{15687}{15739}You okay, man?
{15745}{15782}It's career stuff.
{15788}{15855}They killed off|my character on the show.
{15861}{15922}That's too bad.|How'd they do it?
{15928}{15997}I fell down an elevator shaft.
{16003}{16029}That sucks.
{16035}{16111}I was buried in an avalanche.
{16117}{16138}What?
{16144}{16240}I used to be Brice|on "All My Children".
{16732}{16779}Why must everybody watch me sleep?
{16785}{16837}There'll be no more|watching me sleep! No more...
{16843}{16905}...watching!
{17034}{17114}I got some great stuff to dehydrate.|Grapes, apricots.
{17120}{17212}I thought it'd be cool to see|what happens with these water balloons.
{17218}{17324}Get out.|Get out, get out, get out!
{17329}{17368}- What?|- You! Move out!
{17374}{17470}Take your fruit!|Your stupid small fruit and get out!
{17476}{17559}You want me to move out?
{17728}{17868}I gotta tell you, that's kind of|out of the blue, don't you think?
{17868}{17903}This is not out of the blue!
{17909}{17997}This is smack-dab|in the middle of the blue!
{18021}{18068}Relax! Take it easy, buddy!
{18074}{18149}You don't have to tell me twice.
{18158}{18240}Someone will be by for my stuff.
{18323}{18430}If you think I'm leaving you|alone with my fish, you're insane!
{18436}{18460}You want some help?
{18466}{18549}No help required, "chico"!
{18718}{18798}All the way to the airport, huh?|You know, that's over 30 miles.
{18804}{18882}That's gonna cost you about so bucks.
{18888}{18979}Excuse me, that's fifty bucks.
{18988}{19061}Five-O dollars.
{19067}{19158}You know what it is?|It's smudgy because they're fax pages.
{19164}{19253}When I was on "Days of our Lives"|as Dr. Drake Ramoray...
{19259}{19341}...they'd send over|the whole script on real paper.
{19347}{19390}That's great.
{19396}{19492}If you wanted to expand this scene,|like have the cab crash...
{19498}{19542}...I could attend to the victims...
{19548}{19629}...because I have a background|in medical acting.
{19635}{19696}Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.
{19702}{19817}Don't thank me for coming in.|At least let me finish.
{19883}{19936}We could take the expressway...
{19942}{20057}...but this time of day|you're better off taking the budge.
{20092}{20179}You were going for bridge there,|weren't you?
{20185}{20264}I'll have a good day.
{20349}{20379}Question number 28.
{20385}{20492}"Have you ever allowed|a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"
{20498}{20576}I would have to say no.
{20598}{20663}And I would have to say...
{20669}{20690}What?
{20696}{20736}Do you not remember the puppet guy?
{20742}{20892}You totally let him wash his feet|in the pool of your inner power.
{20898}{20940}And his puppet too!
{20946}{20997}Well, at least|I didn't let some guy...
{21003}{21109}...into the forest of my righteous|truth on the first date!
{21177}{21246}- Who?|- Paul!
{21272}{21328}Moving on, moving on.|Next question.
{21334}{21369}Okay, number 29.
{21375}{21445}"Have you ever betrayed|another goddess...
{21451}{21520}...for a lightning-bearer?"|Okay, number 30.
{21526}{21632}Whoa, whoa, whoa!|Let's go back to 29.
{21694}{21774}Not to my recollection.
{21780}{21829}Danny Arshack, ninth grade.
{21835}{21894}You know the bottle|was pointing at me.
{21900}{22003}Only because you took up|half the circle!
{22058}{22151}Listen to you two.|It's so sad.
{22157}{22265}Looks like I'll be going to|the goddess meetings alone.
{22267}{22322}Not when they find out|you slept with Jason Hurley...
{22328}{22432}...an hour after|he broke up with Monica.
{22434}{22465}One hour?
{22471}{22560}You are such a leaf blower!
{22894}{23039}Be careful with that 3-D "Last Supper".|Judas is a little loose.
{23119}{23182}Oh, my God! What's going on?
{23188}{23270}They're taking all my stuff back.|I guess you were right.
{23276}{23372}No, I wasn't right.|That's what I came here to tell you.
{23378}{23462}I was totally hung up|on my own stuff the other day.
{23468}{23558}No, listen. I need the whole|security thing, you know?
{23564}{23670}To know where my next paycheck is|coming from. But you don't need that.
{23676}{23713}And that's amazing to me.
{23719}{23792}I could never do what you do.
{23798}{23861}- Thanks.|- You hold out for something bigger.
{23867}{23917}I can't tell you|how much respect I have...
{23923}{23990}...for you not going|to that stupid audition.
{23996}{24047}- I went.|- Great! How did it go?
{24053}{24097}- I didn't get it.|- Good for you!
{24103}{24169}You're living the dream!
{24176}{24242}All right, then!
{24248}{24309}Not my parrot.
{24315}{24387}I can't watch this.
{24393}{24446}Hey, hold on, hold on.
{24452}{24542}How much for the...|How much to save the bird?
{24548}{24589}- Twelve hundred.|- Dollars?
{24595}{24663}You spent $ 1200 on a plastic bird?
{24669}{24737}It was an impulse buy.|Near the register.
{24743}{24800}Go ahead with the bird.
{24806}{24921}Do you have anything for around $ 200?
{24922}{24990}The dog.
{25055}{25083}I'll take it.
{25089}{25166}My gift to you, man.
{25188}{25216}Thanks, Ross!
{25222}{25280}I really liked that bird, though.
{25286}{25364}But the dog!
{25553}{25585}Here are your cakes.
{25591}{25630}We didn't order cake.
{25636}{25716}No, I know. They're from me.
{25722}{25761}You guys, this is not good.
{25767}{25826}We have enough trouble|with guys stealing our wind...
{25832}{25894}...without taking it from each other.
{25900}{25947}You're right.
{25953}{26027}I love you goddesses.
{26057}{26136}I don't ever want|to suck your wind again.
{26142}{26200}- Thank you. So are we good?|- We're good.
{26206}{26246}We're good?
{26252}{26358}Let me take these back.|They'll take it out of my paycheck.
{26398}{26484}Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!
{26558}{26596}Are you sure this time?
{26602}{26648}I actually saw him leave.
{26654}{26717}That guy is holding a human head.
{26723}{26815}He's holding a human head!
{26838}{26863}Check it out, man!
{26869}{26940}I tore it off a mannequin|in the alley behind Macy's.
{26946}{26972}There's no alley behind Macy's.
{26978}{27044}So I got it in the junior miss|department. Big diff.
{27050}{27137}It'll make a hell of a conversation|piece at our next cocktail party.
{27143}{27220}"Our next cocktail party"?
{27226}{27331}We'll put chips in it.|We'll make it a chip chick.
{27372}{27421}Do you remember yesterday?
{27427}{27515}Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
{27600}{27712}Do you remember|talking to me yesterday?
{27833}{27860}So what happened?
{27866}{27912}We took a road trip to Las Vegas!
{27918}{28001}Oh, sweet Moses!
{28002}{28064}So on this road trip,|did you win any money?
{28070}{28146}I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!|He cleans up!
{28152}{28214}$300! He buys me these new shoes.
{28220}{28247}Nice.
{28253}{28339}See you upstairs. See you, pals!
{28397}{28510}Is anyone else starting|to really like him?
{28946}{29005}May I help you?
{29010}{29084}Why doesn't my key work,|and what's my stuff doing downstairs?
{29090}{29163}I'm sorry.
{29164}{29195}Have we met?
{29201}{29274}It's Eddie, you freak!|Your roommate.
{29280}{29329}I'm sorry...
{29335}{29426}...I already have a roommate.
{29559}{29703}He's lived here for years.|I don't know what you're talking about.
{29731}{29845}No, he moved out and I moved in.
{29851}{29933}Well, I think we'd remember|something like that.
{29939}{30006}I know I would.
{30012}{30068}That's a good point.
{30074}{30099}Okay, wow.
{30105}{30196}I guess I got the wrong apartment.
{30234}{30290}- I'm terribly sorry.|- Hey, no problem.
{30296}{30361}See you.
{30476}{30590}Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.
{30596}{30688}- You want me to help you unpack?|- Nah, I'm okay.
{30694}{30781}Just so you know, I'm not|moving back in because I have to.
{30787}{30852}I mean, I do have to, but...
{30858}{30933}It's just that that place,|it wasn't really...
{30939}{31008}I mean, this is...
{31014}{31088}Welcome home, man.
{31278}{31374}- A little foos?|- Absolutely!
{31400}{31454}What happened to the foosball?
{31460}{31531}It's a cantaloupe.
{31631}{31699}Are we gonna bring this out|every time Ross comes over?
{31705}{31794}He paid a lot of money for it.
{31904}{31983}I'm gonna hold him a different way.
{31989}{32074}If you hated it so much,|why'd you buy it in the first place?
{32080}{32170}Well, I had a whole ceramic|zoo thing going over there.
{32176}{32253}But without the other ones,|it looks tacky.
{32259}{32362}Is he housetrained or will he leave|little bathroom tiles all over?
{32368}{32429}Stay.
{32436}{32466}Stay!
{32472}{32554}Good fake dog.

{640}{681}Pheebs, what about the end?
{687}{763}When Yeller saves the family|and everyone's happy?
{769}{794}That's not the end.
{800}{931}That's when my mother would|shut off the TV and say, "The end".
{932}{979}What about when he has rabies?
{985}{1075}He doesn't have rabies.|He has babies.
{1090}{1151}That's what my mom said.
{1157}{1256}I don't think she'd want you|to see what's about to happen.
{1262}{1303}Why? What's about to happen?
{1309}{1354}I've never seen this part.
{1360}{1466}Hey, Travis, what you doing|with that gun?

{3317}{3404}Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
{3511}{3616}One of these times, you'll really|be naked and we won't come over.
{3622}{3671}I got a leg, three breasts|and a wing.
{3677}{3766}How do you find clothes that fit?
{3770}{3820}Hey, Monica? We got a question.
{3826}{3906}All right, yes, I see other women|in the shower at the gym.
{3912}{3962}And no, I don't look.
{3968}{3999}No, not that one.
{4005}{4074}We're figuring out who to bring|to the Nicks game.
{4080}{4198}Ross can't go, so it's between my friend|Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

{4288}{4387}"You want more beer?|Is that Spike Lee?"
{4428}{4489}Why don't you ask Richard?
{4495}{4610}Richard, if you had an extra|ticket to the Nicks game...

{4721}{4847}...and one who bruises you,|who would you pick?
{4849}{4893}Being a huge Nicks fan myself...
{4899}{5031}...I think you should take someone|who's a huge Nicks fan.
{5045}{5106}That's Eric.
{5112}{5194}Glad to be of help.|Matches.
{5200}{5289}I meant, why don't you|take Richard to the game?
{5295}{5352}What?
{5358}{5406}- I don't know.|- Come on!
{5412}{5518}He keeps his fingers to himself,|and he's always minty fresh.
{5524}{5607}Richard's really nice.|We just don't know him really well.
{5613}{5691}Plus, he's old...
{5710}{5774}- er than some people.
{5780}{5879}But younger than some buildings.
{5897}{5953}So what, he's a little older.|Big deal.
{5959}{5994}He's important to me.
{6000}{6108}If you ask him,|he might take you in his Jag.
{6185}{6214}How do we say yes...
{6220}{6328}...and make it seem like it's not|just to ride in the cool car?
{6334}{6420}Okay, this could be tough.
{6449}{6570}We'll bring him,|but only if he takes the Jaguar.
{6592}{6675}You almost had it.
{6792}{6880}No, no, you're fine. You're fine.
{6899}{6938}Hi, honey.
{6944}{7002}You are not gonna believe|what happened!

{7173}{7222}He pulled himself up!
{7228}{7287}Standing man!
{7293}{7397}I'm sorry you missed it,|but I did tape it if you wanna see it.
{7403}{7456}We know. He already did it last week.
{7462}{7510}You can watch our tape if you want.
{7516}{7622}See, I don't believe this.|I missed the first time of everything.
{7628}{7704}The first time he rolled over,|the first time he crawled.
{7710}{7765}What else? Has he spoken?|Is he driving?
{7771}{7830}Does he have a favorite liqueur?
{7836}{7898}He is getting closer|on the talking thing.
{7904}{7981}He can't quite say "mama" yet,|but once he said "Yemen".
{7987}{8079}See, I don't know.|I'm so sick of missing stuff.
{8085}{8169}I want him for more than a day.|I want him for a whole weekend.
{8175}{8198}Listen. I feel...

{9355}{9453}You know, before she killed herself.
{9508}{9569}Where's Richard?|Did you ditch him?
{9575}{9676}After we stole his lunch money|and gave him a wedgie.

{11415}{11495}Have a good time.
{11548}{11606}Look.
{11740}{11839}Joey, do you know|we can see you from here?
{11840}{11900}How come Richard looks cooler|with one of these?
{11906}{12013}You may wanna light it|and lose the spatula.
{12030}{12089}It's cute, you trying|to be more like Richard.
{12095}{12138}Not like him, per se.
{12144}{12232}Just not unlike him.
{12448}{12538}It's the artist formerly known|as Chandler.
{12539}{12605}I'm just trying something here,|you know?
{12611}{12653}Why didn't you grow a mustache?
{12659}{12686}We flipped for it.
{12692}{12766}I got the cigar,|he got the mustache.
{12772}{12849}If we both grew them,|we'd look like dorks.
{12855}{12928}You really sidestepped|that land mine.
{12934}{12996}I promised Richard|we'd meet him downstairs.
{13002}{13026}You're meeting Richard?
{13032}{13074}- Ranger game.|- Didn't he tell you?
{13080}{13158}He said he was going out with the guys.|I didn't know that was you.
{13164}{13191}You hear that?
{13197}{13268}We're the guys!
{13274}{13333}With that mustache,|he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.
{13339}{13406}Thank you!
{13586}{13644}Hi. We're visiting.
{13650}{13760}It's Ben and his dada.
{13791}{13846}Can you say "dada"?
{13852}{13926}I'm telling your mommies you said it,|so you might as well.
{13932}{13966}No luck, huh?
{13972}{14029}A while ago,|I got a "seh" out of him...
{14035}{14189}...which I thought might turn into|"seh-condary caregiver", but...
{14223}{14312}Would you hold him for a sec?|I gotta take this off.
{14318}{14400}Sure. Okay.
{14502}{14530}What are you doing?
{14536}{14620}I'm holding Ben.
{14638}{14714}He's a baby, not a bomb.
{14730}{14782}Hold him like you'd hold a football.
{14788}{14844}This is how I would hold a football.
{14850}{14903}Here. Here. There we go.
{14909}{15012}Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.|I haven't been around them.
{15018}{15068}I mean, you know, since I was one.
{15074}{15139}- It's all right. No big deal.|- Really?
{15145}{15214}I'm sure you'll feel different|when it's our baby.
{15220}{15276}- What?|- What?
{15282}{15342}You think about stuff like that?
{15348}{15416}Yeah. I mean...
{15422}{15537}Actually, I kind of think|that we'll have two babies.
{15543}{15596}Two babies?
{15602}{15651}You know, a boy and a girl.
{15657}{15774}Hopefully, the girl will come first,|so Ben won't feel competitive.
{15805}{15846}Then what's gonna happen?
{15852}{15986}We won't wanna raise kids in the city,|so we'll move to Scarsdale.
{15997}{16078}We'll be far enough from our parents|so we don't have to see them...
{16084}{16140}...but close enough|that they can baby-sit.
{16146}{16247}And yes, I know the taxes are|a little higher than Nassau County...
{16253}{16338}...but the school system's great.
{16380}{16447}Wow, that's great! Great!
{16453}{16501}Okay, wow! You know what?
{16507}{16578}I'm off my break now.
{16584}{16659}Here. You take this.
{16682}{16782}I'm gonna go pour these|very nice people some coffee.
{16788}{16835}Look at that. I don't have a pot.
{16841}{16899}I don't have a pot.|Maybe I've got one at home.
{16905}{16997}Or in Scarsdale.|Hey, is that a door?
{17140}{17181}Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?
{17187}{17311}Murder, cancer, soccer teams eating|each other in the Andes.
{17321}{17363}So you watched the movies?
{17369}{17434}What is happening to the world?
{17440}{17509}I mean...|No, no, because E.T. Leaves...
{17515}{17581}...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.
{17587}{17619}Charlotte who?
{17625}{17658}With the web. The spider.
{17664}{17712}She dies. She has babies and dies.
{17718}{17829}It's like, "Welcome home|from the hospital." Thud!
{17833}{17911}You wanna feel better?
{17938}{17998}Here. Watch this.
{18004}{18066}{y:i}It's a Wonderful Life.|I've heard of this.
{18072}{18133}So you can't lose.|It's there in the title.
{18139}{18179}Wonderfulness is baked right in.
{18185}{18244}I fell for that with|{y:i}Pride of the Yankees.
{18250}{18297}I thought I'd see a film|about Yankee pride.
{18303}{18410}And boom! The guy gets|Lou Gehrig's disease.
{18420}{18559}The guy was Lou Gehrig.|Didn't you kind of see it coming?
{18570}{18659}Watch that. It'll restore|all your faith in humanity.
{18665}{18703}Hey, big guy. Game time.
{18709}{18775}- Hey! Be right there!|- There's a game?
{18781}{18879}I just got my Pik-Up Stiks|back from the shop.
{18885}{18970}Bring your nerves of steel.
{18990}{19036}It's the basketball playoffs.
{19042}{19148}I appreciate this, but you don't|have to hang out with them for me.
{19154}{19188}They have each other.
{19194}{19246}Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.
{19252}{19345}I like hanging out with them.|They're different than my other friends.
{19351}{19473}They don't start sentences with|"You know who just died shoveling snow?"
{19479}{19544}All right, that's great.|Then just go.
{19550}{19584}Go Nicks!
{19590}{19630}It's the college playoffs.
{19636}{19693}- Then, go Vassar!|- They're not in it.
{19699}{19780}Okay, then just go.
{19800}{19844}Why does this bother me so much?
{19850}{19961}I'm not one of those people who wants|to spend 24 hours a day together.
{19967}{19995}Sure.
{20001}{20075}He just doesn't have much free time.|What do I do?
{20081}{20213}Does it matter? You'll just die|or divorce or blow your pet's head off.
{20275}{20296}Me too!
{20302}{20383}Rachel, I got a question. Richard|made plans again with the guys...
{20389}{20438}Ross made plans for the century.
{20444}{20538}I'm gonna go read "Cosmo".|Maybe there's something helpful in it.
{20544}{20695}If not, I can learn how to do a bikini|wax with leftover Christmas candles.
{20731}{20776}What happened back there?
{20782}{20823}I don't know. You tell me.
{20829}{20894}One minute I'm holding Ben,|then I've got two kids...
{20900}{20971}...I'm living in Scarsdale|complaining about taxes!
{20977}{21039}Well, I'm sorry.|I think about stuff.
{21045}{21131}You're at work, you're assembling bones,|your mind wanders.
{21137}{21224}You've planned out the next 20 years.|We've dated for six weeks!
{21230}{21277}You never think about our future?
{21283}{21356}I think about whose apartment|we'll sleep at tomorrow...
{21362}{21409}...and where we'll have dinner|next Saturday!
{21415}{21502}I do not think about|our children's names!
{21508}{21591}You know what our|children's names will be?
{21597}{21702}No, I mean, you know. I read a book,|and there was a girl named Emily.
{21708}{21798}And I thought that might be good.
{21808}{21854}What book?
{21860}{21942}{y:i}The Big Book of Children's Names.
{21969}{21996}Okay, listen.
{22002}{22036}What we have is amazing.
{22042}{22108}But I do not want|everything decided for me!
{22114}{22153}I spent my whole life like that.
{22159}{22219}It's what I had with Barry.|That's a reason I left.
{22225}{22274}I like not knowing right now.
{22280}{22373}Sorry if that scares you, but if you|wanna be with me, deal with that!
{22379}{22419}- Okay, fine!|- Thank you!
{22425}{22489}- We're not done!|- I didn't know that.
{22495}{22591}You're with a guy who won't stop|planning his future with you.
{22597}{22641}He knows we'll end up together.
{22647}{22720}If that scares you, tough!|You'll have to deal with that.
{22726}{22773}- I will!|- Good, because I love you!
{22779}{22815}Oh, yeah? I love you too!
{22821}{22873}- That's the first time we've said that!|- Yes, it is!
{22879}{22976}- I'm gonna kiss you!|- You better!
{23129}{23165}Thanks for the great movie tip.
{23171}{23215}- Did you like it?|- Oh, yeah.
{23221}{23305}I don't know if I was happier when|George Bailey destroyed the business...
{23311}{23442}...or Donna Reed cried or when|the pharmacist made his ear bleed.
{23450}{23521}I'll give you the ear thing,|but wasn't the ending wonderful?
{23527}{23574}I didn't watch it.|I was too depressed.
{23580}{23634}It kept getting worse!|It should've been called:
{23640}{23780}"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You|Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"
{23809}{23843}Kick, save! And...
{23849}{23891}...denied!
{23897}{23992}He gets it back.|Pass to the middle, lines it up...
{23998}{24018}Yes!
{24024}{24109}Could that shot be any prettier?
{24115}{24151}Man, you are incredible.
{24157}{24198}We had a table in college.
{24204}{24294}Really? I didn't know they had|foosball in the 1800s.
{24300}{24435}Nice mustache. At puberty,|that thing will really kick in.
{24497}{24584}Not to sound too Florence Henderson,|but dinner's on the table.
{24590}{24652}One more point.
{24690}{24755}Score!
{24755}{24801}Now can we go?
{24807}{24895}That's why we don't let her play.
{24915}{24990}Is everything all right?
{25018}{25068}Don't be mad at him.|It's our fault.
{25074}{25121}I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.
{25127}{25176}He's just really great|to hang out with.
{25182}{25209}- Well...|- No, seriously.
{25215}{25338}We just talked about this.|He is so much cooler than our dads.
{25372}{25438}Our dads are okay and all,|but Richard is just...
{25444}{25521}What are you kicking me for?
{25525}{25617}I'm trying to talk here.
{25637}{25683}You guys see me as a dad?
{25689}{25771}- Oh, yeah!|- No!
{25825}{25924}You're just clearly not familiar|with our young persons' vernacular.
{25930}{26024}When we say "dad", we mean "buddy".
{26030}{26070}We mean "pal".
{26076}{26180}No, seriously. Joey's my dad.
{26209}{26256}Monica's my dad.
{26262}{26339}I've even got some dads down at work.
{26345}{26368}That's fine.
{26374}{26474}Well, your other dad and I are gonna|go have a romantic evening.
{26480}{26529}I'll just see you kids around.
{26535}{26565}Nighty-night.
{26571}{26638}You're not a dad!
{26644}{26735}I can't believe you got us|into trouble.
{26843}{26917}So are you okay?
{26929}{26953}Just...
{26959}{27027}...I feel like I'm about a hundred.
{27033}{27106}I thought I was just one of the guys.
{27112}{27141}Come here.
{27147}{27246}I'll make you feel like|one of the guys.
{27353}{27443}For a really cool guy,|you suck at foosball.
{27449}{27493}I was killing them.
{27499}{27590}Yeah, well they suck too.
{27631}{27715}You take the poopy diaper|and put it in the poopy diaper pail.
{27721}{27856}Calling it a "poopy diaper"|doesn't make this process any cuter.
{27920}{27962}{y:i}- It's us.|- Come on up.
{27968}{28008}I'll get his stuff together.
{28014}{28092}Okay, we can do this now,|can't we, Ben?
{28098}{28132}Yes, we can.
{28138}{28205}Yes, we can.
{28206}{28287}There! I did it!
{28293}{28341}I did it!
{28347}{28397}Look at that!
{28403}{28490}It stays on and everything.
{28623}{28708}I'm sorry. What did you just say?|Did you just say "hi"?
{28714}{28781}Oh, my God! Ross?|Ben just said hi!
{28787}{28819}- What?|- Ben just said hi!
{28825}{28858}What, the word "hi"?
{28864}{28929}No, my Uncle Hi.
{28935}{29003}Great! And I missed that too.|I miss everything!
{29009}{29124}Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just|bring it out in him.
{29130}{29174}- Where is he?|- We missed you.
{29180}{29263}We missed you so much!|Come here, Ben.
{29269}{29343}Guess what?|Ben just said his first word.
{29349}{29375}What did he say?
{29381}{29442}Something about hi.
{29448}{29572}That's so exciting!|Mommy's so proud of you!
{29589}{29677}You know, actually,|it's more like, hi!
{29775}{29815}This could go on for a while.
{29821}{29868}You're right.|We've got a cab waiting.
{29874}{29915}Well, this was fun.
{29921}{30023}We should do it again sometime, Ben.|What do you say?
{30029}{30096}- All right, so I've got him...?|- Tuesday.
{30102}{30121}Bye, you guys.
{30127}{30212}- Take care.|- Bye, Ben.
{30269}{30320}Did he just say "bye"?
{30326}{30354}He said bye!
{30360}{30407}You said bye!|He said bye to me!
{30413}{30459}Yes, he did!
{30465}{30548}Suddenly I'm seeing him|go off to college!
{30554}{30640}We've gotta go.|We've got that cab downstairs.
{30646}{30713}See you later.
{31111}{31184}{y:i}Look at this nice deep hole I dug.|{y:i}Hey, Bert...
{31190}{31259}{y:i}... isn't this a nice hole here?
{31265}{31381}Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries|Bert in the sand and can't find him.
{31387}{31531}Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,|and he does find him again.
{31537}{31623}But before that happens,|there's some rough going for a while.
{31629}{31679}But I think we can handle it.
{31685}{31811}And there's just the alphabet,|but we know that ends well, so...
{31817}{31844}Here we go.
{31850}{31925}{y:i}Bert? Bert?
{31932}{32015}{y:i}What happened to my friend Bert?|{y:i}He was here just a moment ago.
{32021}{32074}{y:i}Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.
{32080}{32165}I'm so glad you're here.
{32181}{32259}Bye-bye, baby.

{67}{143}Chandler, Mon, there's only one|banana-nut muffin left.
{149}{176}I ordered mine first.
{182}{268}Yeah, but I'm so much faster.
{270}{294}Give it to me.
{300}{329}No.
{335}{378}Give it to me!
{384}{462}Okay, you can have it.
{616}{694}There you go. Enjoy your coffee.
{700}{792}That was there when I got here.
{820}{906}Hey, you'll never guess|who's coming to New York.
{912}{966}Quick, tell us before he swallows.
{972}{1054}Ryan, that guy I dated|who's in the Navy.
{1060}{1111}You went out with a guy in the Navy?
{1117}{1175}I met him while playing guitar|in the park.
{1181}{1260}Ryan threw in saltwater taffy|because he didn't have change.
{1266}{1377}Is that when you wrote|{y:i}Saltwater Taffy Man?
{1385}{1475}No, he's my submarine guy.|He resurfaces every couple years...
{1481}{1544}...and we have an amazing|three days together.
{1550}{1700}Only this time, he's coming for 2 weeks.|Two whole weeks, which means "yea"!
{1704}{1815}So this guy goes down|for, like, two years at a time?
{1864}{1952}That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
{2025}{2072}Hi.
{2078}{2106}Oh, no. What happened?
{2112}{2170}I just spoke to Carol.|Ben's got chickenpox.
{2176}{2199}Oh, no.
{2205}{2285}Yeah, so if you haven't had it,|chances are you'll get it.
{2291}{2330}- I've had it.|- I've had it.
{2336}{2358}- Had it.|- Had it.
{2364}{2481}I've never had it. I feel so left out.|Oh, look!

{3761}{3825}Honey, you made the bed again.
{3831}{3908}I told you, you don't have to do that.|This isn't camp.
{3914}{4049}Then I guess the panty raid last night|was totally uncalled for.
{4051}{4197}I'm taking a shower. Today I'll|sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown".
{4451}{4511}Hey, Mon, I have a question.
{4517}{4586}Is Leroy the baddest man|in the whole damn town...
{4592}{4656}...or the fattest man?
{4662}{4776}The baddest. Otherwise, the song|would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown".
{4782}{4841}What are you doing?
{4851}{4957}I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.
{4979}{5043}Are you remaking the bed?
{5049}{5125}I'm sorry. The way you did it,|it was just fine.
{5131}{5188}Then you're redoing it|because...?
{5194}{5232}You'll think I'm crazy.
{5238}{5342}You're pretty much|running that risk either way.
{5350}{5404}Okay. You see...
{5410}{5480}...the duvet tag shouldn't be|at the top left corner...
{5486}{5565}...it should be at the|bottom right corner.
{5571}{5646}- That's not so crazy.|- I'm just easing you in.
{5652}{5686}All right.
{5692}{5742}You see these little flower blossoms?
{5748}{5796}They should be facing up not down...
{5802}{5927}...because the head of the bed|is where the sun would be.
{5982}{6064}You don't love me anymore, do you?
{6082}{6166}Actually, if it's possible,|I love you more.
{6172}{6229}Really?
{6242}{6291}Wow. Well, then, come on!
{6297}{6412}I wanna show you how to fold|the toilet paper into a point.

{6532}{6601}...I can get you a job here|as an entry-level processor.
{6607}{6651}Don't you need experience?
{6657}{6689}It's not hard to learn.
{6695}{6784}As for people realizing you don't know|what you're doing, you're an actor.
{6790}{6901}Act like a processor,|people will think you're a processor.
{6907}{6962}Here's this morning's projections.
{6968}{7035}Thanks.|Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.
{7041}{7114}Joey is a fellow processor.
{7120}{7183}No kidding?
{7239}{7360}I process. People want the processing,|I'm the one they call.
{7366}{7444}- Where do you work?|- Well, I'm in between things.
{7450}{7529}You know, one day you're processing,|the next day...
{7535}{7599}...you're not so much|processing anymore.
{7605}{7664}I told Joey about the opening|in Fleischman's group.
{7670}{7709}Fleischman's group.
{7715}{7826}Whatever you do,|don't touch his sandwiches.
{7865}{7955}Are all you processors dorks?
{8062}{8138}This lipstick looks just great on you.
{8144}{8191}You look fabulous.|You really do.
{8197}{8271}Yeah, are you sure?|Really?
{8309}{8423}See, you look beautiful.|For God sakes, dim the lights.
{8439}{8475}I'm hideous!
{8481}{8514}It's gonna be okay.
{8520}{8556}Ryan's been underwater.
{8562}{8685}He's just gonna be glad you don't|have barnacles on your butt.
{8950}{9001}Come in.
{9007}{9043}Hey, baby, I'm back...
{9049}{9131}Hey, Ryan. What's up?
{9162}{9187}What's going on?
{9193}{9259}No, no.|You have to stay back.
{9265}{9335}I have the pox!
{9364}{9418}Chicken or small?
{9424}{9543}Chicken, which is so ironic|considering I'm a vegetarian.
{9544}{9631}- Why aren't you home in bed?|- My grandmother's never had chickenpox.
{9637}{9763}Please tell me you have, because|oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.
{9769}{9851}I'm sorry, I never had them.
{9877}{9958}If I had one wish,|I'd go back to when I was 7...
{9964}{10080}...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,|and rub that kid all over my face.
{10086}{10174}Yeah, or you could wish|that I didn't have them now.
{10180}{10210}Can I see your face?
{10216}{10283}No. You don't wanna see a face|covered with pox.
{10289}{10371}It could be lox, I wouldn't care.
{10377}{10451}And you hate fish.
{10464}{10506}So sweet. All right.
{10512}{10580}Okay, all right.|You can see.
{10586}{10667}This is me.
{10750}{10791}Sorry!
{10797}{10826}I am scary!
{10832}{10933}The lightening was|an unfortunate coincidence.
{10944}{10990}You look lovely!|Lovely!
{10996}{11031}I hate this.
{11037}{11110}I had the most amazing|two weeks planned for us.
{11116}{11237}And everything I had in mind,|we had to be a lot closer than this.
{11246}{11369}I've spent the last eight months|in a steel tube with men...
{11374}{11434}...thinking about this moment.
{11440}{11499}I am not gonna let a bunch...
{11505}{11595}...of itchy spots stand between us.
{11735}{11856}Okay. This is the most|romantic disease I've ever had.
{11982}{12045}- How's the first day?|- Good. It's like you said.
{12051}{12121}It's putting numbers|from one column into another.
{12127}{12152}There you go.
{12158}{12271}And everybody's nice. I just had|a good talk with that lady Jeannie.
{12277}{12360}Jeannie? The head of|East Coast operations, Jeannie?
{12366}{12462}Turns out our kids go|to the same school.
{12502}{12571}Yeah. Small world, huh?
{12577}{12631}Weird world.
{12637}{12660}Your kids?
{12666}{12750}I figure my character has kids.
{12756}{12856}There isn't a part of that sentence|I don't need explained.
{12862}{12933}When you're acting, you need|to think about that stuff.
{12939}{13018}My character,|Joseph the processing guy...
{13024}{13137}...has two little girls,|Ashley and Brittany.
{13140}{13228}Ashley copies everything|Brittany does.
{13329}{13436}Well, invisible kids|can be that way sometimes.
{13442}{13548}You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,|are thinking of having a third kid.
{13554}{13598}You know what?
{13604}{13667}Just did.
{13669}{13798}That's some pretty powerful|imaginary sperm you must have there.
{14030}{14080}Know what makes the itching worse?
{14086}{14171}That you don't stop talking about it?
{14177}{14243}- Fine.|- Let's just play, okay?
{14249}{14274}Good, okay.
{14280}{14335}Here we go, double sixes.
{14341}{14415}Here we go...
{14421}{14444}Here we go...
{14450}{14536}Come to Mama.|Getting ready to roll the dice...
{14542}{14592}What are you doing?|Are you scratching?
{14598}{14686}No. This is what I do|for luck, okay?
{14692}{14725}You're scratching.
{14731}{14758}Give me the dice.
{14764}{14825}- Give me the dice.|- No! Here. There!
{14831}{14903}Look, double sixes!
{14904}{14961}We can't scratch. We'll scar.
{14967}{15055}I can't stop thinking about it.|It's just so hard.
{15061}{15141}I wanna grab these houses|and rub them all over my body.
{15147}{15184}- No!|- Give it!
{15190}{15220}Come on!
{15226}{15290}You know you want it.|You know you want it too.
{15296}{15355}Let's just be bad.|It'll feel so good.
{15361}{15421}Come on.
{15427}{15507}Oh, God, help me.
{15517}{15563}- Oh, yeah.|- Okay, good. Now do me.
{15569}{15636}Do my back.|Oh, come on. Harder!
{15642}{15663}There you go.
{15669}{15690}- Don't move.|- Why?
{15696}{15782}- Don't move.|- What are you...?
{15844}{15904}Stop that.|Stop that right now.
{15910}{16048}I might've expected this of Phoebe.|But, Ryan, you're a military man.
{16120}{16208}You and Milton have to join us|on the boat. Bring the kids.
{16214}{16249}We'll make a day of it.
{16255}{16319}That sounds lovely.|We'll have to set it up.
{16325}{16389}I better get back.|Hope the baby feels better.
{16395}{16435}Thanks.
{16441}{16501}- Bye-bye, Jeannie.|- Bye-bye, Joseph.
{16507}{16582}What a phony.
{16616}{16737}You'll teach her a lesson when she|steps off the dock onto nothing.
{16740}{16780}- Hey, Mr. Douglas.|- Sir.
{16786}{16890}Bing, I got your memo. We're not gonna|see the report until next Friday?
{16896}{16958}My group wants to spend|the holiday with family.
{16964}{17030}I have a family.|I'm gonna be here.
{17036}{17126}Yeah, Bing.|What's that about?
{17207}{17281}It's about cutting them|a little slack for morale.
{17287}{17355}Look, I can get some|rough numbers by Wednesday.
{17361}{17429}Rough numbers?
{17435}{17541}This company wasn't built|on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?
{17547}{17614}Have the final numbers|on my desk by Tuesday.
{17620}{17684}If you say so, sir.
{17690}{17776}Joseph's good, isn't he?
{17790}{17850}I'm going to kill you.
{17856}{17961}Hey, I just figured Joseph's|the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.
{17967}{18068}You know, get in there,|ruffle some feathers.
{18074}{18139}Why?
{18150}{18234}Look, I'm sorry,|but that's what Joseph does.
{18240}{18293}Okay? If you try to pull something...
{18299}{18345}...he'll call you on it.
{18351}{18447}"What are you trying to pull?"|He'll say.
{18541}{18568}Duct tape.
{18574}{18656}Was I supposed to bring something too?
{18656}{18771}This is for the scratchy twins.|I taped oven mitts to their hands.
{18777}{18811}You're strict.
{18817}{18861}Well, it's for their own good.
{18867}{18976}You know, I like the way you have|efficiently folded this tab under.
{18982}{19115}See, in a tape emergency you could|shave valuable seconds off your time.
{19121}{19170}Exactly!
{19176}{19283}God, I love that I can be|totally neurotic around you now.
{19289}{19314}Tell me the truth.
{19320}{19396}Don't you like having everything|on your desk perpendicular?
{19402}{19494}If it's not a right angle,|it is a wrong angle.
{19500}{19526}- Very good.|- Thank you.
{19532}{19613}Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.
{19619}{19665}You're gonna do what to my clocks?
{19671}{19741}Set them to my time.
{19766}{19791}I'm confused.
{19797}{19866}I thought we shared time.
{19872}{19976}No. See, in my bedroom|I set my clock six minutes fast.
{19982}{20002}Wanna know why?
{20008}{20116}Because it's in a slightly different|time zone than the kitchen?
{20122}{20145}Forget it.
{20151}{20181}No, come on, tell me.
{20187}{20229}- You don't understand.|- Come on.
{20235}{20285}You don't have any obsessive things.
{20291}{20333}No, that's not true.
{20339}{20425}Oh, yeah?|Tell me one of yours.
{20557}{20666}One of my things is|I always separate my sweat socks...
{20672}{20766}...from my dress socks.
{20800}{20836}What if they get mixed up?
{20842}{20908}Boy, I would just...
{20914}{20981}I would freak out.
{20997}{21031}You would not.
{21037}{21123}I can't believe this.|I hate this. You're too normal.
{21129}{21178}I can't believe you|don't have a "thing".
{21184}{21245}My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing".
{21251}{21365}See, if anyone overheard that,|I didn't come off well.
{21550}{21676}- Mr. Douglas is looking for you.|- Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
{21682}{21781}He suspects you dropped the ball|on the Lender project.
{21787}{21870}Why? Why does he suspect that?
{21876}{21931}At first, he thought it was Joseph...
{21937}{22058}...but after he asked Joseph about it,|turns out it was you.
{22071}{22153}- Anyway, I thought you should know.|- All right. That's it.
{22159}{22189}Look, Joey...
{22195}{22263}...I realize this is the role|of a lifetime for you...
{22269}{22368}...and if I could just fire Joseph,|I would. But that's not possible.
{22374}{22452}So I have to let you both go.
{22464}{22513}What? Everybody loves Joseph.
{22519}{22594}I don't. I hate Joseph.
{22600}{22688}I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.
{22710}{22825}You can't fire Joseph.|He's not in your department.
{22912}{22999}All right, okay.|So I can't fire Joseph...
{23005}{23083}...but I can sleep with his wife.
{23129}{23150}Not Karen!
{23156}{23235}Yeah, I'm thinking about|having an affair with her.
{23241}{23283}You know what?
{23289}{23346}I just did.
{23396}{23437}What the hell are you doing?
{23443}{23473}Oh, it's not me.
{23479}{23528}It's my character!
{23534}{23584}Chandie.
{23590}{23668}The rogue processor who seduces|his coworkers' wives...
{23674}{23721}...and then laughs about it.
{23727}{23809}In fact, I have her panties|right there in my drawer!
{23815}{23911}- Really?|- No, freak show, she's fictional!
{23912}{23945}Take it easy.
{23951}{24075}If it means that much to you,|I'll go find something else.
{24081}{24148}Thank you.
{24157}{24251}It's just that|I'm gonna miss Joseph.
{24257}{24311}I liked him. His wife.
{24317}{24384}She was hot.
{24467}{24530}Please take these off.|I swear I won't scratch.
{24536}{24624}No, sorry, hon.|Monica's orders.
{24635}{24713}Well, that wasn't easy.
{24719}{24775}Okay, dinner's on.
{24781}{24834}There's a peach cobbler|warming in the oven.
{24840}{24975}So the plate's gonna be hot, but that|shouldn't be a problem for you.
{24980}{25024}All right, you kids.|Bye, now.
{25030}{25074}- Bye.|- Oh, look, look.
{25080}{25161}A low-budget puppet show.
{25176}{25287}A shame you can't see|what finger I'm holding up.
{25356}{25438}- Wine?|- Please.
{25644}{25736}- Spilled some.|- I got it.
{25982}{26037}You look beautiful tonight.
{26043}{26100}What?
{26114}{26171}Sorry.
{26212}{26273}You look beautiful.
{26649}{26741}You know what? That's it.|That's it.
{26898}{26955}Oh, yes.
{26977}{27034}Good.
{27135}{27204}You guys, did you...?
{27404}{27423}{y:i}Monica...
{27429}{27481}...wake up.
{27487}{27516}What's up?
{27522}{27591}I thought of a thing.
{27661}{27718}Yeah?
{27721}{27858}I have to sleep, have to,|on this side of the bed.
{27869}{27941}No. You have to sleep|on this side of the bed...
{27947}{28054}...because I have to sleep|on this side of the bed.
{28062}{28164}Or so I would have you believe.
{28204}{28296}So you have a side of the bed.|Everybody has a side of the bed.
{28302}{28375}Hey, come on. You haven't|heard my reason yet.
{28381}{28448}All right, go on.
{28454}{28510}I have to sleep on the west side...
{28516}{28589}...because I grew up in California...
{28595}{28640}...and otherwise...
{28646}{28757}...the ocean would be on the wrong side.
{28839}{28871}Oh, my God.
{28877}{28941}You're a freak!
{28947}{29017}How about that?
{29090}{29128}Where're you shipping off to?
{29134}{29161}I really can't say.
{29167}{29231}Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?
{29237}{29266}I can't say.
{29272}{29338}Do you get to look through|a periscope thingy?
{29344}{29388}I'm sorry, but I can't say.
{29394}{29476}Wow, it's neat learning|about submarines.
{29482}{29549}- I better not miss my flight.|- I'll walk you out.
{29555}{29649}- Bye, Ryan.|- Pleasure. Take care.
{29749}{29881}So do you think we could get you|one of those uniform things?
{29887}{29926}You like that, do you?
{29932}{29961}Oh, yeah.
{29967}{30037}I'll make some calls.
{30059}{30118}Can you believe that's how|we spent our two weeks?
{30124}{30167}We didn't do the romantic|things I'd planned...
{30173}{30283}...like having a picnic in Central Park|and coffee at Central Perk.
{30289}{30362}Oh, I just got that!
{30549}{30616}Taxi!
{30727}{30788}Bye, you.
{31097}{31168}I'm sorry, we're...
{31215}{31243}Hey, sailor.
{31249}{31324}Is this what you had in mind?
{31326}{31383}I'll say.
{31492}{31546}I'm shipping out tomorrow.
{31552}{31621}Well, then...
{31637}{31721}...we better make this night count.
{31742}{31847}Wait, I forgot to turn off|the cappuccino machine.
{32019}{32097}Anchors aweigh.
{32115}{32213}Oh, wait, wait!|My purse, my purse!
{32317}{32378}I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
{32384}{32470}Why don't I just meet you upstairs?
{32554}{32613}Honey!

00:00:03.14,00:00:05.37
All right, they got water,[br]orange juice. . .

00:00:05.74,00:00:08.01
. . .and what looks like cider.

00:00:08.62,00:00:09.50
Taste it.

00:00:14.42,00:00:15.37
Yeah, it's fat.

00:00:15.62,00:00:16.85
I drank fat!

00:00:18.54,00:00:20.50
I know, I did that two minutes ago.

00:00:24.22,00:00:25.62
Hey, Mr. Tux.

00:00:26.10,00:00:28.33
-Why aren't you dressed?[br]-We have a half-hour.

00:00:28.58,00:00:31.57
That was four minutes ago.[br]We have to be out the door at 7:40.

00:00:31.82,00:00:35.18
Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us[br]two minutes to get dressed.

00:00:35.42,00:00:37.49
I'd feel better if you[br]got dressed now.

00:00:37.98,00:00:39.33
-Okay.[br]-Okay.

00:00:43.02,00:00:44.98
Oh, look at you. All sexy.

00:00:45.22,00:00:46.10
Really?

00:00:51.22,00:00:55.90
-How come you didn't come over earlier?[br]-Because I' m a stupid, stupid man.

00:00:57.38,00:00:59.05
Hey, Ross, want some cider?

00:00:59.30,00:01:00.18
No.

00:01:01.62,00:01:03.29
So you' re pretty close, huh?

00:01:03.50,00:01:05.25
Makeup's on. Hair's done.

00:01:05.50,00:01:06.82
I just have to get dressed.

00:01:07.06,00:01:09.73
And that takes, what?[br]Just 6 or 7 minutes?

00:01:09.98,00:01:12.25
Yeah. Once I figure out[br]what I' m wearing.

00:01:14.94,00:01:16.05
Glass of fat?

What's the matter?[br]You nervous about your speech?

00:02:07.42,00:02:08.74
Nope.

00:02:10.22,00:02:12.05
-You wanna hear it?[br]-Am I in it?

00:02:16.82,00:02:19.57
After I thank everyone[br]for donating to the museum. . .

00:02:19.82,00:02:22.46
. . .I sing a song about the wonder[br]that is Joey.

00:02:26.42,00:02:27.93
Hello! You look great!

00:02:28.18,00:02:30.25
Thank you. I know, though.

00:02:31.78,00:02:35.45
You see this? This is a person[br]who is ready to go.

00:02:35.70,00:02:36.81
Phoebe, you. . . .

00:02:37.30,00:02:38.37
You are my star.

00:02:39.42,00:02:41.57
Well, you' re my lucky penny.

00:02:44.42,00:02:49.33
All right, I took the quiz. And it[br]turns out I do put career before men.

00:02:52.02,00:02:52.90
Get up.

00:02:53.38,00:02:54.18
What?

00:02:54.78,00:02:57.21
-You' re in my seat.[br]-How is this your seat?

00:03:00.54,00:03:01.73
I was sitting there.

00:03:01.94,00:03:03.34
But then you left.

00:03:03.90,00:03:06.33
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

00:03:07.14,00:03:09.37
I went to the bathroom.[br]You knew I'd be back.

00:03:09.62,00:03:11.34
What's the big deal?[br]Sit somewhere else!

00:03:11.54,00:03:14.93
The "big deal" is I was sitting[br]there last! So. . .

00:03:15.18,00:03:16.41
. . .it's my seat.

00:03:16.94,00:03:20.93
Well, actually, the last place[br]you were sitting was in there, so. . . .

00:03:21.42,00:03:23.85
You guys, you know what?[br]It doesn't matter.

00:03:24.10,00:03:28.46
You both have to go get dressed before[br]the big vein in my head pops.

00:03:28.70,00:03:31.37
I just have to do one thing.[br]It's not a big deal.

00:03:31.62,00:03:32.69
Get up!

00:03:35.62,00:03:37.77
Phoebe, you look great!

00:03:38.38,00:03:40.13
All right already.

00:03:41.02,00:03:42.82
Are you gonna do magic?

00:03:45.22,00:03:46.94
That's funny. Change.

00:03:47.14,00:03:48.97
-Hang on, I just got in.[br]-I don't care.

00:03:49.22,00:03:50.94
It starts at 8.[br]We can't be late.

00:03:51.18,00:03:53.93
"He could not, would not,[br]want to wait. "

00:03:54.62,00:03:57.26
Our table is down in front.[br]My boss will be there.

00:03:57.50,00:03:59.77
Everyone will see if we arrive[br]after it starts.

00:04:00.02,00:04:01.90
Has somebody been drinking my fat?

00:04:03.42,00:04:07.01
Does this look like something a[br]paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?

00:04:07.26,00:04:09.73
I don't know.[br]You might be the first one.

00:04:10.98,00:04:13.10
-Rach, did you check the machine?[br]-No.

00:04:13.50,00:04:17.25
Wait. This is the outfit that makes[br]my calves look fat. Never mind.

00:04:20.98,00:04:23.73
Well, Joey, I wrote[br]a little song today.

00:04:24.18,00:04:25.41
It's called, "Get up! "

00:04:26.62,00:04:29.18
All right. You can have the chair.

00:04:29.38,00:04:32.53
-Really?[br]-Oh, my. Would you look at that?

00:04:36.42,00:04:37.85
It's me, I'm coming over.

00:04:38.10,00:04:40.57
What if I'm already there[br]when you play this message?

00:04:40.82,00:04:42.62
Is that too spooky?

00:04:44.58,00:04:46.97
Hi, Rach, are you there?[br]It's me. Pick up.

00:04:47.42,00:04:49.14
Rachel? Rach?

00:04:49.62,00:04:50.77
What?

00:04:52.22,00:04:53.10
Never mind.

00:04:55.50,00:04:57.89
Monica, it's Richard. Call me.

00:05:01.42,00:05:02.90
Is that message old or new?

00:05:04.34,00:05:05.85
Old or new? Old or new?

00:05:06.10,00:05:08.82
It's definitely old.[br]Didn't you hear the double beep?

00:05:09.06,00:05:11.33
What if it's new?[br]We agreed not to talk.

00:05:11.54,00:05:14.21
It could be important.[br]Shouldn't I call him back?

00:05:14.46,00:05:16.73
Honey, you did call him back.[br]It's old.

00:05:16.94,00:05:18.93
Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.

00:05:19.14,00:05:21.18
When Carol and I broke up. . .

00:05:21.42,00:05:24.33
. . .I went through the same thing.[br]You know what I did?

00:05:24.54,00:05:26.45
I got dressed.

00:05:28.94,00:05:31.74
Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?

00:05:31.94,00:05:33.90
There we go. There we go.

00:05:34.62,00:05:36.97
You know what? Don't get up.[br]Just sit there.

00:05:37.22,00:05:40.13
I just hope you don't mind[br]my hand right here.

00:05:41.38,00:05:44.58
Not touching. Can't get mad![br]Not touching. Can't get mad!

00:05:44.82,00:05:46.86
Not touching. Can't get mad!

00:05:47.78,00:05:49.37
Oh, my God!

00:05:49.82,00:05:51.17
You rotten boys!

00:05:52.30,00:05:54.45
-Sorry, Phoebe.[br]-What am I gonna do?

00:05:54.70,00:05:56.45
Don't rub it![br]What gets out hummus?

00:05:56.70,00:05:58.29
What gets out hummus?

00:05:58.78,00:06:00.74
Monica![br]What gets out hummus?

00:06:01.74,00:06:04.94
If it is a new message,[br]what is he calling to say?

00:06:05.74,00:06:07.89
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.

00:06:09.42,00:06:11.54
Maybe he called to say[br]you' re obsessive and crazy?

00:06:11.78,00:06:13.90
-So should I call him back?[br]-No!

00:06:15.22,00:06:16.21
No!

00:06:18.22,00:06:21.13
-Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.[br]-Fine with me.

00:06:24.82,00:06:27.09
I am so comfortable.

00:06:28.30,00:06:29.21
Me too.

00:06:29.58,00:06:32.97
In fact, I think I might be[br]a little too comfortable.

00:06:36.98,00:06:40.37
Okay, we have 1 9 minutes.[br]I want you to go and change.

00:06:40.62,00:06:44.66
When you come back, Joey will go change[br]and he'll have vacated the chair.

00:06:45.02,00:06:46.05
-Okay.[br]-All right.

00:06:46.30,00:06:47.78
Fine. I' m going.

00:06:48.02,00:06:51.41
When I get back, it's Chair City.[br]And I' m the guy. . .

00:06:51.62,00:06:53.29
. . .who's sitting in a chair!

00:06:55.30,00:06:56.57
Is this a little too--

00:06:56.82,00:06:58.73
Pheebs? What happened?

00:06:58.94,00:07:00.17
I got the hummus.

00:07:00.42,00:07:04.21
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.[br]You wanna wear my black jacket?

00:07:04.42,00:07:06.54
-It won't go with this dress.[br]-You' re right.

00:07:06.78,00:07:10.98
-Well, let's just get you out of that.[br]-No, no, no. Not "out of that. "

00:07:11.18,00:07:14.30
-Not "out" of clothes.[br]-Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?

00:07:14.50,00:07:15.73
I called him.

00:07:16.54,00:07:19.53
Yes. I got his machine[br]and I left a message.

00:07:19.78,00:07:21.18
But it's okay. It's okay. . .

00:07:21.42,00:07:24.46
. . .because it was, like,[br]a casual, breezy message.

00:07:24.70,00:07:25.69
It was breezy.

00:07:26.58,00:07:28.38
Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?

00:07:28.58,00:07:32.78
How could it not be breezy? No.[br]Because you' re in such a breezy place.

00:07:33.50,00:07:37.54
I got it. I'll play my message and[br]you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.

00:07:37.74,00:07:39.73
But how you gonna do that?

00:07:40.34,00:07:42.73
I know the code[br]to his answering machine.

00:07:42.94,00:07:45.37
Okay, Mon, I really don't think[br]this is the--

00:07:45.62,00:07:48.21
Okay, you' re dialing.[br]You are dialing.

00:07:57.98,00:08:01.26
Hi, this is Richard.[br]Please leave a message at the tone.

00:08:02.82,00:08:04.46
You have two new messages.

00:08:04.90,00:08:06.25
What a cool job.

00:08:06.50,00:08:08.38
"You have two new messages. "

00:08:10.18,00:08:12.37
Please pass the pie.

00:08:14.62,00:08:17.13
Hi, it's Monica.[br]I'm just checking in.

00:08:17.34,00:08:20.46
I got a message and didn't know[br]if it was old or new.

00:08:20.70,00:08:22.61
So I'm just checking.

00:08:22.82,00:08:24.38
So let me know.

00:08:24.62,00:08:25.94
Or don't. Whatever.

00:08:26.18,00:08:27.66
I'm breezy!

00:08:29.02,00:08:32.33
You can't say you' re "breezy. "[br]That negates the "breezy. "

00:08:34.50,00:08:37.33
Hola. It's me.[br]Yesterday was really fun.

00:08:38.02,00:08:40.17
Call me about this weekend, okay?

00:08:43.34,00:08:44.90
Now, she sounded breezy.

00:08:48.74,00:08:52.25
He's seeing someone.[br]I can't believe he's seeing someone.

00:08:52.50,00:08:54.93
-You don't know that.[br]-Well, whose voice was that?

00:08:55.14,00:08:58.02
Maybe it was his sister's.[br]Maybe it was his daughter's.

00:08:59.34,00:09:02.49
Michelle. Of course![br]Did it sound like Michelle?

00:09:03.10,00:09:06.93
Oh, great. It's starting to rain.[br]That'll make it easier to get a cab.

00:09:07.90,00:09:08.85
It was Michelle.

00:09:09.10,00:09:10.74
It was definitely Michelle.

00:09:10.98,00:09:14.97
Try Monica's green dress. If it[br]doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.

00:09:15.22,00:09:17.65
-Unless I wear it.[br]-You don't know what you' re wearing?

00:09:17.90,00:09:20.37
I' m just trying to look nice[br]for your big night.

00:09:20.62,00:09:23.18
Yeah, which we have to leave for[br]in 1 2 minutes.

00:09:23.42,00:09:26.06
Come on, I'll just pick[br]something out for you.

00:09:26.30,00:09:28.45
You'll notice that I' m fully dressed.

00:09:28.70,00:09:31.93
I, in turn, have noticed[br]that you are not.

00:09:32.18,00:09:36.78
So in the words of A.A. Milne,[br]"Get out of my chair, dill-hole. "

00:09:39.14,00:09:40.46
Okay.

00:09:47.82,00:09:50.33
-What are you doing?[br]-You said to give you the chair.

00:09:50.58,00:09:52.54
You didn't say anything about cushions.

00:09:52.74,00:09:54.38
They' re the essence[br]of the chair!

00:09:54.62,00:09:57.13
That's right! I' m taking the essence.

00:09:58.18,00:09:59.93
Oh, he'll be back.

00:10:00.14,00:10:02.45
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

00:10:03.10,00:10:06.57
-I' m sorry, I thought it looked pretty.[br]-That was a Halloween costume.

00:10:06.82,00:10:09.97
Unless you would like me to go[br]as Little Bo Peep.

00:10:10.42,00:10:13.06
I didn't recognize it[br]without that inflatable sheep.

00:10:13.30,00:10:16.93
Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler,[br]I would like back one of these days.

00:10:19.46,00:10:21.97
Rach, good! Listen, isn't this[br]perfect for me?

00:10:22.22,00:10:24.45
Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

00:10:24.70,00:10:27.93
Of course, not for tonight.[br]Hi. I' m going to a benefit.

00:10:28.14,00:10:30.13
Not for tonight?[br]What are you doing?

00:10:30.38,00:10:33.58
No, I' m sorry. We didn't mean it.[br]I love you. Breathe.

00:10:34.90,00:10:37.78
We used them as pillows[br]when we went camping.

00:10:37.98,00:10:38.93
What?

00:10:39.90,00:10:41.05
The sheep.

00:10:42.42,00:10:45.09
Hey, what you do on your own time. . . .

00:10:48.62,00:10:50.34
Where's my underwear?

00:10:51.14,00:10:54.45
-Come on, you took his underwear?[br]-He took my essence!

00:10:54.70,00:10:59.33
Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear[br]the underwear you' re wearing now?

00:10:59.58,00:11:02.09
Because I' m not wearing[br]any underwear now.

00:11:03.22,00:11:05.53
Then why do you have[br]to wear underwear tonight?

00:11:05.78,00:11:07.45
It's a rented tux, okay?

00:11:07.70,00:11:10.85
I' m not gonna go commando[br]in another man's fatigues.

00:11:13.10,00:11:16.38
Then somebody's gonna have[br]to give somebody back his cushions.

00:11:17.18,00:11:21.17
Okay. You hide my clothes, I' m gonna[br]do the exact opposite to you.

00:11:23.42,00:11:26.41
What, are you gonna show me my clothes?

00:11:26.66,00:11:28.01
Hey, opposite. . .

00:11:28.98,00:11:30.13
. . .is opposite.

00:11:31.94,00:11:33.45
He's got nothing!

00:11:34.34,00:11:35.82
Okay, I' m ready.

00:11:40.90,00:11:43.94
Rachel didn't have anything I liked[br]but this ribbon.

00:11:44.14,00:11:46.45
I thought, all right,[br]I'll be political.

00:11:48.18,00:11:51.09
-What are you supporting?[br]-Christmas.

00:11:52.58,00:11:57.33
Hey, that's okay with me. Two down,[br]and I have exactly 1 2 minutes--

00:11:57.82,00:11:58.81
What?

00:11:59.82,00:12:02.25
My watch stopped.[br]My watch. Okay, see. . .

00:12:02.50,00:12:05.22
. . .the dinosaur tail[br]isn't going around anymore.

00:12:05.82,00:12:08.33
What time is it? It's 7:33.[br]I have 7 minutes.

00:12:08.54,00:12:09.65
I have seven minutes!

00:12:09.86,00:12:12.74
Which shoes should I wear?[br]The black or the purple?

00:12:13.02,00:12:15.33
-Just pick one, okay?[br]-Oh, okay, okay. The black.

00:12:15.54,00:12:17.73
Do you have black[br]with little strappies?

00:12:17.98,00:12:21.86
Yeah. But those go better with pants.[br]Maybe I should wear pants.

00:12:22.30,00:12:26.74
Yeah, pants! What an idea![br]Or better yet, go without pants.

00:12:26.98,00:12:29.94
I don't know what you' re doing,[br]but just get in there. . .

00:12:30.18,00:12:32.53
. . .and pick out any shoes[br]that fit your feet.

00:12:32.74,00:12:36.05
I don't care if they match.[br]I don't care if they make. . .

00:12:36.30,00:12:40.74
. . .your ankles or your knees or your[br]earlobes look fat. Just do it!

00:12:40.94,00:12:43.50
Go in there, pick something out[br]so we can go.

00:12:46.18,00:12:48.57
-All right.[br]-Thank you.

00:12:49.42,00:12:52.93
I've got to call Michelle to see[br]if that was her voice.

00:12:53.14,00:12:54.97
It was. It was her voice.

00:12:55.22,00:12:58.13
Monica, I think you've gone over[br]to the bad place.

00:13:02.02,00:13:03.74
Hola.

00:13:04.10,00:13:06.29
Hello? Hello?

00:13:07.62,00:13:10.58
-Okay. That was her, right?[br]-Definitely. Yeah.

00:13:10.82,00:13:12.33
So there you go.

00:13:12.74,00:13:15.94
We' re out of the woods.[br]I think I'll get dressed now.

00:13:17.42,00:13:19.09
-I'll get it.[br]-Okay.

00:13:20.34,00:13:21.74
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.

00:13:22.22,00:13:25.13
Yeah, just a second.[br]Can I ask who's calling?

00:13:25.42,00:13:26.65
It's Michelle!

00:13:28.78,00:13:32.53
She must have that "caller l.D. " thing.[br]You should get that.

00:13:35.42,00:13:36.45
Michelle?

00:13:36.90,00:13:40.73
Yeah, that was me.[br]I dialed your number by mistake.

00:13:40.98,00:13:42.05
Just try to be--

00:13:43.98,00:13:45.33
You' re so sweet.

00:13:46.02,00:13:47.98
Yeah, we were a great couple.

00:13:48.30,00:13:50.10
I know, I really miss him.

00:13:50.62,00:13:53.13
Well, you know how it is.[br]It's just that. . . .

00:13:53.34,00:13:54.93
You know what's weird?

00:13:56.82,00:13:58.81
Donald Duck never wore pants.

00:14:00.22,00:14:01.97
But when he gets[br]out of the shower. . .

00:14:02.22,00:14:04.69
. . .he always puts a towel[br]around his waist.

00:14:07.30,00:14:09.45
I mean, what is that about?

00:14:11.02,00:14:13.77
I only beeped in so I could[br]hear my own message.

00:14:14.02,00:14:15.25
I mean, that's allowed.

00:14:17.94,00:14:22.09
I would really appreciate it if you[br]wouldn't tell your dad about--

00:14:22.30,00:14:26.53
What do you mean, you don't feel[br]comfortable with this? We' re friends!

00:14:27.70,00:14:29.58
That bitch always hated me.

00:14:29.82,00:14:31.14
I' m calling her back.

00:14:33.30,00:14:34.97
-Okay, fine.[br]-Okay.

00:14:36.22,00:14:39.42
-She's got a phone in there, right?[br]-Okay, we' re on it.

00:14:50.02,00:14:53.53
I know it says "black tie optional" . . .

00:14:53.78,00:14:56.34
. . .but this may be pushing it a little.

00:14:56.74,00:14:58.30
I' m not gonna go.

00:15:00.38,00:15:01.57
You' re not gonna go?

00:15:01.82,00:15:05.33
No, I think I' m gonna catch up[br]on my correspondence.

00:15:06.74,00:15:09.49
How can you not be going?

00:15:10.22,00:15:11.45
I' m not gonna go.

00:15:11.70,00:15:15.25
So I think that will accomplish[br]the "not going. "

00:15:19.98,00:15:22.21
You know, just out of curiosity--

00:15:22.62,00:15:25.77
Ever since I was humiliated[br]and yelled at in front of my friends. . .

00:15:26.02,00:15:30.25
. . .I' m just, I don't know, not in a[br]very museum benefit-y kind of mood.

00:15:30.50,00:15:34.33
Right. Well, okay. Okay.[br]God, I' m sorry. I' m sorry I yelled.

00:15:34.54,00:15:36.66
-That's fine.[br]-No, but you' re mad.

00:15:36.90,00:15:38.73
I' m not mad. I' m just not going.

00:15:38.94,00:15:40.37
-Right.[br]-Okay.

00:15:41.62,00:15:44.58
You know that I have to go, right?

00:15:44.82,00:15:49.13
So is it gonna be, like,[br]I' m abandoning you while you' re upset?

00:15:49.34,00:15:50.17
-No.[br]-No?

00:15:50.42,00:15:54.33
-You' re not upset about the yelling.[br]-Right. And the humiliating.

00:15:54.54,00:15:56.53
Well, of course, the humiliating.

00:15:58.54,00:15:59.53
So we. . .

00:16:00.10,00:16:01.17
. . .we' re okay?

00:16:01.42,00:16:03.33
-We' re good.[br]-Right.

00:16:06.58,00:16:08.73
-Honey? I love you.[br]-Yes, Ross.

00:16:10.14,00:16:11.81
Get away from that phone!

00:16:14.42,00:16:16.33
She's just getting dressed now.

00:16:19.38,00:16:22.53
Is it wrong that I was[br]totally aroused by that?

00:16:30.10,00:16:32.53
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

00:16:32.94,00:16:36.61
You hide my clothes,[br]I' m wearing everything you own.

00:16:37.14,00:16:38.65
Oh, my God!

00:16:40.22,00:16:43.77
That is so not the opposite[br]of taking somebody's underwear!

00:16:44.02,00:16:45.53
Look at me! I' m Chandler.

00:16:45.74,00:16:48.54
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

00:16:50.10,00:16:52.29
Maybe if I wasn't going commando. . . .

00:16:57.22,00:16:59.37
It's hot with all this stuff on.

00:16:59.62,00:17:02.09
I better not do any,[br]I don't know, lunges.

00:17:04.70,00:17:06.97
Okay, enough.[br]Enough with the lunging.

00:17:07.22,00:17:09.73
I' m sick of this.[br]I've had it up to here.

00:17:09.94,00:17:12.33
Neither of you can come to the party!

00:17:12.82,00:17:14.25
Jeez, what a baby!

00:17:15.30,00:17:17.81
Way to ruin it.[br]I was just gonna go get dressed.

00:17:18.06,00:17:20.37
The only person[br]I cared about getting dressed. . .

00:17:20.62,00:17:22.93
. . .is the person who's[br]not even gonna go.

00:17:23.18,00:17:24.98
Look, Rach, I' m sorry, okay?

00:17:25.22,00:17:29.13
Look, I was a jerk, okay?[br]I' m sorry I yelled. I want you there.

00:17:29.38,00:17:30.57
I need you there.

00:17:32.22,00:17:35.97
What can I do to show you[br]how much I want you to be there?

00:17:37.14,00:17:38.94
You could drink the fat.

00:17:41.42,00:17:43.93
Welcome to an adult conversation.

00:17:44.34,00:17:46.53
No, no, no.[br]Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.

00:17:46.78,00:17:50.29
-That actually sounds interesting.[br]-What?

00:17:50.58,00:17:52.62
I think you should drink the fat.

00:17:58.74,00:18:02.57
Okay, if that's what it takes to[br]show you how much you mean to me. . .

00:18:02.82,00:18:05.38
. . .and how much I want you there,[br]that's what I'll do.

00:18:05.58,00:18:08.33
Let me get you another glass.[br]That's been sitting out.

00:18:09.02,00:18:10.93
I think this will be fine.

00:18:12.18,00:18:14.98
Okay, vanilla milkshake.[br]Just a vanilla milkshake. . .

00:18:15.22,00:18:17.94
. . .with chicken bits floating in it.

00:18:21.02,00:18:22.21
Cheers.

00:18:22.42,00:18:24.98
No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.[br]I'll go.

00:18:25.22,00:18:26.29
You will?

00:18:27.18,00:18:29.06
You were really gonna do that.

00:18:29.26,00:18:30.06
Well, yeah.

00:18:31.10,00:18:33.17
You were gonna drink the fat.

00:18:36.62,00:18:38.53
Let's see what else he'll do!

00:18:40.30,00:18:43.02
How about you get changed?[br]Give him his underwear.

00:18:43.22,00:18:46.37
I'll get a cab. I want everyone[br]downstairs in two minutes.

00:18:46.58,00:18:47.65
Monica!

00:18:48.30,00:18:49.13
Stop it.

00:18:49.34,00:18:50.49
Stop it!

00:18:54.78,00:18:56.37
Ross went to get a cab, so we--

00:18:56.62,00:18:59.13
What are you doing? No, Monica, no!

00:19:02.30,00:19:03.70
Hi, this is Richard.

00:19:05.50,00:19:07.93
You have three new messages.

00:19:08.94,00:19:10.42
Not anymore.

00:19:11.14,00:19:12.57
Message erased.

00:19:14.70,00:19:18.85
To record your message,[br]begin speaking at the tone.

00:19:19.94,00:19:21.85
Hi, Richard. It's Monica.

00:19:22.10,00:19:24.93
Listen, I did something[br]kind of crazy tonight.

00:19:25.14,00:19:27.94
Maybe I' m getting my period[br]or something. I don't know.

00:19:28.58,00:19:32.05
Anyway, I beeped into your machine[br]and I heard this message. . .

00:19:32.30,00:19:33.70
. . .that freaked me out. . .

00:19:34.30,00:19:36.86
. . .and Michelle will tell you the rest.

00:19:37.10,00:19:41.62
I' m sorry, okay? And I hope that we[br]can just forget the whole thing.

00:19:44.34,00:19:47.85
Your outgoing message[br]has now been changed.

00:19:48.98,00:19:49.86
Outgoing?

00:19:50.10,00:19:51.33
Did that say outgoing?

00:19:51.54,00:19:52.86
Not outgoing!

00:19:55.94,00:19:57.77
Hi, Richard, it's Monica.

00:19:58.02,00:20:00.82
Listen, I did something[br]kind of crazy tonight.

00:20:01.02,00:20:03.61
Maybe I'm getting my period[br]or something. I don't know.

00:20:03.82,00:20:06.17
-How did you do that?[br]-I don't know!

00:20:06.42,00:20:08.41
Goodbye.

00:20:11.22,00:20:15.34
Okay, I've got two cabs[br]and no people! Go, go, go!

00:20:15.54,00:20:18.66
Maybe we can call the phone company[br]to change the message?

00:20:18.90,00:20:20.13
They could change his number.

00:20:20.34,00:20:23.33
I think after this,[br]he'll be doing that himself.

00:20:25.22,00:20:26.02
Rachel!

00:20:31.82,00:20:34.33
You. . . .[br]You look. . . .

00:20:36.74,00:20:39.73
And I still have about[br]five seconds to spare.

00:20:45.62,00:20:47.18
That was about 7 seconds.

00:20:47.38,00:20:48.94
So we' re a little late.

00:20:49.14,00:20:50.86
Come on.

00:20:51.82,00:20:53.57
Oh, and by the way. . . .

00:20:53.82,00:20:54.62
What?

00:20:55.18,00:20:57.14
I' m going commando too.

00:21:07.82,00:21:08.85
Dr. Geller?

00:21:09.14,00:21:12.50
-Sherman Whitfield, London lnstitute.[br]-What a pleasure.

00:21:12.90,00:21:17.37
I was quite impressed with your[br]paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.

00:21:17.62,00:21:19.77
Yes. It confirmed everything[br]I'd written.

00:21:20.02,00:21:21.34
Excuse me.

00:21:21.58,00:21:22.53
Hi.

00:21:23.10,00:21:23.93
Yes?

00:21:24.38,00:21:26.10
You' re kind of sitting in my seat.

00:21:27.42,00:21:28.98
What do you mean, your seat?

00:21:29.54,00:21:32.34
-I mean, I was sitting there.[br]-But you got up.

00:21:32.54,00:21:34.58
But I never left the room.

00:21:35.30,00:21:37.53
But you left the chair area.

00:21:39.02,00:21:41.74
All right, that's it.[br]Give me your underwear.

00:00:16.77,00:00:20.76
Joe, that's why your parents[br]told you not to jump on the bed!

00:00:22.17,00:00:24.16
The One With the Jam

00:00:25.45,00:00:26.44
Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:01:10.25,00:01:13.32
Hey, look at me![br]I' m making jam!

00:01:13.57,00:01:17.53
-I've been at it since 4 a.m.[br]-Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.m.?

00:01:17.73,00:01:20.53
Down at the docks.[br]You know, you can get it wholesale.

00:01:21.25,00:01:22.97
I didn't know there were docks.

00:01:26.73,00:01:27.92
Is it broken?

00:01:28.13,00:01:30.48
No, but I gotta wear this[br]for a couple weeks.

00:01:30.85,00:01:33.68
You tell the doctor you did it[br]jumping on your bed?

00:01:34.49,00:01:37.64
No. I had a whole story[br]worked out, but then. . .

00:01:37.89,00:01:39.21
. . .Chandler sold me out.

00:01:39.41,00:01:43.32
I didn't think the doctor would buy[br]that it "fell out of the socket. "

00:01:45.69,00:01:47.84
What is this? Fruit?

00:01:51.01,00:01:52.16
Monica's making jam.

00:01:52.77,00:01:57.00
Jam? I love jam! How come[br]we never have jam at our place?

00:01:57.25,00:01:59.24
Because the kids need new shoes.

00:02:00.57,00:02:04.24
I' m going into business. I' m sick of[br]being depressed about Richard.

00:02:04.45,00:02:07.01
I needed a plan.[br]A plan to get over my man.

00:02:07.21,00:02:10.12
What's the opposite of man? Jam!

00:02:12.17,00:02:14.20
Joey, don't! It's way too hot!

00:02:20.97,00:02:22.88
This'll just be my batch.

00:02:40.33,00:02:41.12
That's it.

00:02:41.33,00:02:42.76
Hey, you, J . Crew guy. . . .

00:02:42.97,00:02:44.69
Why are you following me?

00:02:44.89,00:02:47.08
All week, everywhere I look,[br]there's you.

00:02:47.57,00:02:50.69
You wouldn't return my calls.[br]You sent back my letters.

00:02:50.93,00:02:53.04
One more chance, Ursula. Please.

00:02:56.57,00:02:57.64
This is awkward.

00:02:59.53,00:03:03.16
Yeah, because you want Ursula,[br]and I' m Phoebe. Twin sisters.

00:03:04.57,00:03:05.92
Seriously.

00:03:07.37,00:03:09.60
That's great.[br]I' m stalking the wrong woman.

00:03:09.89,00:03:11.96
I am such a dingus!

00:03:12.49,00:03:14.32
Oh, you' re not a dingus.

00:03:14.57,00:03:18.00
I just want you to know[br]I wasn't always like this.

00:03:18.33,00:03:22.56
Before I met your sister, I was a[br]normal guy who sold cellular phones.

00:03:24.49,00:03:27.00
Look, it's not your fault.

00:03:27.21,00:03:30.68
I mean, this is just[br]what she does to guys, okay?

00:03:32.45,00:03:33.60
Well, thanks.

00:03:34.01,00:03:36.28
Wait. I got a little story.

00:03:37.01,00:03:40.28
Once, in junior high school,[br]I thought I was a witch.

00:03:40.97,00:03:45.01
And a guidance counselor told me[br]something that might help you.

00:03:45.41,00:03:48.96
He said, "Okay, you' re not a witch.[br]You' re just an average student. "

00:03:50.33,00:03:52.72
-See what I' m saying?[br]-Not really.

00:03:54.21,00:03:55.56
Well, get over it.

00:03:58.33,00:04:01.48
You seem like a really nice guy.

00:04:02.89,00:04:04.96
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

00:04:05.17,00:04:09.16
You' re right. I know you' re right.[br]And thanks for being so nice.

00:04:11.89,00:04:13.37
Thanks a lot.

00:04:14.05,00:04:15.45
Want to get some coffee?

00:04:20.29,00:04:22.72
You don't have to[br]walk behind me anymore.

00:04:28.17,00:04:31.44
"Gone for more jars. Be back later.[br]Monica Geller. "

00:04:32.93,00:04:34.81
Wait a minute. Look!

00:04:36.57,00:04:38.72
It's an empty apartment.

00:04:38.97,00:04:41.96
We' re all alone[br]in an empty apartment.

00:04:42.97,00:04:45.32
I have to be at work[br]in 1 0 minutes.

00:04:46.13,00:04:50.12
All right. It's not like[br]I' m employee of the year or anything.

00:04:55.17,00:04:56.24
There it is!

00:04:56.49,00:04:58.37
Oh, that's what you mean.

00:05:01.29,00:05:02.32
Do I look fat?

00:05:03.05,00:05:04.24
No.

00:05:05.41,00:05:06.44
I accept that.

00:05:06.65,00:05:11.09
When Janice asked me and I said no,[br]she thought I was calling her a cow.

00:05:12.01,00:05:14.84
Walk us through it, honey.[br]Walk us through it.

00:05:15.33,00:05:20.24
Janice said, "Hi. Do I look fat[br]today?" And I looked at her--

00:05:21.69,00:05:23.28
You looked at her?

00:05:25.97,00:05:27.24
You never look.

00:05:28.29,00:05:32.33
You just answer. It's like a reflex.[br]"Do I look fat?" "No. "

00:05:35.09,00:05:37.52
"Is she prettier than I am?"[br]"No. "

00:05:38.61,00:05:39.88
"Does size matter?"

00:05:40.13,00:05:41.48
And it works both ways.

00:05:44.53,00:05:47.52
So you both just[br]know this stuff?

00:05:47.77,00:05:50.97
After 30 or 40 fights,[br]you kind of catch on.

00:05:52.41,00:05:54.16
Okay. For instance:

00:05:54.37,00:05:58.44
Janice is coming back from a trip.[br]She gives you two options.

00:05:58.65,00:06:01.77
Option one: She'll take a cab[br]home from the airport.

00:06:01.97,00:06:05.36
Option two: You can meet her[br]at baggage claim. What do you do?

00:06:05.61,00:06:06.60
Easy. Baggage claim.

00:06:06.85,00:06:08.60
Wrong! Now you' re single.

00:06:11.01,00:06:13.92
It's actually secret[br]option number three.

00:06:14.29,00:06:17.49
You meet her at the gate. That way[br]she knows you love her.

00:06:18.53,00:06:19.85
Okay, this is good.

00:06:20.05,00:06:23.48
All right, I have one.[br]Janice likes to cuddle. . .

00:06:23.69,00:06:26.04
. . .at night,[br]which I' m all for.

00:06:26.33,00:06:29.76
But when you want to go to sleep,[br]you want some space.

00:06:30.21,00:06:32.56
So how do I tell her that without. . .

00:06:32.85,00:06:35.92
. . .you know, accidentally[br]calling her fat or something?

00:06:36.33,00:06:40.48
Sorry, honey. We can't help you[br]there, because we' re cuddly sleepers.

00:06:41.89,00:06:43.45
I' m late for work.

00:06:43.65,00:06:47.04
-Are you guys coming down?[br]-Yeah. I' m right behind you.

00:06:47.25,00:06:49.05
Good luck, Chandler.

00:06:52.73,00:06:54.68
The sleeping thing.

00:06:55.81,00:06:58.24
very tricky business,[br]but solvable.

00:06:58.49,00:07:01.08
I thought you were "cuddly sleepers. "

00:07:03.33,00:07:05.84
No, not cuddly.[br]Not me. Just her.

00:07:06.09,00:07:08.08
I' m like you.[br]I need the room.

00:07:08.37,00:07:09.60
Okay, come here.

00:07:13.41,00:07:15.21
Okay. You' re in bed.

00:07:20.05,00:07:22.08
I'll use the cushion.

00:07:23.69,00:07:27.44
Okay. You' re in bed.[br]She's over on your side, cuddling.

00:07:27.69,00:07:30.60
Now, you wait for her to drift off. . .

00:07:31.01,00:07:32.96
. . .and then you hug her. . .

00:07:33.57,00:07:37.88
. . .and roll her over[br]to her side of the bed.

00:07:38.29,00:07:39.85
And then you. . .

00:07:41.17,00:07:43.12
. . .roll away.

00:07:44.89,00:07:46.56
Hug for her.

00:07:49.61,00:07:51.60
Roll for you.

00:07:53.21,00:07:54.72
The old "hug and roll. "

00:07:55.25,00:07:58.60
One question. You' re pretending[br]the pillow's a girl, right?

00:08:02.61,00:08:06.16
Remember when you were a kid, your[br]mom would send you to the movies. . .

00:08:06.37,00:08:08.88
. . .with a jar of jam[br]and a little spoon?

00:08:12.13,00:08:13.69
You' re so pretty.

00:08:20.53,00:08:24.28
You know that guy who's been[br]following me? I talked to him today.

00:08:24.53,00:08:27.00
You talked to him?[br]Are you crazy?

00:08:29.01,00:08:32.72
First, I' m not crazy.[br]And second, say it, don't spray it.

00:08:33.89,00:08:37.20
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,[br]and he wasn't following me.

00:08:37.41,00:08:40.08
I mean, he was,[br]but he thought I was Ursula.

00:08:42.57,00:08:45.77
That's why he couldn't just[br]come up and talk to me.

00:08:46.69,00:08:49.25
Because of the restraining order.

00:08:51.45,00:08:53.40
Not feeling better about Malcolm.

00:08:55.05,00:08:56.93
No, no, he's not a kook.

00:08:57.25,00:09:01.04
He's just this very passionate,[br]incredibly romantic guy. . .

00:09:01.33,00:09:04.05
. . .that just got[br]a teensy bit carried away.

00:09:04.33,00:09:06.97
We get along really well,[br]and he's so cute.

00:09:07.93,00:09:12.48
Oh, my God! You've got a crush[br]on your sister's stalker.

00:09:13.09,00:09:15.84
I' m going to help him get[br]"de-Ursula-ized. "

00:09:16.09,00:09:19.05
Like I did for Joey[br]after he went out with her.

00:09:19.25,00:09:20.44
I didn't stalk her.

00:09:21.53,00:09:24.00
I asked for the news,[br]not the weather.

00:09:28.17,00:09:31.37
Joey, this is for you.[br]It's blackberry currant.

00:09:37.97,00:09:39.53
Joe, I got to ask.

00:09:39.73,00:09:42.45
The girl from the xerox place,[br]buck naked. . .

00:09:43.45,00:09:45.52
. . .or a big tub of jam?

00:09:47.45,00:09:48.93
Put your hands together.

00:09:52.93,00:09:55.36
Take your time with that.[br]It's my last batch.

00:09:56.09,00:09:57.52
No more jam?

00:09:58.53,00:10:00.52
What happened to[br]your jam plan?

00:10:00.73,00:10:04.12
I figured out I'd need to charge[br]$ 1 7 a jar just to break even.

00:10:04.33,00:10:07.40
So I've got a new plan now.[br]Babies.

00:10:08.65,00:10:11.00
Well, you'll need[br]much bigger jars.

00:10:13.33,00:10:16.48
-What are you talking about?[br]-About me having a baby.

00:10:16.69,00:10:18.84
-Are you serious?[br]-Yeah.

00:10:19.09,00:10:22.21
The jam plan helped me[br]take control of my life.

00:10:22.41,00:10:25.21
So I thought, "What is[br]the most important thing to me?"

00:10:25.41,00:10:28.24
And that's when I came up[br]with the baby plan.

00:10:28.45,00:10:30.80
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:10:31.33,00:10:33.97
What is that guy's name?[br]Dad!

00:10:35.81,00:10:39.20
It took me 28 years to find a man[br]I wanted to spend my life with.

00:10:39.41,00:10:43.32
If I have to wait another 28 years,[br]I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

00:10:43.53,00:10:45.33
And that's just stupid.

00:10:46.69,00:10:48.49
That's what's stupid?

00:10:50.53,00:10:54.49
I don't need an actual man.[br]Just a few of his best swimmers.

00:10:56.05,00:10:59.12
And there are places[br]you can go to get that. . .stuff.

00:10:59.33,00:11:01.28
Down to the docks again?

00:11:11.05,00:11:13.48
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

00:11:15.13,00:11:16.64
Night-night. . .

00:11:17.49,00:11:18.64
. . .Janice.

00:11:22.61,00:11:25.00
Look at all the room on her side!

00:11:25.21,00:11:27.20
A giant penguin[br]could fit over there.

00:11:29.33,00:11:30.60
That'd be weird, though.

00:11:32.41,00:11:33.73
Hug and roll time.

00:11:33.93,00:11:36.12
I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

00:11:36.37,00:11:38.64
You're rolling, and....

00:11:39.25,00:11:40.76
Yes! Freedom!

00:11:41.49,00:11:43.32
Except for this arm!

00:11:43.97,00:11:46.16
I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

00:11:47.73,00:11:50.93
Time for the old tablecloth trick.[br]One fluid motion.

00:11:51.13,00:11:52.77
Quick like a cat.

00:11:52.97,00:11:55.44
And one, two...

00:11:56.05,00:11:57.20
... three!

00:12:04.41,00:12:06.13
Here's my binoculars.

00:12:06.33,00:12:08.76
Oh, great.[br]You' re doing great.

00:12:09.05,00:12:11.00
Going strong. Keep going.

00:12:12.25,00:12:14.40
These are my night-vision goggles.

00:12:15.13,00:12:18.72
This is the book I pretend to read[br]when I' m watching her in the park.

00:12:19.61,00:12:22.96
And these are Madlibs.[br]They' re just for fun.

00:12:25.25,00:12:29.08
This is the log I kept,[br]recording her every movement.

00:12:29.77,00:12:31.36
Want to hear some of it?

00:12:31.57,00:12:33.24
Not even a little bit.

00:12:34.65,00:12:35.60
It's about you.

00:12:35.89,00:12:37.48
Okay then.

00:12:42.45,00:12:44.17
"I met Phoebe today.

00:12:44.69,00:12:47.65
She was really nice to me[br]even though I' m such a loser.

00:12:48.89,00:12:51.72
And when I was walking home,[br]I thought about her a lot.

00:12:51.97,00:12:54.88
It was weird, but kind of cool. "

00:12:55.97,00:12:56.96
Good.

00:12:58.37,00:13:00.25
So what were you thinking?

00:13:01.33,00:13:03.84
I was thinking what it'd be[br]like to kiss you.

00:13:04.05,00:13:05.37
-Really?[br]-No.

00:13:08.53,00:13:11.96
That's just something I said now[br]so that maybe I could kiss you.

00:13:12.45,00:13:13.64
Oh, okay.

00:13:19.89,00:13:22.45
No, it's all right.[br]I just had a jar of mustard.

00:13:23.97,00:13:28.80
Okay. Sperm donor number 0381 5,[br]come on down!

00:13:29.93,00:13:31.65
Okay, he's 6' 2", 1 70 pounds.

00:13:31.89,00:13:34.85
He describes himself[br]as a male Gina Davis.

00:13:35.09,00:13:36.97
You mean there's[br]more than one of us?

00:13:38.77,00:13:41.89
You can't do this, Mon.[br]If you do this, I'll--

00:13:42.13,00:13:44.64
-You'll what?[br]-I'll tell Mom.

00:13:45.65,00:13:49.20
I' m sorry, but he's right.[br]I love you, but you' re crazy.

00:13:49.53,00:13:51.96
Why? Why is this crazy?

00:13:52.37,00:13:54.80
-So this isn't the ideal way--[br]-Oh, it's not--

00:13:55.05,00:13:56.77
Lips moving. Still talking.

00:13:57.97,00:13:59.92
It may not be ideal, but. . .

00:14:00.17,00:14:01.89
. . .I' m so ready.

00:14:02.45,00:14:04.52
I see the way[br]Ben looks at you.

00:14:05.09,00:14:07.36
It makes me ache, you know?

00:14:07.85,00:14:09.68
Check it out! Jam crackers!

00:14:13.85,00:14:15.92
Okay. All right, how's this?

00:14:16.17,00:14:18.84
Twenty-seven, ltalian-American guy.

00:14:19.09,00:14:20.60
He's an actor.

00:14:20.89,00:14:22.48
Born in Queens.

00:14:22.73,00:14:25.80
Wow! Big family.[br]Seven sisters. . .

00:14:26.69,00:14:28.72
. . .and he's the only. . .boy.

00:14:32.89,00:14:36.32
Oh, my God! Under personal comments:[br]"New York Knicks rule. "

00:14:36.53,00:14:38.01
Yeah, the Knicks rule!

00:14:41.85,00:14:43.65
Joey, this is you!

00:14:44.25,00:14:45.48
Let me see.

00:14:47.85,00:14:48.92
Oh, right!

00:14:50.21,00:14:51.88
You went to a sperm bank?

00:14:52.09,00:14:54.76
Right after I did that[br]sex study at NYU.

00:14:54.97,00:14:56.61
Remember that sweater I gave you?

00:14:57.65,00:14:59.72
That's how you bought it?

00:15:00.73,00:15:03.64
No. That's what I was wearing[br]when I donated.

00:15:06.77,00:15:09.65
I' m surprised there's any[br]of my boys left.

00:15:10.37,00:15:14.16
It is pretty competitive. There's[br]an actual rocket scientist here.

00:15:14.37,00:15:18.20
Maybe I should have them put my[br]Days of our Lives gig on here.

00:15:18.73,00:15:20.37
Juice this up a little.

00:15:23.57,00:15:25.21
How's the maniac?

00:15:25.65,00:15:28.08
He's yummy.[br]We did a little kissing.

00:15:29.41,00:15:31.21
Phoebe, what are you doing?

00:15:31.45,00:15:35.60
No, no. He's not into that anymore.[br]He quit for me.

00:15:36.65,00:15:40.88
This guy has been obsessed with[br]your sister for God knows how long.

00:15:41.09,00:15:43.65
You don't just give that up.

00:15:44.09,00:15:47.13
He gave me his night-vision[br]goggles and everything.

00:15:48.05,00:15:51.84
You' re taking the word of a guy[br]who has night-vision goggles?

00:15:52.09,00:15:55.76
He's not still following her.[br]You think he's still following her?

00:15:55.97,00:15:58.88
Wake up and smell[br]the restraining order.

00:16:00.77,00:16:02.00
What should I do?

00:16:02.25,00:16:05.13
If you really like this guy,[br]you should just trust him.

00:16:05.37,00:16:06.85
Thank you, Monica.

00:16:07.37,00:16:09.20
Or you could follow him.

00:16:09.41,00:16:11.48
That's what I'd do.[br]Forget mine.

00:16:14.97,00:16:16.16
What happened?

00:16:16.41,00:16:18.64
Crazy Chandler spun me. . .

00:16:18.85,00:16:20.36
. . .off the bed.

00:16:20.69,00:16:23.28
Wow! Spinning![br]Sounds like fun.

00:16:25.37,00:16:26.72
I wish.

00:16:26.97,00:16:30.36
He was just trying[br]Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

00:16:33.93,00:16:35.20
Ross' what?

00:16:35.41,00:16:38.64
Where he hugs you[br]and then he rolls you away, and. . . .

00:16:42.09,00:16:45.24
Oh. . .my. . .God!

00:17:21.09,00:17:22.12
What are you doing?

00:17:22.53,00:17:25.49
Oh, I was just here looking[br]for my. . .my. . . .

00:17:25.81,00:17:27.92
Part of an old sandwich.[br]Here it is!

00:17:30.53,00:17:32.12
Were you following me?

00:17:32.81,00:17:34.08
Perhaps.

00:17:35.65,00:17:37.53
Yes. I' m sorry.

00:17:37.73,00:17:40.69
I was afraid you were still[br]hung up on my sister.

00:17:40.89,00:17:42.72
So you spied on me.

00:17:43.61,00:17:45.60
I can't believe[br]you don't trust me.

00:17:51.21,00:17:55.36
Well, what do you know?[br]There goes my identical twin sister!

00:17:55.65,00:17:58.12
Just walking along, looking like me.

00:17:59.53,00:18:03.28
Is this a freakish coincidence, or[br]did you know she takes this train?

00:18:03.81,00:18:05.56
I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

00:18:06.09,00:18:08.40
I tried to stop,[br]but I couldn't.

00:18:09.01,00:18:10.65
I' m so pathetic.

00:18:10.85,00:18:14.60
No, it's not your fault.[br]It's partly my fault.

00:18:14.97,00:18:17.32
I made you quit cold turkey.

00:18:18.89,00:18:22.40
Well, I can't date you anymore[br]because you' re, you know. . . .

00:18:22.61,00:18:23.76
Wow!

00:18:25.77,00:18:29.73
But I will definitely help you[br]get over my sister. Okay?

00:18:30.57,00:18:32.72
Stalk me for a while, huh?

00:18:34.81,00:18:36.88
I'll be like an Ursula patch.

00:18:38.13,00:18:39.16
I don't know.

00:18:39.45,00:18:41.56
Just. . . .[br]Look, I' m going!

00:18:42.33,00:18:43.08
Come on.

00:18:44.57,00:18:47.48
I' m on the pillar.[br]Which way will I go?

00:18:50.93,00:18:52.88
-Where you going?[br]-To the bank.

00:18:53.37,00:18:55.04
Sperm or regular?

00:18:56.45,00:18:57.88
Sperm.

00:18:58.13,00:18:59.40
You' re really doing it?

00:18:59.65,00:19:02.32
Oh, yeah. I picked a guy.[br]37 1 35.

00:19:02.97,00:19:04.16
Sounds nice.

00:19:04.41,00:19:07.08
He does. He's got[br]brown hair and green eyes.

00:19:07.29,00:19:08.69
No kidding?

00:19:10.09,00:19:11.92
I figured you'd have picked[br]a blond.

00:19:12.53,00:19:13.96
Really? Why?

00:19:14.57,00:19:19.32
I always pictured you with a tall,[br]smart, blond guy with a name like. . .

00:19:19.57,00:19:20.36
. . .Hoyt.

00:19:22.97,00:19:24.12
It's a name. Yeah.

00:19:25.81,00:19:29.64
I saw you in this great house[br]with a big pool.

00:19:30.57,00:19:32.08
Is he a swimmer?

00:19:33.01,00:19:34.44
He's got the body for it.

00:19:35.61,00:19:37.01
I like that.

00:19:40.01,00:19:40.60
What?

00:19:40.89,00:19:42.84
You have a sign that says:

00:19:43.05,00:19:46.04
"We don't swim in your toilet.[br]Don't pee in our pool. "

00:19:46.25,00:19:47.76
We don't have that sign.

00:19:48.01,00:19:49.49
You do![br]It was a gift from me.

00:19:51.93,00:19:53.81
And you have three great kids.

00:19:54.01,00:19:55.68
Two girls and a boy?

00:19:57.49,00:20:01.61
And they wear little water wings,[br]and they run around on the deck.

00:20:01.81,00:20:04.45
And Hoyt wraps a towel[br]around all three of them.

00:20:04.65,00:20:05.48
Sure.

00:20:11.69,00:20:14.52
But, you know,[br]this way sounds good too.

00:20:16.25,00:20:17.32
Yeah.

00:20:29.53,00:20:31.68
Wow! This guy's an astronaut?

00:20:33.25,00:20:35.24
That would have been cool. . .

00:20:35.97,00:20:37.48
. . .for a day.

00:20:44.81,00:20:46.24
I called the sperm bank.

00:20:46.49,00:20:49.45
They haven't sold a single unit[br]of Tribbiani.

00:20:49.89,00:20:51.53
Nobody wants my product.

00:20:53.45,00:20:55.28
I don't get it.

00:21:01.53,00:21:03.36
Maybe if they met me in person.

00:21:05.13,00:21:06.72
You got a thing on your. . . .

00:21:11.33,00:21:12.12
Get it?

00:21:13.29,00:21:14.40
Yeah.

00:21:16.53,00:21:17.68
Hello.

00:21:19.45,00:21:20.52
Hello.

00:21:28.65,00:21:30.92
Chan, can I talk to you[br]for a second?

00:21:31.13,00:21:32.48
Sure. What's up?

00:21:33.25,00:21:36.05
Just one additional[br]relationship thought.

00:21:36.25,00:21:38.56
Something you' re probably aware of.

00:21:39.17,00:21:40.68
Women talk.

00:00:06.22,00:00:09.22
Welcome, everybody![br]Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!

00:00:10.58,00:00:11.78
It's on again!

00:00:11.98,00:00:14.21
Guys, could we please[br]not watch this?

00:00:14.94,00:00:18.06
This ever happen to you?[br]You go to get a glass of milk...

00:00:18.30,00:00:21.46
...but these cartons are so[br]flinging, flanging hard to open!

00:00:21.66,00:00:23.46
Boy, you said it, Mike.

00:00:25.98,00:00:29.22
-There's gotta be a better way.[br]-There is, Kevin!

00:00:29.66,00:00:32.78
-Can we please turn this off?[br]-No way, Kevin!

00:00:32.98,00:00:36.45
What if I told you there's[br]a new product that guarantees...

00:00:36.70,00:00:39.46
... you'll never have to open up[br]milk cartons again?

00:00:39.70,00:00:41.82
Meet the Milkmaster 2000!

00:00:43.98,00:00:46.54
-Intrigued?[br]-You' re flinging, flanging right I am!

00:00:48.22,00:00:52.54
This is the first time he's used this.[br]You'll see how easy this is to do.

00:00:53.38,00:00:56.34
-This works in any milk carton.[br]-Wow, it is easy!

00:00:56.54,00:00:58.82
Now I can have milk every day.

00:01:02.30,00:01:04.37
The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel

00:01:05.62,00:01:06.61
Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:01:50.30,00:01:52.61
It's official.[br]There are no good movies.

00:01:52.82,00:01:55.29
So let's go to a bad one,[br]and make out.

00:01:59.42,00:02:03.82
Perhaps you'd like me to turn[br]so you can bunny-bump against my back?

00:02:06.82,00:02:09.62
-Hey, man. What's up?[br]-Maybe you can tell me.

00:02:09.86,00:02:13.33
My agent wants to know why I didn't[br]show up at my audition today. . .

00:02:13.58,00:02:17.02
. . .my first good one in weeks.[br]How could you not give me the message?

00:02:17.22,00:02:19.78
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt. . .

00:02:20.30,00:02:21.94
. . .but it wasn't me.

00:02:22.18,00:02:24.02
Yes, it was.[br]It was him!

00:02:25.86,00:02:27.18
Okay, it was me!

00:02:29.26,00:02:32.46
-How was it you?[br]-Well, it was all so crazy, you know?

00:02:32.70,00:02:35.46
Chandler was in the closet,[br]counting to 1 0. . .

00:02:35.70,00:02:37.66
. . .and I hadn't found a place[br]to hide yet.

00:02:39.10,00:02:43.22
I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all[br]down on my hand. See? All of it.

00:02:43.66,00:02:45.42
Yep, that's my audition.

00:02:45.70,00:02:48.42
See? Now, this is why I keep[br]notepads everywhere.

00:02:48.62,00:02:51.42
Yep. And that's why we don't[br]invite you to play.

00:02:52.46,00:02:55.82
What is the great tragedy here?[br]Get yourself another appointment.

00:02:56.06,00:02:59.85
Estelle tried. The casting director[br]told her I missed my chance.

00:03:00.10,00:03:01.25
Well, that is unfair!

00:03:01.66,00:03:04.02
I'll call her.[br]I'll tell her it was my fault.

00:03:04.22,00:03:07.02
You can't. The casting director[br]doesn't talk to friends.

00:03:07.22,00:03:10.38
-She only talks to agents.[br]-What a sad little life she must lead.

00:03:13.90,00:03:16.62
-What are you doing?[br]-No, I know, I know.

00:03:17.86,00:03:21.14
Hi, this is Caitlin[br]from Phoebe Buffay's office.

00:03:22.18,00:03:24.65
Is Anne there for Phoebe?

00:03:25.06,00:03:27.10
She'll know what it's about.

00:03:27.30,00:03:28.70
Hang up. Hang up right--

00:03:30.62,00:03:34.06
Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got[br]a problem with Joey Tribbiani.

00:03:34.30,00:03:37.61
Apparently, he missed his audition.[br]Who did you speak to in my office?

00:03:37.86,00:03:39.93
Estelle? I don't know[br]what to do with her.

00:03:40.18,00:03:44.30
So your husband leaves and burns down[br]the apartment. The world doesn't stop.

00:03:45.42,00:03:46.94
Is anybody else scared?

00:03:48.46,00:03:52.22
If Joey loses this audition, then[br]that is it for Estelle. I don't care!

00:03:53.18,00:03:56.86
Annie, you are a doll. What time can[br]you see him? I need a pen. Pen!

00:04:03.50,00:04:06.97
Get the woman a pad![br]Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!

00:04:07.42,00:04:09.98
Oh, now you want a pad.

00:04:14.62,00:04:16.46
Where's my boy?

00:04:16.70,00:04:18.66
Here's my boy!

00:04:18.90,00:04:21.74
And here's his Barbie!

00:04:27.66,00:04:29.54
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?

00:04:30.58,00:04:33.05
He picked it out at the store.[br]He loves it.

00:04:33.30,00:04:35.74
He carries it everywhere,[br]like a security blanket.

00:04:35.98,00:04:38.58
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.

00:04:39.78,00:04:41.42
Yeah, it's cute.

00:04:41.62,00:04:44.46
Why does he have it again?

00:04:44.70,00:04:46.77
So he's got a doll. So what?

00:04:48.30,00:04:51.66
Unless you' re afraid[br]he's gonna grow up to be. . .

00:04:51.90,00:04:53.46
. . .in show business.

00:04:54.06,00:04:55.94
This wouldn't have[br]to do with the fact. . .

00:04:56.18,00:04:58.22
. . .that he's being raised[br]by two women?

00:04:59.58,00:05:04.26
You know what? It's fine. If you' re[br]okay with the Barbie thing, so am l.

00:05:04.50,00:05:07.62
Give Daddy the Barbie.[br]Give me the Barbie.

00:05:07.82,00:05:10.82
Don't you wanna play[br]with a monster truck?

00:05:12.10,00:05:13.33
No? Okay.

00:05:13.90,00:05:16.70
How about a Dino-Soldier?

00:05:21.62,00:05:22.90
You are so pathetic.

00:05:23.14,00:05:26.22
Why can't your son[br]just play with his doll?

00:05:32.50,00:05:34.10
I gotta go to work.

00:05:35.70,00:05:37.34
Has anybody seen my left boob?

00:05:39.26,00:05:40.78
I loved that movie.

00:05:44.78,00:05:46.74
Here it is.[br]What are you doing?

00:05:47.46,00:05:49.50
I' m sorry. It just felt nice.

00:05:53.30,00:05:54.45
Answer the phone.

00:05:54.82,00:05:58.26
I only got one arm. You should[br]do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.

00:05:59.70,00:06:01.22
Just do it! It's Janice.

00:06:01.46,00:06:03.82
And if I get it, I'll have[br]to see her tonight.

00:06:05.90,00:06:08.13
That's great.[br]I'll have to see her tonight.

00:06:08.38,00:06:10.50
Why don't you want to see Janice?

00:06:10.74,00:06:12.81
Last night at dinner,[br]when the meals came. . .

00:06:13.06,00:06:17.62
. . .she put half her chicken piccata[br]on my plate and took all my tomatoes.

00:06:19.46,00:06:21.38
And that's bad. . .

00:06:21.66,00:06:23.86
. . .because you hate chicken piccata?

00:06:25.78,00:06:29.62
You didn't want to share your tomatoes.[br]Tomatoes are very important to you.

00:06:30.18,00:06:32.02
Suddenly, we were this "couple. "

00:06:32.22,00:06:34.66
And this alarm started going off[br]in my head.

00:06:34.90,00:06:36.97
"Run for your life![br]Get out of the building! "

00:06:38.42,00:06:40.10
Men are unbelievable.

00:06:40.34,00:06:41.82
What is it with you people?

00:06:42.06,00:06:44.90
The minute you feel something,[br]you have to run away?

00:06:45.38,00:06:46.61
I know. That--

00:06:48.46,00:06:52.74
That's why I don't want to go tonight.[br]I' m afraid I'll say something stupid.

00:06:52.94,00:06:56.02
You mean that "guy thing" where[br]you act mean and distant. . .

00:06:56.22,00:06:57.86
. . .until we break up with you?

00:06:58.14,00:06:59.29
You know about that?

00:07:01.10,00:07:02.62
What do I do?[br]I wanna get past this.

00:07:02.86,00:07:05.01
I don't want to be afraid[br]of commitment.

00:07:05.26,00:07:08.62
I want to go through the tunnel[br]to the other side!

00:07:09.58,00:07:11.78
Where there's no fear of commitment.

00:07:12.90,00:07:14.18
Do we have any--

00:07:18.90,00:07:20.38
Do we have any thoughts here?

00:07:20.90,00:07:23.26
I've never been through[br]the tunnel myself because. . .

00:07:23.50,00:07:26.78
. . .you' re not allowed through[br]with more than one girl in the car.

00:07:28.98,00:07:33.06
But it seems to me it's pretty much[br]like anything else. Face your fear.

00:07:33.30,00:07:36.06
Fear of heights?[br]Go to the top of the building.

00:07:36.30,00:07:37.62
You' re afraid of bugs.

00:07:38.82,00:07:40.05
Get a bug.

00:07:42.74,00:07:44.42
You have a fear of commitment.

00:07:44.62,00:07:48.86
So I say you go in there and you be[br]the most committed guy there ever was!

00:07:49.10,00:07:51.25
Amazingly, that makes sense.

00:07:52.10,00:07:54.94
-Do you think?[br]-Oh, yeah! Go for it, man!

00:07:55.18,00:07:56.25
Jump off the high dive!

00:07:56.50,00:08:00.02
Stare down the barrel of the gun![br]Pee into the wind!

00:08:01.70,00:08:04.01
If I' m staring down[br]the barrel of a gun. . .

00:08:04.22,00:08:06.98
. . .I' m gonna be pretty much peeing[br]every which way.

00:08:12.22,00:08:14.45
It's your audition from this morning!

00:08:14.98,00:08:16.02
Can I use the phone?

00:08:16.26,00:08:20.62
Sure, that's what it's there for.[br]Emergencies and pretend agents.

00:08:21.66,00:08:23.10
Come on, baby! Come on!

00:08:25.10,00:08:27.94
Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay[br]returning a page.

00:08:28.18,00:08:31.54
Okay, she's in her car.[br]I'll have to patch you through.

00:08:31.78,00:08:33.38
very nice touch.

00:08:34.70,00:08:35.90
Okay, go ahead.

00:08:37.38,00:08:38.53
Talk, talk, talk!

00:08:39.90,00:08:40.94
Hi, Annie?

00:08:41.50,00:08:42.73
Fantastic. You got it!

00:08:45.58,00:08:49.90
Will he work for scale, you ask me?[br]Well, I don't know about that.

00:08:50.14,00:08:52.02
Except that I do and he will.

00:08:52.70,00:08:54.98
Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.

00:08:55.30,00:08:57.34
I would love to have lunch with you!

00:08:57.62,00:09:00.34
How about we have lunch next--

00:09:00.58,00:09:02.02
Went through a tunnel.

00:09:02.70,00:09:03.66
Unbelievable.

00:09:03.90,00:09:05.58
Oh, thank you so much!

00:09:06.02,00:09:10.06
It was really fun. I mean, I've never[br]talked on a car phone before.

00:09:10.90,00:09:13.62
You are so amazing![br]Could you do me this huge favor?

00:09:13.86,00:09:17.22
There's another audition I want,[br]and Estelle couldn't get me in.

00:09:17.46,00:09:19.82
I don't know.[br]It was fun one time, but--

00:09:20.06,00:09:22.34
Please? It would just be[br]this one more.

00:09:22.58,00:09:23.94
Well, actually it's two.

00:09:24.18,00:09:25.22
Two?

00:09:25.46,00:09:26.90
Well, really it's three.

00:09:27.30,00:09:30.61
Please? You' re so good at it.[br]I love you.

00:09:31.70,00:09:33.46
Okay. But just these three, right?

00:09:33.70,00:09:34.93
No, it's four.

00:09:39.22,00:09:41.26
So how come you wanted[br]to eat in tonight?

00:09:42.02,00:09:44.02
Because I wanted. . .

00:09:44.22,00:09:45.74
. . .to give you this.

00:09:47.22,00:09:49.66
Are you a puppy!

00:09:54.10,00:09:55.42
Contact paper!

00:09:57.02,00:09:59.62
What do you say when someone[br]you' re sleeping with. . .

00:09:59.82,00:10:01.54
. . .gives you contact paper?

00:10:02.22,00:10:06.34
Wait, there's more.[br]See, the contact paper is to go. . .

00:10:06.58,00:10:08.62
. . .in your brand new drawer!

00:10:11.22,00:10:13.45
See, the drawer actually[br]goes in my dresser.

00:10:14.42,00:10:17.02
You didn't have to do this.

00:10:17.50,00:10:18.57
Yes, I did.

00:10:18.78,00:10:21.14
Yes, I did.[br]Because you' re my girlfriend. . .

00:10:21.38,00:10:24.10
. . .and that's what girlfriends[br]should get.

00:10:26.10,00:10:28.49
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. . .

00:10:30.10,00:10:32.62
. . .because, oh, my God!

00:10:33.82,00:10:35.89
Who would've thought that someday. . .

00:10:36.10,00:10:39.02
. . .Chandler Bing would buy me[br]a drawer?

00:10:40.38,00:10:41.42
Well, not me.

00:10:43.26,00:10:46.38
But that's what's happened.[br]And there's more.

00:10:48.30,00:10:49.94
We should take a trip.

00:10:50.66,00:10:51.65
We should?

00:10:51.90,00:10:54.37
We' re a couple,[br]and that's what couples do.

00:10:55.06,00:10:56.94
And I wanna meet your parents.

00:10:57.18,00:10:59.90
We should take a trip[br]with your parents!

00:11:03.86,00:11:08.22
I don't think we need to because[br]you' re tripping me out right now!

00:11:09.18,00:11:10.25
Are you okay?

00:11:10.50,00:11:11.30
No, I am.

00:11:11.98,00:11:13.82
I actually am! This is amazing.

00:11:14.02,00:11:17.14
My entire life, I have feared[br]this place.

00:11:17.38,00:11:19.85
And now that I' m here, it's like,[br]what was the big deal?

00:11:20.10,00:11:23.86
I could probably say, "Let's move in[br]together," and I'd be okay.

00:11:24.30,00:11:26.53
You probably want us[br]to move in together?

00:11:27.70,00:11:30.74
-It doesn't scare me![br]-Yeah, well it scares me!

00:11:30.98,00:11:34.66
I' m not even divorced yet! You just[br]invited me over here for pasta. . .

00:11:34.90,00:11:37.82
. . .and now you' re talking[br]about moving in together.

00:11:38.06,00:11:39.86
And I wasn't even that hungry.

00:11:40.10,00:11:43.86
You know what? It's getting really[br]late, and I should just--

00:11:44.10,00:11:46.86
Don't go! I've scared you![br]I've said too much!

00:11:47.10,00:11:50.02
I' m hopeless and awkward[br]and desperate for love!

00:11:56.86,00:11:58.54
Hey, Janice, it's me.

00:11:59.98,00:12:03.74
I wanted to apologize in advance[br]for having chased you down the street.

00:12:10.66,00:12:12.81
Here you go, honey. This will help.

00:12:13.62,00:12:15.54
So I catch up to her[br]and she says. . .

00:12:15.78,00:12:19.09
. . .this relationship's going too fast[br]and we have to slow down.

00:12:19.30,00:12:20.86
That is never good.

00:12:21.06,00:12:22.34
Then I got all. . .

00:12:23.26,00:12:24.66
. . .needy and clingy.

00:12:25.46,00:12:29.09
Wait a minute. Maybe it's[br]not so bad. How did you leave it?

00:12:29.34,00:12:31.26
She said she'd call me.

00:12:33.46,00:12:34.78
Oh, God.

00:12:35.30,00:12:37.37
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.

00:12:38.62,00:12:40.82
This ice cream tastes like crap,[br]by the way.

00:12:41.02,00:12:44.41
Well, it's that[br]low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.

00:12:44.62,00:12:47.46
We save the real stuff[br]for the truly terminal cases.

00:12:48.22,00:12:51.69
When you' re getting screwed over all[br]the time, you gotta switch to low fat.

00:12:51.94,00:12:53.01
Yeah, you do.

00:12:53.90,00:12:56.42
You don't think I' m terminal?

00:12:56.62,00:13:00.22
Not at all. You' re not terminal.[br]We just need some damage control.

00:13:00.42,00:13:02.22
Okay. Should I call her?

00:13:05.06,00:13:08.45
It's a critical time. If you feel[br]yourself reaching for that phone. . .

00:13:08.70,00:13:11.01
. . .go shopping, get your butt[br]in a bubble bath.

00:13:11.22,00:13:14.69
If you want her back,[br]you have got to start acting aloof.

00:13:14.94,00:13:16.86
She has to know you' re not needy.

00:13:17.06,00:13:18.66
So what you have to do is. . .

00:13:18.90,00:13:21.70
. . .you have to accidentally[br]run into her on purpose. . .

00:13:21.90,00:13:23.66
. . .and then act aloof.

00:13:25.26,00:13:27.22
So I' m not gonna lose her?

00:13:27.94,00:13:30.38
Oh, honey, you' re not a total loser.

00:13:33.82,00:13:35.89
I said, "So I' m not gonna lose her?"

00:13:43.46,00:13:44.45
Guess who's here!

00:13:44.70,00:13:47.54
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!

00:13:47.78,00:13:51.54
Real American hero[br]I'm G.I. Joe!

00:13:51.78,00:13:54.17
Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.

00:13:54.38,00:13:55.70
G.I. Joe?

00:13:55.94,00:13:57.78
You really think he'll fall for that?

00:13:59.02,00:13:59.98
G.I. Joe?

00:14:00.18,00:14:01.30
Cool! Can I play?

00:14:03.90,00:14:07.45
Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects[br]U.S. oil interests overseas!

00:14:07.70,00:14:08.85
Go, Joe!

00:14:12.26,00:14:14.30
-There you are![br]-No, it's not. Sorry.

00:14:14.54,00:14:17.14
But, Phoebe, wait, wait.[br]Phoebe!

00:14:17.38,00:14:20.26
Oh, Joey! Oh, okay![br]See, I didn't recognize you. . .

00:14:20.50,00:14:21.98
. . .in those pants.

00:14:23.82,00:14:26.13
That Tv movie I went in for,[br]did you hear anything?

00:14:26.38,00:14:27.94
I think I got a shot at it.

00:14:28.18,00:14:30.62
Yes, they called![br]You didn't get it!

00:14:31.02,00:14:34.65
Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.[br]I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

00:14:34.90,00:14:37.21
That's okay. These things happen.

00:14:37.46,00:14:40.18
But they shouldn't happen.[br]You know what?

00:14:40.42,00:14:42.42
You' re in a terrible,[br]terrible business.

00:14:43.62,00:14:47.01
I don't want to be the person[br]who makes you look like that.

00:14:47.22,00:14:49.18
I' m okay. See?

00:14:50.90,00:14:53.18
Now you' re sad and creepy.

00:14:53.70,00:14:55.18
I' m sorry. I quit.

00:14:55.90,00:14:59.53
No, no, you can't quit![br]You' re the best agent I ever had.

00:14:59.82,00:15:03.10
Rejection is part of being an actor.[br]You can't take it personal.

00:15:03.34,00:15:07.74
They said they'd never met an ltalian[br]actor with a worse ltalian accent.

00:15:08.30,00:15:09.78
They actually said that?

00:15:09.98,00:15:13.74
Oh, God, there's that face again.[br]See? I can't do this job!

00:15:13.98,00:15:16.02
This is why[br]you have to do this job!

00:15:16.26,00:15:17.41
Agents always lie.

00:15:17.62,00:15:20.46
Estelle just says stuff like,[br]"They went another way. "

00:15:20.70,00:15:22.42
But this? I can use this.

00:15:22.62,00:15:25.34
I can work on a new accent.

00:15:26.30,00:15:29.30
Yeah, okay. If it[br]helps you, okay. Yeah.

00:15:29.54,00:15:31.82
You'll never get me, Joe!

00:15:45.30,00:15:46.58
No, thank you.

00:15:55.30,00:15:56.98
What are you doing here?

00:15:57.62,00:15:59.26
Just a bit of shopping.

00:15:59.50,00:16:00.73
How have you been?

00:16:02.30,00:16:04.26
Are you being British?

00:16:06.46,00:16:07.69
Not anymore.

00:16:08.82,00:16:11.82
Why are you shopping here?[br]You don't live in this neighborhood.

00:16:12.18,00:16:14.46
Were you here waiting for me?

00:16:18.10,00:16:19.01
I' m just. . .

00:16:19.66,00:16:22.22
. . .picking up some things for a party.

00:16:24.10,00:16:25.14
Barley?

00:16:25.94,00:16:27.90
What kind of party serves barley?

00:16:28.14,00:16:31.10
I' m sorry if my friends aren't[br]as sophisticated as yours.

00:16:32.66,00:16:33.89
Where is this party?

00:16:34.14,00:16:34.94
Here in Chelsea.

00:16:35.46,00:16:36.82
Whose party is it?

00:16:37.02,00:16:38.14
A woman's.

00:16:38.38,00:16:39.26
What woman?

00:16:40.70,00:16:41.77
Chelsea.

00:16:43.74,00:16:46.82
Either you' re seeing somebody[br]behind my back. . .

00:16:47.02,00:16:49.58
. . .which would make you[br]the world's biggest jerk. . .

00:16:49.78,00:16:52.01
. . .or you' re pretending[br]to see somebody. . .

00:16:52.26,00:16:55.54
. . .which makes you so pathetic[br]I could cry right here!

00:16:55.78,00:16:59.22
So which of these two guys[br]do you want to be?

00:17:00.22,00:17:01.90
Can I be that guy?

00:17:04.42,00:17:08.62
Okay, we got some more good[br]rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.

00:17:09.62,00:17:10.61
Okay. Shoot.

00:17:10.86,00:17:13.46
Okay. Oh, the zoo commercial.

00:17:13.70,00:17:14.66
I didn't get it?

00:17:14.90,00:17:18.61
They said that you[br]"weren't believable as a human being. "

00:17:19.70,00:17:21.66
So you can work on that.

00:17:22.70,00:17:23.58
Great.

00:17:24.06,00:17:24.97
What else?

00:17:25.18,00:17:28.62
The off-Broadway-play people said[br]that you were "pretty but dumb. "

00:17:29.22,00:17:31.61
Oh, no wait. I' m sorry.[br]That's "pretty dumb. "

00:17:32.30,00:17:34.42
Look, it's okay, no, no, no.[br]Really.

00:17:34.66,00:17:35.65
Look. . .

00:17:36.02,00:17:38.09
. . .I really appreciate this. . .

00:17:38.90,00:17:41.02
. . .but I' m gonna have to[br]go back to Estelle.

00:17:41.90,00:17:44.74
Don't get me wrong.[br]You' re a better agent than she is. . .

00:17:44.98,00:17:48.53
. . .but at least with her, I don't want[br]to blow my pretty dumb brains out.

00:17:49.78,00:17:51.62
Yeah, no, I understand.

00:17:51.82,00:17:53.30
You do? Thanks. Okay.

00:17:53.62,00:17:54.45
Sorry.

00:17:58.26,00:17:59.33
Wait a minute.

00:17:59.58,00:18:00.78
Wait a minute.

00:18:00.98,00:18:04.22
Did you make all that stuff up[br]to get out of being my agent?

00:18:04.46,00:18:05.78
Oh, he caught me.

00:18:08.06,00:18:09.74
I am so busted!

00:18:10.82,00:18:12.97
That's what I suspected!

00:18:16.38,00:18:18.22
And then I just, you know. . .

00:18:19.02,00:18:22.22
. . .threw the bag of barley at her[br]and ran out of the store.

00:18:22.78,00:18:26.41
My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof,"[br]not "a doof. "

00:18:27.98,00:18:30.74
I've actually ruined this, haven't l?

00:18:32.18,00:18:34.18
Is it time for the good ice cream now?

00:18:34.86,00:18:36.18
Yeah, it is.

00:18:36.78,00:18:39.86
You know what?[br]Everything's gonna be okay.

00:18:46.58,00:18:48.62
Can you hold on for a second?

00:18:50.18,00:18:51.22
What do I do?

00:18:51.42,00:18:53.26
I don't know.[br]This is unprecedented.

00:18:53.50,00:18:55.97
If we did what you did,[br]a man would never call.

00:18:56.86,00:19:00.22
I got it! Pretend you just woke up.[br]That'll throw her off!

00:19:00.42,00:19:02.46
-Be sleepy![br]-Yes! And grumpy!

00:19:02.70,00:19:05.22
What are you--?[br]Stop naming dwarfs!

00:19:10.30,00:19:12.82
I' m so glad that you called.

00:19:13.98,00:19:18.22
I know I've been acting[br]really weird lately. . .

00:19:19.50,00:19:22.42
. . .and it's just because[br]I' m crazy about you. . .

00:19:25.10,00:19:29.06
. . .and I just got stupid and scared. . .

00:19:29.30,00:19:31.02
. . .and stupid a couple more times.

00:19:32.30,00:19:33.21
And I' m sorry.

00:19:34.70,00:19:35.50
Really?

00:19:37.66,00:19:38.70
Really?

00:19:39.74,00:19:41.86
He's so lucky.[br]If Janice were a guy. . .

00:19:42.10,00:19:44.82
. . .she'd be sleeping[br]with somebody else by now.

00:19:46.06,00:19:47.26
I love you too.

00:19:47.78,00:19:49.10
It's so unfair!

00:19:56.90,00:19:58.42
G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?!

00:19:59.02,00:20:02.86
I don't know what to tell you guys.[br]That's the doll he chose.

00:20:03.26,00:20:05.54
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?

00:20:05.74,00:20:07.94
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.

00:20:08.18,00:20:11.46
And if you guys can't deal with it,[br]that's just your too bad.

00:20:13.34,00:20:17.13
What are you being such a weenie for?[br]So he has a Barbie. Big deal.

00:20:17.38,00:20:19.34
You used to dress up like a woman.

00:20:25.18,00:20:26.06
What?

00:20:27.02,00:20:29.25
The way you used to dress up[br]in Mom's clothes?

00:20:29.66,00:20:31.30
What are you talking about?

00:20:31.50,00:20:34.34
The big hat, the pearls,[br]the little pink handbag?

00:20:34.58,00:20:37.02
Okay. You are totally[br]making this up.

00:20:37.50,00:20:39.26
How can you not remember?

00:20:39.50,00:20:41.22
You made us call you "Bea"?

00:20:47.62,00:20:48.66
Oh, God.

00:20:49.82,00:20:52.70
I've literally never been this happy.

00:20:53.38,00:20:55.42
Wasn't there a little song?

00:20:55.62,00:20:57.62
Oh, please, God,[br]let there be a song.

00:20:58.14,00:21:00.21
There was no song.[br]There was no song.

00:21:00.42,00:21:01.74
I am Bea

00:21:02.22,00:21:03.82
-I drink tea--[br]-That's enough.

00:21:04.06,00:21:05.42
Won't you....

00:21:06.50,00:21:07.78
Won't you....

00:21:08.78,00:21:10.01
Won't you....

00:21:11.58,00:21:13.94
Won't you dance around with me?

00:21:20.46,00:21:22.77
I am Bea

00:21:23.30,00:21:25.37
I drink tea

00:21:25.98,00:21:30.46
Won't you dance around with--?

00:21:40.10,00:21:41.33
Ross?

00:00:08.62,00:00:11.50
So what happened?[br]Did a forest tick you off?

00:00:13.86,00:00:16.62
We always say[br]we need a place for the mail.

00:00:22.10,00:00:27.02
I started building one. But then[br]I decided to take it to the next step.

00:00:28.10,00:00:30.09
You' re building a post office?

00:00:31.34,00:00:34.34
No, an entertainment unit,[br]with a built-in mail cubby.

00:00:34.70,00:00:37.01
It's a one-day job, max.

00:00:38.70,00:00:41.17
My word, those are snug!

00:00:43.70,00:00:45.22
These are my old work pants.

00:00:45.46,00:00:47.58
Sergio valente.

00:00:56.78,00:00:59.22
Power saw kind of got away[br]from me there.

00:01:00.82,00:01:02.89

00:01:49.98,00:01:52.21
Hey, Pheebs.[br]Any sign of your brother?

00:01:52.42,00:01:54.33
No, but he's always late.

00:01:54.58,00:01:56.86
-I thought you only met him once.[br]-I did.

00:01:58.46,00:02:01.77
I think it sounds big sister-y,[br]"Frank's always late. "

00:02:02.70,00:02:04.82
Well, relax. He'll be here.

00:02:05.06,00:02:06.42
I know.[br]I' m just nervous.

00:02:06.98,00:02:10.06
It's just, Mom's dead,[br]don't talk to my sister. . .

00:02:10.30,00:02:12.82
. . .Grandma's been sleeping[br]a lot lately.

00:02:13.46,00:02:17.30
It's just the "Iast-desperate-[br]chance-to-have-a-family" kind of thing.

00:02:17.54,00:02:19.02
You' re sweet to wait with me.

00:02:19.26,00:02:23.02
Actually, Gunther sent me. You' re not[br]allowed to have cups out here.

00:02:25.98,00:02:28.37
Does anyone else think[br]David Copperfield's cute?

00:02:30.50,00:02:33.50
No. But he told me he thinks[br]you' re a fox.

00:02:35.26,00:02:36.82
All right. Janice likes him.

00:02:37.06,00:02:40.82
In fact, she likes him so much,[br]she put him on her "freebie" Iist.

00:02:44.30,00:02:45.13
Her what?

00:02:45.38,00:02:50.01
We have a deal where we each pick five[br]celebrities we could sleep with. . .

00:02:51.10,00:02:53.17
. . .and the other one can't get mad.

00:02:53.38,00:02:56.38
The heart of every[br]healthy relationship:

00:02:56.58,00:02:59.86
Honesty, respect[br]and sex with celebrities.

00:03:00.50,00:03:01.94
So who's on your list?

00:03:02.18,00:03:03.41
Kim Basinger. . .

00:03:03.66,00:03:06.02
. . .Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry. . .

00:03:06.26,00:03:07.66
. . .Yasmine Bleeth. . .

00:03:08.98,00:03:10.81
. . .and Jessica Rabbit.

00:03:12.62,00:03:16.62
You do realize that she is a cartoon,[br]and way out of your league?

00:03:16.98,00:03:20.82
I know. I just wonder if I could[br]get her eyes to pop out of her head.

00:03:22.38,00:03:23.86
Who would yours be?

00:03:24.10,00:03:26.70
First, I need a boyfriend.[br]Then I can have a list.

00:03:27.62,00:03:29.42
It's just a game, Mon.

00:03:31.30,00:03:32.66
Rach, how about you?

00:03:32.90,00:03:36.86
I don't know. I guess Chris[br]O' Donnell, John F. Kennedy Jr. . .

00:03:37.10,00:03:40.41
. . .Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting[br]and Parker Stevenson.

00:03:42.30,00:03:43.86
Spiderman?

00:03:44.10,00:03:45.30
Hardy Boy.

00:03:46.30,00:03:48.50
-Peter Parker.[br]-Thank you.

00:03:49.66,00:03:52.10
What about you, honey?[br]Who'd be on your list?

00:03:52.30,00:03:55.38
That kind of thing[br]requires some serious thought.

00:03:55.58,00:03:59.13
First, I'd divide my prospective[br]candidates into categories.

00:03:59.70,00:04:00.77
What a geek!

00:04:02.66,00:04:05.46
Everybody, this is Frank![br]My half brother, Frank!

00:04:05.70,00:04:07.02
This is everybody.

00:04:07.22,00:04:08.90
-This is Ross.[br]-How are you?

00:04:13.62,00:04:14.77
This is Monica.

00:04:17.46,00:04:19.02
And this is Rachel.

00:04:22.70,00:04:24.14
I' m gonna get coffee for us.

00:04:24.38,00:04:26.82
Hey, how do you guys get[br]anything done?

00:04:27.42,00:04:28.90
We don't, really.

00:04:30.58,00:04:32.26
Do you guys have big plans?

00:04:32.50,00:04:36.21
Oh, yeah. We' re gonna connect[br]and bond and everything.

00:04:36.42,00:04:40.94
I thought we could go down to Times[br]Square and pick up some ninja stars.

00:04:41.18,00:04:45.02
My friend, Larry, he wants me[br]to take a picture of a hooker.

00:04:46.62,00:04:49.42
We really don't take advantage[br]of living in the city.

00:05:03.30,00:05:05.21
Oh, sorry. Did I get you?

00:05:06.62,00:05:07.82
No, you didn't "get" me!

00:05:08.06,00:05:09.21
It's an electric drill!

00:05:09.42,00:05:11.22
You "get" me, you kill me!

00:05:12.30,00:05:14.45
Calm down![br]Do you want this unit or not?

00:05:14.90,00:05:17.05
I do not want this unit!

00:05:17.30,00:05:20.18
You should've told me before.[br]I' m not a mind reader.

00:05:21.90,00:05:24.82
And we' re out of beer.[br]I' m going to Monica's.

00:05:25.46,00:05:26.45
Fine!

00:05:33.66,00:05:36.22
Where you heading in those pants?[br]1 982?

00:05:37.70,00:05:42.17
I saw down at the hardware store, they[br]got those designer tiles on sale. . .

00:05:42.38,00:05:44.61
. . .if you wanna redo[br]your bathroom floor.

00:05:45.06,00:05:47.02
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?

00:05:47.22,00:05:49.98
Nothing. It's just old and dingy,[br]that's all.

00:05:50.90,00:05:52.34
I highly doubt that.

00:05:54.22,00:05:56.66
If you move your hamper. . .

00:05:56.90,00:05:58.70
. . .you see how[br]the tile used to be.

00:06:02.22,00:06:04.86
I can't live like this![br]What are we gonna do?

00:06:05.10,00:06:06.46
Relax. Here, hold this.

00:06:06.70,00:06:09.42
This old stuff comes right up.[br]I'll show you.

00:06:11.90,00:06:14.02
A little more than I wanted to see.

00:06:16.98,00:06:19.82
Look at that![br]Every inch of this is glued down!

00:06:20.02,00:06:23.41
It'd take forever to pry this up.[br]You should just leave it.

00:06:25.26,00:06:29.62
I can't leave it! You gouged[br]a hole in my dingy floor!

00:06:37.90,00:06:39.62
There. There you go.

00:06:40.74,00:06:41.86
Yeah, that's nice.

00:06:42.10,00:06:45.62
We can put it back there after the[br]surgeons remove it from your colon!

00:06:55.02,00:06:58.22
I know what I wanted to ask you.[br]Can you roll your tongue?

00:06:59.18,00:07:01.74
Because I can and my mom couldn't.

00:07:01.98,00:07:05.50
And I figured that was[br]something I got from our dad.

00:07:05.74,00:07:08.02
Well, wait, you mean like this?

00:07:09.14,00:07:11.21
Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

00:07:12.46,00:07:13.61
You' re not doing it.

00:07:14.06,00:07:17.21
Oh, right. Okay.[br]Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

00:07:18.62,00:07:20.34
We don't have that.

00:07:25.90,00:07:27.02
When's your birthday?

00:07:27.26,00:07:28.58
February 1 6th.

00:07:29.02,00:07:31.09
I know a guy who's the 1 8th.

00:07:33.06,00:07:34.34
That's close.

00:07:36.10,00:07:37.09
When's yours?

00:07:37.34,00:07:38.98
October 25th.

00:07:43.26,00:07:45.62
That's the same month as Halloween.

00:07:49.78,00:07:52.74
So what kind of things[br]do you like to do at home?

00:07:53.70,00:07:54.93
Melt stuff.

00:07:59.26,00:08:02.70
-Okay, I've got three of my five.[br]-Three of your five what?

00:08:03.26,00:08:05.65
Celebrities I' m allowed to sleep with.

00:08:06.18,00:08:08.25
God, you' re giving this[br]a lot of thought.

00:08:08.50,00:08:11.02
Hey, it's hard, okay?[br]I only have two spots left.

00:08:11.22,00:08:14.26
All right. Who you got it[br]narrowed down to?

00:08:14.46,00:08:15.37
Elizabeth Hurley.

00:08:16.42,00:08:17.46
very attractive.

00:08:17.70,00:08:18.85
Forgiving.

00:08:21.42,00:08:23.02
Susan Sarandon.

00:08:24.62,00:08:26.61
You know what? She's too political.

00:08:26.82,00:08:30.10
She'd probably make you donate[br]four cans of food first.

00:08:32.66,00:08:35.22
And lsabella Rossellini.

00:08:35.42,00:08:36.62
very hot. very sexy.

00:08:36.86,00:08:41.41
But she's too international.[br]She's never gonna be around.

00:08:41.90,00:08:44.05
-So?[br]-So you gotta play the odds.

00:08:44.30,00:08:47.42
Pick somebody who's gonna be[br]in the country all the time.

00:08:47.90,00:08:51.53
Yeah. Because that's why you won't[br]get lsabella Rossellini. Geography.

00:09:02.02,00:09:04.74
Okay. So by "melting"[br]you meant melting.

00:09:07.30,00:09:08.50
So is it, like, art?

00:09:08.70,00:09:10.34
Yeah, you can melt art.

00:09:12.38,00:09:14.10
Hey, can I use your phone?

00:09:15.10,00:09:18.78
-Sure. You want to call your mom?[br]-No, I want to melt it.

00:09:19.82,00:09:22.42
Oh. Well, not right now.

00:09:28.18,00:09:32.10
I' m gonna go to bed. The fumes[br]are giving me a headache. So. . . .

00:09:36.62,00:09:38.85
Good night, "bro. "

00:09:39.38,00:09:40.53
Good night.

00:09:44.82,00:09:45.89
Here.

00:09:46.58,00:09:47.86
Just in case.

00:09:48.62,00:09:50.22
Oh, excellent!

00:10:02.70,00:10:05.58
-What kind of karate is that?[br]-No kind.

00:10:07.38,00:10:09.06
He just makes it up.

00:10:09.74,00:10:13.34
-How's it going with you guys?[br]-So far it kind of blows.

00:10:17.26,00:10:20.62
I don't know, I just thought[br]he'd feel more like a brother.

00:10:20.82,00:10:23.05
Like you and Ross.[br]Close and connected and. . . .

00:10:23.30,00:10:25.74
We' re close now.[br]You wouldn't believe the years. . .

00:10:25.98,00:10:30.58
. . .of noogies, and wedgies, and flying[br]wedgies, and atomic wedgies and. . . .

00:10:32.06,00:10:34.62
That's when the waistband[br]goes over your head.

00:10:37.54,00:10:39.69
We drove each other crazy[br]playing the shadow game.

00:10:39.98,00:10:42.66
-How do you play the shadow game?[br]-How do you play the shadow game?

00:10:42.90,00:10:44.94
-I just asked you.[br]-I just asked you.

00:10:45.18,00:10:47.01
I don't have time for this.

00:10:47.34,00:10:50.81
-That is what the game is.[br]-You just gave up really quickly.

00:10:53.46,00:10:55.02
-Seen Joey?[br]-What's the matter?

00:10:55.22,00:10:57.13
Oh, just this!

00:11:02.30,00:11:06.62
It's my fault, really, because the[br]couch is where we keep the varnish.

00:11:08.58,00:11:10.78
Somebody wanna hand me[br]one of those tiles?

00:11:13.18,00:11:15.74
-What's going on?[br]-He's retiling my floor.

00:11:16.90,00:11:18.18
Spackle boy!

00:11:19.50,00:11:22.38
-Get up![br]-You started this, you'll finish it!

00:11:22.82,00:11:24.26
He started mine first!

00:11:24.50,00:11:27.26
Build the unit, Cinderellie[br]Lay the tile, Cinderellie

00:11:32.38,00:11:34.06
Big octopus.

00:11:42.46,00:11:44.74
Oh, my God! I totally forgot!

00:11:45.38,00:11:47.29
Well, can't someone else do it?

00:11:47.86,00:11:49.34
But I have company.

00:11:52.78,00:11:55.22
Look, that's all right.[br]I'll come in.

00:11:56.46,00:11:58.82
I' m sorry,[br]but I have to go into work.

00:11:59.02,00:12:02.41
It's one of my regulars who's[br]insisting that I do him, so. . . .

00:12:02.66,00:12:04.89
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

00:12:05.46,00:12:06.45
I' m a masseuse.

00:12:06.70,00:12:08.66
I give people massages and stuff.

00:12:08.90,00:12:12.50
You work at one of[br]those massage parlors?

00:12:13.58,00:12:16.73
Well, you know, we don't call it that.[br]But, yeah.

00:12:19.90,00:12:21.86
That's wild.

00:12:22.10,00:12:23.93
No, I had no idea.

00:12:24.18,00:12:25.33
Alrighty.

00:12:26.90,00:12:28.42
I'll be back in a little bit.

00:12:28.62,00:12:30.42
Unless you want to come with me.

00:12:30.66,00:12:32.46
You mean, like, watch?

00:12:33.42,00:12:37.34
No. No, you can get one yourself.[br]It'll be on the house.

00:12:37.58,00:12:39.49
What are big sisters for?

00:12:39.98,00:12:42.62
Well, I don't think this. You know?

00:12:43.02,00:12:45.01
No. No, no.[br]I wouldn't do you myself.

00:12:45.22,00:12:46.94
I mean, that would be weird.

00:12:48.38,00:12:50.58
I'll get one of the[br]other girls to do it.

00:12:50.78,00:12:52.34
This is so much fun!

00:12:54.18,00:12:55.62
Are you excited?

00:12:57.98,00:13:00.50
Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?

00:13:02.94,00:13:04.62
It's beautiful!

00:13:04.90,00:13:07.82
It's like the first bathroom[br]floor there ever was!

00:13:10.10,00:13:12.22
What are you going in there for?

00:13:12.46,00:13:14.37
You want, like, a number?

00:13:18.46,00:13:20.02
Hi. Bye.

00:13:21.50,00:13:24.02
Okay. I' m done with my choices.

00:13:24.22,00:13:25.82
These are final.

00:13:27.50,00:13:30.26
-Well, it's about time.[br]-Yeah. very official.

00:13:30.50,00:13:34.62
Oh, yeah. Well, you know, Chandler[br]printed it up on his computer.

00:13:34.86,00:13:36.14
And who laminated it?

00:13:38.10,00:13:39.46
That was me.

00:13:40.26,00:13:41.49
All right, let me see.

00:13:42.42,00:13:46.05
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder,[br]Elizabeth Hurley. . .

00:13:46.30,00:13:47.58
. . .Michelle Pfeiffer. . .

00:13:48.62,00:13:50.30
. . .Dorothy Hamill"?

00:13:55.78,00:13:57.14
Hey, it's my list!

00:13:58.34,00:14:01.81
You do realize she only spins[br]like that on ice?

00:14:10.70,00:14:13.06
-What's going on?[br]-She broke my arm!

00:14:13.30,00:14:15.82
-He touched my fanny.[br]-She touched mine first!

00:14:16.02,00:14:17.46
That's my job!

00:14:17.70,00:14:21.14
So what's the deal? I can have sex[br]with you but I can't touch you?

00:14:22.94,00:14:26.09
-You can't have sex with her![br]-Did you think I was a hooker?

00:14:26.34,00:14:29.65
No, okay. I know. You' re a masseuse.[br]It's cool. I' m not a cop!

00:14:32.90,00:14:35.82
Ask Mr. Wiffler if he[br]can wait for five minutes.

00:14:36.02,00:14:37.42
Fine.

00:14:37.62,00:14:38.98
I don't like you.

00:14:40.90,00:14:43.90
So that's what you thought I did?[br]God!

00:14:44.98,00:14:46.66
That's not what I do!

00:14:47.10,00:14:49.94
Wait, that's not what you do?

00:14:50.18,00:14:51.33
No!

00:14:52.18,00:14:53.70
Why would you think that?

00:14:53.90,00:14:57.10
I don't know. This is the city,[br]you know? I just. . . .

00:14:57.34,00:14:58.54
I mean. . .

00:14:58.78,00:15:00.10
. . .I don't know.

00:15:01.62,00:15:05.33
Whatever. It's the perfect end[br]to the perfect weekend anyway.

00:15:06.66,00:15:07.73
Oh, wait.

00:15:07.98,00:15:10.62
No, you' re right.[br]No, it was perfect.

00:15:11.70,00:15:14.09
I can't believe[br]I screwed it up so bad.

00:15:15.90,00:15:17.34
You thought it was perfect?

00:15:17.58,00:15:19.65
Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect. . .

00:15:19.90,00:15:22.26
. . .but you know, it was pretty cool,[br]you know?

00:15:22.50,00:15:25.02
Because we had all those[br]great talks, you know?

00:15:29.70,00:15:32.34
Which ones in particular[br]were great for you?

00:15:33.26,00:15:35.82
Well, you know, about[br]the tongue thing, you know?

00:15:36.02,00:15:39.49
And how I told you about[br]my likes and my dislikes.

00:15:41.10,00:15:44.70
How I like to melt stuff, and how[br]I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.

00:15:46.98,00:15:48.34
Right. Okay.

00:15:49.30,00:15:54.22
I feel like I can really talk to you[br]because you' re my sister, you know?

00:15:56.66,00:15:59.10
Yeah. I guess I do.

00:15:59.34,00:16:01.98
And then I go feel your friend up[br]and make you mad at me.

00:16:04.26,00:16:07.14
Well, I wasn't hopping mad,[br]you know?

00:16:08.10,00:16:09.78
You hopped a little bit.

00:16:12.06,00:16:15.18
Yeah, I' m really sorry.[br]You know, I' m really. . . .

00:16:16.10,00:16:17.22
Okay.

00:16:19.50,00:16:23.02
Well, this is my favorite part[br]of the weekend. Right now. This.

00:16:23.22,00:16:24.29
This?

00:16:25.10,00:16:27.41
Oh, come on. We went to Times Square.

00:16:27.66,00:16:30.62
We found ninja stars. I almost[br]get my arm broken by a hooker--

00:16:30.82,00:16:32.22
She's not a hooker.

00:16:32.70,00:16:34.90
When I tell my friends about her,[br]she will be.

00:16:41.98,00:16:42.89
On 3!

00:16:43.10,00:16:44.90
1 , 2--

00:16:45.14,00:16:46.70
Why don't we just go on 2?

00:16:46.90,00:16:47.81
Why 2?

00:16:48.02,00:16:49.42
Because it's faster.

00:16:49.62,00:16:52.77
I could've counted to 3 four times[br]without all the "2" talk.

00:16:53.18,00:16:57.46
-All right, but in the future--[br]-Heavy thing! Not getting lighter!

00:16:58.38,00:16:59.78
1 , 2--

00:16:59.98,00:17:02.02
So we are going with two?

00:17:10.86,00:17:12.38
A good job, Joe.

00:17:13.62,00:17:14.58
Wow.

00:17:15.30,00:17:16.26
It's big.

00:17:18.18,00:17:20.82
So big it actually makes[br]our doors look smaller.

00:17:21.74,00:17:23.02
Maybe my ruler's wrong.

00:17:23.22,00:17:25.61
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.

00:17:26.30,00:17:30.62
It's not that bad. So it blocks a[br]little of your door, a little of mine.

00:17:30.82,00:17:31.81
I got a better idea.

00:17:32.06,00:17:35.45
How about it blocks none of my door,[br]and a lot of your door?

00:17:38.58,00:17:41.73
Listen, before I forget,[br]that side is still wet.

00:17:46.06,00:17:48.05
Let me just see[br]if I've got this right.

00:17:48.30,00:17:51.61
So this is a half-caf, double-tall,[br]easy hazelnut. . .

00:17:51.82,00:17:56.58
. . .nonfat, no foam, with whip,[br]extra-hot latte, right?

00:17:56.78,00:17:58.18
Okay. Great.

00:17:58.86,00:18:00.46
You freak.

00:18:06.22,00:18:07.18
Thank you.

00:18:07.42,00:18:09.06
A coffee to go, please.

00:18:13.10,00:18:14.42
Isabella Rossellini!

00:18:14.66,00:18:17.18
Are you serious? Oh, my God!

00:18:17.38,00:18:20.69
Damn! I cannot believe[br]I took her off my list!

00:18:20.94,00:18:23.78
Why? Because otherwise[br]you'd go for it?

00:18:25.70,00:18:27.38
Yeah, maybe.

00:18:27.82,00:18:29.14
You lie.

00:18:29.90,00:18:31.66
You don't think I'd go up to her?

00:18:31.90,00:18:35.45
It took you 1 0 years to finally admit[br]you liked me.

00:18:37.42,00:18:42.34
Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad[br]that list is laminated.

00:18:42.86,00:18:46.90
You know what, honey? You go ahead.[br]We'll call her an alternate.

00:18:48.90,00:18:50.05
Hold my cruller.

00:18:52.46,00:18:54.29
Are you really gonna[br]let him do this?

00:18:54.54,00:18:56.61
He's about to go hit[br]on lsabella Rossellini.

00:18:56.86,00:18:59.17
I' m just sorry we don't got popcorn.

00:19:04.62,00:19:05.94
I' m Ross.

00:19:06.26,00:19:09.70
You don't know me,[br]but I' m a big, big fan of yours.

00:19:09.94,00:19:10.98
I mean. . .

00:19:11.50,00:19:12.54
...Blue Velvet.

00:19:15.90,00:19:19.42
I was wondering if I could maybe[br]buy you a cup of coffee.

00:19:19.66,00:19:22.05
Or reimburse you for that one.

00:19:24.02,00:19:26.14
Aren't you with that girl over there?

00:19:30.50,00:19:32.02
Well, yeah, kind of.

00:19:32.22,00:19:34.21
But that's okay.[br]We have an understanding.

00:19:35.06,00:19:39.66
We each have this list of five famous[br]people, and you were one of mine.

00:19:39.90,00:19:42.02
So I' m allowed to sleep with you.

00:19:43.70,00:19:44.90
It's flattering.

00:19:47.82,00:19:48.62
I don't know--

00:19:48.86,00:19:51.09
Wait. Wait, lsabella.

00:19:51.90,00:19:56.22
Don't dismiss this so fast. This is[br]a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:19:56.42,00:19:57.38
Yeah, for you.

00:19:59.78,00:20:00.82
Is that the list?

00:20:01.06,00:20:02.46
-Yes.[br]-Can I see it?

00:20:03.30,00:20:05.13
-Come on.[br]-But-- Okay.

00:20:06.22,00:20:07.34
I' m not on the list!

00:20:07.58,00:20:10.02
But that's not the final draft.

00:20:10.58,00:20:11.94
It's laminated.

00:20:14.26,00:20:16.82
Okay, see, you were on my list.

00:20:17.02,00:20:18.70
But then my friend, Chandler. . .

00:20:22.10,00:20:25.02
. . .brought up the point[br]that you are international.

00:20:25.22,00:20:28.06
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.[br]Local.

00:20:28.90,00:20:32.13
You know, it's ironic,[br]because I have a list. . .

00:20:32.38,00:20:35.06
. . .of five goofy coffeehouse guys.

00:20:35.30,00:20:39.90
And yesterday, I just bumped you[br]for that guy over there.

00:20:47.02,00:20:48.54
We' re just gonna be friends.

00:20:54.06,00:20:55.29
You know what?

00:20:56.42,00:20:57.86
Bet you I could fit in there.

00:21:00.34,00:21:02.54
I got five bucks says you can't.

00:21:03.98,00:21:05.94
Get out your checkbook, mister.

00:21:06.82,00:21:09.05
Oh, I think I have the cash.

00:21:14.38,00:21:16.34
You are dog, man!

00:21:17.06,00:21:18.38
I totally fit!

00:21:19.26,00:21:20.98
Yeah. You got me.

00:21:21.50,00:21:23.89
I' m out five big ones.

00:21:27.10,00:21:28.38
There you go.

00:21:29.06,00:21:30.26
Thank you.

00:21:34.10,00:21:36.38
Oh, well, hello, Mr. Lincoln!

00:21:37.38,00:21:39.61
Better luck next time, buddy!

00:21:40.02,00:21:42.78
And the drinks are on me!

00:00:03.01,00:00:06.69
Janice has a question.[br]Who of the six of you. . .

00:00:06.93,00:00:10.53
. . .has slept with[br]who of the six of you?

00:00:11.65,00:00:13.88
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

00:00:15.09,00:00:18.21
I'm sorry, the answer there[br]would be none of us.

00:00:18.45,00:00:21.89
Over the years, none of you[br]ever got drunk and stupid?

00:00:22.13,00:00:24.60
Well, that's really[br]a different question.

00:00:25.45,00:00:29.84
I can't believe a group of people[br]who spends this much time together. . .

00:00:30.09,00:00:32.00
. . .has never bumped uglies.

00:00:33.57,00:00:36.45
There was that one time[br]Monica and Rachel got together.

00:00:37.29,00:00:38.28
What?

00:00:38.81,00:00:41.01
Excuse me, there was no "time. "

00:00:41.21,00:00:43.60
Okay, but let's say there was.

00:00:44.01,00:00:45.49
How might that go?

00:00:48.21,00:00:49.72
Well then answer me this:

00:00:49.97,00:00:53.81
Have any of you ever almost. . .?

00:00:56.85,00:01:00.21
-Anybody need more coffee?[br]-Hey, there's a dog out there!

00:01:00.97,00:01:03.04
The One With the Flashback

Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:01:49.97,00:01:52.41
-That is so unfortunate.[br]-What?

00:01:52.65,00:01:55.17
Cute Naked Guy's[br]starting to put on weight.

00:01:56.77,00:01:58.60
I'll be back in just a minute.

00:01:58.85,00:02:03.00
I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks[br]on the phone.

00:02:03.21,00:02:05.60
You didn't leave lipstick marks[br]on the phone.

00:02:05.85,00:02:08.49
Then it must have been you. Bye.

00:02:09.65,00:02:10.56
Bye-bye.

00:02:12.05,00:02:14.69
-That's why I moved out.[br]-Hey, while we're on that. . .

00:02:14.93,00:02:18.37
. . .when are you gonna tell my sister[br]you don't live here anymore?

00:02:18.89,00:02:20.72
On some level, she already knows.

00:02:20.97,00:02:23.33
She doesn't know you sneak out[br]every night. . .

00:02:23.57,00:02:25.21
. . .and back every morning. . .

00:02:25.41,00:02:28.53
. . .and that you've been[br]at your grandmother's for a week.

00:02:28.77,00:02:31.00
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

00:02:36.21,00:02:38.81
I'm never gonna find a roommate.[br]Ever.

00:02:39.01,00:02:39.92
Nobody good?

00:02:40.17,00:02:42.64
There was the guy with the ferrets.

00:02:42.85,00:02:43.68
That's plural.

00:02:45.25,00:02:48.45
The spitter. And the guy[br]who enjoyed my name so much. . .

00:02:48.69,00:02:51.21
. . .he made a noise[br]every time he said it.

00:02:51.41,00:02:54.01
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.[br]Bing! "

00:02:54.37,00:02:57.44
"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.[br]Bing! "

00:02:57.69,00:02:59.52
-How many more tomorrow?[br]-Two.

00:02:59.77,00:03:01.92
This photographer[br]who seemed really dull. . .

00:03:02.17,00:03:04.84
. . .and this actor guy[br]who I'm not sure about.

00:03:05.09,00:03:07.45
When I answered[br]the phone "Chandler Bing" . . .

00:03:07.65,00:03:09.96
. . .he said, "Whoa! Short message! "

00:03:12.89,00:03:15.20
Foot on the floor[br]or come over no more:

00:03:16.45,00:03:19.12
Your dresser is missing,[br]but this she notices.

00:03:19.69,00:03:21.44
-What?[br]-I have to go.

00:03:24.09,00:03:26.45
Carol should be home by now, so. . . .

00:03:26.69,00:03:29.21
-How's it going with you guys?[br]-Better, actually.

00:03:29.41,00:03:32.40
I finally figured out why we're[br]having so much trouble.

00:03:32.61,00:03:35.05
-Oh, really?[br]-Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

00:03:35.29,00:03:38.20
She doesn't have any close[br]friends that are just hers.

00:03:38.41,00:03:42.40
But last week, she met this woman[br]at the gym, "Susan" something.

00:03:42.77,00:03:47.13
And they really hit it off, and[br]I think it's gonna make a difference.

00:03:50.01,00:03:51.21
So, Eric. . .

00:03:51.41,00:03:53.45
. . .what kind of photography do you do?

00:03:53.65,00:03:55.08
Oh, mostly fashion.

00:03:55.33,00:03:58.05
There may be models here sometimes.[br]I hope that's cool.

00:04:00.25,00:04:01.65
Yes, that is cool.

00:04:02.29,00:04:04.65
Because I have models here,[br]you know. . .

00:04:05.89,00:04:07.69
: : :never:

00:04:08.69,00:04:12.73
During the summer I spend most[br]weekends at my sister's beach house. . .

00:04:12.93,00:04:14.68
. . .which you're welcome to use.

00:04:14.93,00:04:18.00
Although I should tell you,[br]she's a porn star.

00:04:20.65,00:04:23.40
Well, I still have[br]one more person to meet.

00:04:23.65,00:04:26.40
But unless it turns out[br]to be your sister. . .

00:04:27.01,00:04:29.16
. . .I think your chances[br]are pretty good.

00:04:29.89,00:04:31.01
All right.

00:04:35.21,00:04:37.01
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

00:04:37.21,00:04:40.89
This here is the kitchen,[br]and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

00:04:41.69,00:04:43.97
Don't you wanna ask me[br]any questions?

00:04:46.29,00:04:47.41
Sure.

00:04:49.29,00:04:50.52
What's up?

00:04:51.65,00:04:53.80
Well, I'm an actor.

00:04:54.29,00:04:55.49
I'm fairly neat.

00:04:56.57,00:04:58.24
I got my own Tv.

00:04:58.45,00:05:02.00
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally[br]okay with the gay thing.

00:05:04.77,00:05:05.84
What gay thing?

00:05:06.81,00:05:11.65
Just, you know, in general.[br]The whole "people-being-gay" thing.

00:05:12.97,00:05:14.37
Totally cool with that.

00:05:17.97,00:05:20.41
Okay, Jerry.[br]Thanks for stopping by.

00:05:28.29,00:05:29.28
Oh, my God!

00:05:37.69,00:05:38.73
Hey, Mon.

00:05:39.69,00:05:42.81
-Wanna hear something that sucks?[br]-Do I ever!

00:05:44.09,00:05:46.65
-Chris says they're closing the bar.[br]-No way!

00:05:46.89,00:05:49.01
They're turning it into[br]a coffee place.

00:05:49.21,00:05:50.61
Just coffee?

00:05:51.25,00:05:53.81
-Where are we gonna hang out?[br]-You got me.

00:05:54.01,00:05:56.48
-Can I get a beer?[br]-Did you pick a roommate?

00:05:56.69,00:05:58.57
-You bet.[br]-Is it the ltalian guy?

00:05:59.09,00:05:59.89
Yeah, right.

00:06:01.65,00:06:02.45
He's so cute.

00:06:02.69,00:06:05.33
That's what I want.[br]A roommate I can walk around with. . .

00:06:05.57,00:06:07.80
. . .and be referred to[br]as "the funny one. "

00:06:08.37,00:06:10.60
Table's free. Rack them up.[br]Back in a minute.

00:06:10.81,00:06:13.01
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

00:06:13.21,00:06:16.01
Okay, but after that,[br]we're shooting some pool.

00:06:18.69,00:06:21.08
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

00:06:22.25,00:06:24.45
My friend ordered an onion. . .

00:06:24.69,00:06:26.41
. . .not an olive.

00:06:26.61,00:06:29.41
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke. . .

00:06:29.61,00:06:31.73
. . .which I don't think this is.

00:06:32.09,00:06:34.08
-I am so sorry.[br]-That's all right.

00:06:35.45,00:06:38.36
How hard is it to get a couple[br]drinks right, huh?

00:06:42.09,00:06:44.00
I would like to propose a toast. . .

00:06:44.69,00:06:47.65
. . .to the woman who, in one year[br]from today, will become. . .

00:06:47.89,00:06:50.88
. . .Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S.

00:06:51.61,00:06:54.41
I think it's time[br]to see the ring again.

00:06:58.29,00:07:03.05
Isn't it exciting? I mean,[br]it's like having a boyfriend for life!

00:07:05.81,00:07:07.93
Yeah. I know.

00:07:08.81,00:07:09.80
What?

00:07:10.05,00:07:11.96
Oh, I don't know.

00:07:12.69,00:07:15.57
Well, maybe it's just the idea. . .

00:07:15.81,00:07:18.25
. . .of Barry for the rest of my life.

00:07:18.45,00:07:19.80
I don't know, I think l. . . .

00:07:20.05,00:07:21.93
I feel like having[br]one last fling. . .

00:07:22.17,00:07:25.00
. . .just to sort of get it[br]out of my system.

00:07:27.17,00:07:29.64
-Rachel, stop![br]-You're so bad!

00:07:29.89,00:07:33.52
I'm serious. I really think[br]I need to just have. . .

00:07:33.77,00:07:35.81
. . .some meaningless sex,[br]you know?

00:07:36.01,00:07:38.65
With the next guy I see.

00:07:44.65,00:07:48.01
Excuse me, I seem to have[br]dropped my ball.

00:07:49.97,00:07:50.96
Yeah, so?

00:07:53.57,00:07:55.80
And now I've picked it up again.

00:07:59.01,00:08:01.65
My God![br]I went to high school with her.

00:08:06.81,00:08:09.20
Look! Hi! What do you think?

00:08:09.45,00:08:10.65
Oh, my God!

00:08:10.89,00:08:13.41
You can't even see[br]where the Titanic hit it.

00:08:14.01,00:08:17.37
Yes, his name is Barry.[br]He's a doctor, thank you very much.

00:08:17.57,00:08:20.04
Just like you always wanted.[br]Congratulations.

00:08:20.29,00:08:23.92
Thank you. So how about you?[br]Are you seeing anybody?

00:08:24.17,00:08:25.49
Not right now.

00:08:25.89,00:08:27.37
Oh, well, that's okay.

00:08:28.73,00:08:29.53
I know.

00:08:34.01,00:08:36.21
So I think I'll get back[br]to my friend.

00:08:36.41,00:08:38.69
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

00:08:42.29,00:08:45.28
Can we have lunch[br]the next time I'm in the city?

00:08:45.53,00:08:46.60
That'd be great.

00:08:46.81,00:08:48.21
-Okay.[br]-Thanks.

00:08:50.01,00:08:53.48
Ten bucks says I never see[br]that woman again in my life.

00:08:54.25,00:08:56.53
No, honey, really. It's fine.

00:08:56.77,00:08:57.57
Just. . .

00:08:58.17,00:08:59.24
. . .go with Susan.

00:08:59.49,00:09:00.53
Really, I think--

00:09:01.25,00:09:03.69
I think girls' night out[br]is a great idea.

00:09:05.69,00:09:07.25
Okay. Okay. Bye.

00:09:07.77,00:09:11.00
-What are they doing?[br]-I don't know. Something girly.

00:09:14.69,00:09:15.92
Hey, you're early.

00:09:16.17,00:09:18.00
What are you doing with the lamp?

00:09:18.49,00:09:20.32
Just taking it to get rewired.

00:09:22.09,00:09:26.61
Don't take it where you took the[br]stereo. They've had that over a week.

00:09:34.41,00:09:37.13
Mr. Heckles, no one is making[br]any noise up here.

00:09:37.65,00:09:39.93
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

00:09:40.29,00:09:43.28
-You don't play the oboe.[br]-I could play the oboe.

00:09:44.17,00:09:47.00
Then I'm gonna have to ask you[br]to keep it down.

00:09:52.05,00:09:53.04
Who are you?

00:09:53.49,00:09:56.88
-I'm Eric, Chandler's new roommate.[br]-I'm Chandler's new roommate.

00:09:58.85,00:10:01.57
-I don't think so.[br]-I could be Chandler's new roommate.

00:10:02.29,00:10:05.04
-But he told me over the phone--[br]-He told me in person.

00:10:06.45,00:10:07.25
That's weird.

00:10:07.49,00:10:10.56
I'm going to go into[br]my new apartment now.

00:10:29.81,00:10:31.01
Hi again.

00:10:38.77,00:10:40.05
Thank you so much.

00:10:40.29,00:10:43.49
Don't thank me.[br]Thank the jerk that never showed up.

00:10:43.69,00:10:45.84
Okay, I gotta get to work.

00:10:46.89,00:10:49.25
-You want some help?[br]-No, thanks. I got it.

00:10:49.45,00:10:50.33
No, I don't!

00:10:51.85,00:10:53.00
You okay?

00:10:55.17,00:10:57.61
I stood up too fast.[br]Got a little head rush.

00:10:58.49,00:10:59.84
It's the heat.

00:11:03.05,00:11:04.64
And the humidity.

00:11:07.01,00:11:08.24
That's. . .

00:11:08.49,00:11:10.21
. . .a tough combination.

00:11:14.49,00:11:16.64
Do you want to come in[br]for some lemonade?

00:11:17.29,00:11:18.52
Like you wouldn't believe.

00:11:25.69,00:11:27.28
This is a great place.

00:11:28.57,00:11:29.56
Thank you.

00:11:30.49,00:11:32.61
Just make yourself comfortable.

00:11:33.57,00:11:34.69
Gotcha.

00:11:37.29,00:11:40.20
So this place is really[br]my grandmother's.

00:11:43.29,00:11:48.00
I got it when she moved to Florida.[br]Otherwise I could never afford it.

00:11:52.09,00:11:53.81
So if the landlord ever asks. . .

00:11:54.01,00:11:57.61
. . .I'm an 87-year-old woman who's[br]afraid of her vCR. You thirsty?

00:11:57.85,00:11:59.81
You bet I am!

00:12:01.29,00:12:02.09
Okay. . .

00:12:02.33,00:12:03.81
. . .here's your penis!

00:12:09.69,00:12:12.73
Oh, my God![br]What the hell are you doing?

00:12:12.97,00:12:15.61
You said, "You wanna come in[br]for some lemonade?"

00:12:15.81,00:12:17.04
So?

00:12:19.09,00:12:21.00
Were you just gonna give me lemonade?

00:12:22.37,00:12:23.44
Cover yourself up!

00:12:23.89,00:12:25.09
Oh, right. Sorry.

00:12:25.29,00:12:26.80
God, I don't believe this!

00:12:27.01,00:12:30.61
Someone asks you in for lemonade[br]and that means they want to have sex?

00:12:30.81,00:12:33.61
Usually, yeah.[br]Well, not just lemonade.

00:12:33.81,00:12:35.88
Iced tea, sometimes juice.

00:12:37.69,00:12:39.76
Look, sorry. I just--

00:12:40.41,00:12:41.64
I thought you liked me.

00:12:41.89,00:12:43.64
I'm such a jerk.

00:12:45.77,00:12:46.76
It's okay.

00:12:48.09,00:12:50.32
I suppose it could happen to anyone.

00:12:50.57,00:12:52.16
Not anyone I know, but. . . .

00:12:55.09,00:12:57.29
By the way, I can still see it.

00:13:09.89,00:13:10.93
Where's your bed?

00:13:14.01,00:13:16.13
It's not in the apartment?

00:13:21.61,00:13:23.97
I can't believe this[br]is happening again.

00:13:25.09,00:13:28.40
-What?[br]-Okay, enough with the third degree!

00:13:30.21,00:13:32.49
I don't live here anymore.

00:13:33.09,00:13:36.05
-What are you talking about?[br]-I'm sorry.

00:13:36.29,00:13:39.01
I don't live here anymore.

00:13:40.89,00:13:44.80
I didn't know how to tell you.[br]But, you know, everybody else knows.

00:13:47.05,00:13:49.12
Everybody knows?

00:13:49.37,00:13:52.57
That was supposed to be a good thing.[br]I forget why.

00:13:55.89,00:13:58.33
Do you know I couldn't sleep[br]for a month. . .

00:13:58.57,00:14:01.80
. . .because I got a dot of ink[br]on one of the sofa cushions?

00:14:02.37,00:14:04.52
You could've just turned[br]the cushion over.

00:14:04.77,00:14:07.65
I would have, but I had[br]a spaghetti stain on the other side.

00:14:08.09,00:14:08.89
What?

00:14:09.13,00:14:10.93
This is what I'm talking about.

00:14:11.17,00:14:14.40
I need to live in a land[br]where people can spill!

00:14:15.65,00:14:17.21
Well, you can spill.

00:14:17.81,00:14:19.09
In the sink.

00:14:19.97,00:14:23.96
Oh, honey. It's not your fault,[br]you know. This is who you are.

00:14:24.17,00:14:27.00
And I love you.[br]And I want us to be friends.

00:14:27.21,00:14:29.81
And if I stay here,[br]I don't see that happening.

00:14:31.85,00:14:34.16
-I love you too.[br]-Good.

00:14:37.49,00:14:38.37
What?

00:14:40.09,00:14:41.52
What? I'm just sad.

00:14:42.25,00:14:44.81
No, you're not.[br]You're wondering which cushion it is.

00:14:51.05,00:14:53.36
So what are you watching?

00:14:53.77,00:14:54.57
Baywatch.

00:14:56.61,00:14:58.04
What's it about?

00:14:59.69,00:15:01.04
Lifeguards.

00:15:01.81,00:15:04.25
Well, it sounds kind of stup--

00:15:04.81,00:15:05.77
Who's she?

00:15:07.29,00:15:08.36
Nicole Eggert.

00:15:09.01,00:15:10.41
We like her.

00:15:16.25,00:15:17.81
Wow! Look at them run!

00:15:20.09,00:15:21.41
They do that a lot.

00:15:24.41,00:15:25.84
Hey, you want a beer?

00:15:26.09,00:15:28.92
-I'll get one.[br]-Don't get up. I got a cooler here.

00:15:35.09,00:15:37.40
Do you have any beers?[br]We're out of beers.

00:15:37.61,00:15:39.41
Help yourself.

00:15:40.01,00:15:41.29
You okay?

00:15:43.89,00:15:45.17
Phoebe moved out.

00:15:47.69,00:15:48.52
Right.

00:15:49.41,00:15:51.24
I don't understand.

00:15:51.49,00:15:55.80
Am I so hard to live with?[br]ls this why I don't have a boyfriend?

00:15:57.21,00:15:59.93
You don't have a boyfriend because. . . .

00:16:01.29,00:16:04.60
I don't know why[br]you don't have a boyfriend.

00:16:05.37,00:16:07.09
You should have a boyfriend.

00:16:08.17,00:16:09.57
I think so.

00:16:11.77,00:16:12.76
Come here.

00:16:12.97,00:16:13.96
Come here.

00:16:16.49,00:16:19.61
Listen, you are one[br]of my favorite people. . .

00:16:19.81,00:16:23.80
. . .and the most beautiful woman[br]I've ever known in real life.

00:16:40.57,00:16:42.13
Where is everybody?

00:16:42.33,00:16:46.29
It's already closed. Chris gave me[br]the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

00:16:46.53,00:16:49.28
I think my marriage. . .

00:16:49.65,00:16:50.80
. . .is kind of over.

00:16:51.29,00:16:53.01
Oh, no! Why?

00:16:53.21,00:16:55.25
Because Carol's a lesbian.

00:16:59.65,00:17:01.13
And I'm not one.

00:17:04.97,00:17:07.72
And apparently it's not[br]a mix-and-match situation.

00:17:08.41,00:17:09.92
Oh, my God!

00:17:11.25,00:17:12.73
I don't believe it!

00:17:13.77,00:17:15.60
Oh, you poor bunny.

00:17:17.25,00:17:18.45
I'm an idiot.

00:17:19.25,00:17:21.00
I mean, I should have seen it.

00:17:21.21,00:17:26.05
I mean, Carol and I would be out,[br]and she'd see some beautiful woman. . .

00:17:26.29,00:17:29.33
. . .and she'd be "Ross! Look at her! "

00:17:29.57,00:17:30.97
And I'd think. . .

00:17:31.69,00:17:33.76
. . . "God, my wife is cool. "

00:17:40.61,00:17:43.60
Hey, do you think that Susan person[br]is her lover?

00:17:46.45,00:17:48.17
Well, now I do!

00:17:49.97,00:17:51.01
I'm sorry.

00:17:53.49,00:17:55.13
Seven years!

00:17:55.81,00:17:58.80
I mean, we've been together[br]seven years:

00:17:59.45,00:18:02.01
She's the only woman[br]who's ever loved me.

00:18:02.25,00:18:04.72
She's the only woman I've ever. . . .

00:18:11.61,00:18:13.12
This is nice.

00:18:13.37,00:18:14.93
I know. It is, isn't it?

00:18:16.69,00:18:19.57
No, I mean it.[br]This feels really good.

00:18:21.77,00:18:24.00
Is it 1 00%%% cotton?

00:18:28.61,00:18:30.28
And I got it on sale too.

00:18:31.65,00:18:32.45
I should go.

00:18:32.69,00:18:36.73
One of the lifeguards was just about[br]to dismantle a nuclear device.

00:18:37.49,00:18:39.80
If you want to get[br]a drink later, we can.

00:18:40.01,00:18:41.41
That sounds great.

00:18:42.17,00:18:43.97
Oh, and listen, it's gonna be--

00:18:44.37,00:18:45.33
I know.

00:18:46.21,00:18:47.28
Thanks.

00:18:51.49,00:18:55.37
Maybe this wouldn't have happened[br]if I'd been more nurturing. . .

00:18:55.85,00:18:59.16
. . .or I'd paid more attention. . .

00:18:59.49,00:19:01.24
. . .or I had a uterus.

00:19:03.09,00:19:04.81
-I can't believe it.[br]-I know.

00:19:05.05,00:19:08.25
You know, you don't deserve this.[br]You don't, Ross.

00:19:08.49,00:19:10.13
-You're so good.[br]-Thanks.

00:19:10.37,00:19:12.01
And you're so sweet.

00:19:12.21,00:19:14.60
-Thanks.[br]-And you're kind.

00:19:14.81,00:19:16.01
Thanks.

00:19:26.89,00:19:27.85
Come here.

00:19:29.57,00:19:31.08
Wait, wait, wait.

00:19:35.81,00:19:37.01
It's okay.

00:19:43.25,00:19:46.32
Wait, wait, wait![br]My foot is stuck in the pocket.

00:19:47.81,00:19:49.48
-What?[br]-I can't get it out.

00:19:49.73,00:19:52.37
That's not something[br]a girl wants to hear.

00:19:52.69,00:19:54.33
Come on, don't start.

00:19:56.01,00:19:56.81
What?

00:19:57.05,00:19:59.41
Stupid balls are in the way.

00:20:17.29,00:20:18.33
Oh, well.

00:20:19.61,00:20:23.52
That probably wouldn't have been[br]the most constructive solution.

00:20:24.41,00:20:26.21
You have chalk on your face.

00:20:27.57,00:20:31.53
You're right. I don't know why[br]I always thought this was real grass.

00:20:38.41,00:20:39.81
Honey, you okay?

00:20:41.05,00:20:43.01
My wife's a lesbian.

00:20:43.65,00:20:45.21
Cool!

00:20:48.57,00:20:50.72
Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

00:21:00.69,00:21:02.73
I can't believe you came back.

00:21:03.65,00:21:05.48
Don't say anything.

00:21:06.05,00:21:09.04
I don't wanna speak.[br]I don't wanna think.

00:21:09.25,00:21:13.85
I just want you to take me and kiss me[br]and make love to me right here. . .

00:21:14.09,00:21:15.32
. . .right now.

00:21:27.49,00:21:29.16
You missed the exit.

00:21:31.01,00:21:31.81
Sorry.

00:21:32.05,00:21:34.80
My God, what were you thinking about?

00:21:37.09,00:21:38.32
Barry.

So I told Carl, nobody, no matter[br]how famous their parents are. . .

00:00:05.84,00:00:08.12
. . .is allowed to climb[br]on the dinosaur.

00:00:08.32,00:00:10.36
Of course, it went[br]right in one ear. . . .

00:00:10.60,00:00:13.24
I love how he cares so much[br]about stuff.

00:00:13.48,00:00:16.87
If I squint, I can pretend[br]he's Alan Alda.

00:00:19.56,00:00:22.52
Oh, good. Another dinosaur story.

00:00:24.36,00:00:26.51
When are those gonna become extinct?

00:00:29.32,00:00:32.71
If I was a superhero who could fly[br]and be invisible...

00:00:32.96,00:00:35.11
... that would be the best.

00:00:39.68,00:00:41.91
What does Rachel see in this guy?

00:00:43.88,00:00:45.24
I love Rachel.

00:00:48.00,00:00:50.00
I wish she was my wife.

When you guys were kids[br]and you played Happy Days...

00:01:56.80,00:01:58.24
. . .who were you?[br]I was Richie.

00:01:58.48,00:02:00.00
I was always Joanie.

00:02:00.32,00:02:04.52
Question: Was "Egg the Gellers! "[br]the war cry of your neighborhood?

00:02:06.92,00:02:08.32
It's the Mattress King!

00:02:08.52,00:02:09.75
Change the channel!

00:02:10.00,00:02:12.31
Wait! I want to see this![br]After I divorce him. . .

00:02:12.56,00:02:15.52
. . .half of that kingdom[br]is gonna be mine!

00:02:15.88,00:02:18.56
Despair fills the mattress showroom.

00:02:18.88,00:02:21.64
My Kingdom is suddenly[br]without a Queen.

00:02:21.88,00:02:23.32
I'm so depressed...

00:02:23.56,00:02:25.00
...l'm going to slash...

00:02:25.20,00:02:26.19

499 for a pillow-top queen set!

00:02:31.48,00:02:33.71
I'm going medieval on prices!

00:02:33.92,00:02:35.36
What a wank!

00:02:35.92,00:02:39.71
I cannot believe he's using[br]our divorce to sell mattresses!

00:02:39.92,00:02:43.76
I know. At $499 for a pillow-top[br]queen, who cares about the divorce?

00:02:44.00,00:02:46.31
Those babies will sell themselves!

00:02:48.40,00:02:51.04
And I' m appalled for you, by the way.

00:02:52.28,00:02:55.52
I'm close! I'm cheap! I'm the King!

00:02:59.80,00:03:03.32
Okay, Daddy. We'll see you[br]tomorrow night. Okay, bye-bye.

00:03:05.60,00:03:06.75
"We"?

00:03:07.20,00:03:11.20
--are having dinner with my Dad[br]tomorrow night. I hope that's okay.

00:03:11.56,00:03:13.36
Oh, shoot![br]Tomorrow's not good.

00:03:13.60,00:03:15.91
I' m supposed to fall off[br]the Empire State Building. . .

00:03:16.16,00:03:18.60
. . .and land on a bicycle[br]with no seat, so. . . .

00:03:21.20,00:03:23.16
My father doesn't hate you.

00:03:23.40,00:03:26.04
Please. He refers to me[br]as "Wet-Head. "

00:03:27.28,00:03:29.72
Honey, he calls everybody[br]by a nickname.

00:03:29.96,00:03:32.96
I know. Just one dinner.[br]One night. For me. Please?

00:03:33.20,00:03:35.96
I just want him to love you like I do.

00:03:36.56,00:03:38.76
All right. Well, not exactly[br]like I do.

00:03:39.72,00:03:41.56
But if you do come to dinner. . .

00:03:41.80,00:03:44.92
. . .I'll love you like I do[br]in that black thing that you like.

00:03:45.68,00:03:46.64
I'll go.

00:03:50.52,00:03:51.32
Fine.

00:03:51.56,00:03:53.00
Thank you.

00:03:56.72,00:03:57.76
Hi, Gunther.

00:03:58.00,00:03:59.92
Yeah. We'll see.

00:04:02.20,00:04:03.35
Hey, you guys!

00:04:03.80,00:04:04.79
Guess what.

00:04:05.36,00:04:06.80
-I got a gig![br]-Great!

00:04:07.20,00:04:10.32
That's why I can never be an actor.[br]I can't say "gig. "

00:04:10.56,00:04:13.52
I can't say "croissant. "[br]Oh, my God!

00:04:15.08,00:04:17.04
-What's the part?[br]-It's not a part.

00:04:17.28,00:04:20.12
I' m teaching Acting for Soap Operas[br]at the Learning Extension.

00:04:20.32,00:04:21.64
Come on! That's great!

00:04:21.88,00:04:24.11
It's my chance to give[br]something back. . .

00:04:24.36,00:04:26.51
. . .to the acting community.

00:04:26.84,00:04:29.84
You' re probably not allowed to sleep[br]with your students.

00:04:34.68,00:04:35.51
I know.

00:04:41.60,00:04:44.12
I don't know, Monica.[br]It feels funny just being here.

00:04:44.40,00:04:46.92
If you buy a bed from[br]Janice's ex-husband. . .

00:04:47.16,00:04:48.80
. . .it's like betraying Chandler.

00:04:49.00,00:04:50.64
Not at these prices!

00:04:57.16,00:05:00.71
You know, in England this car would be[br]on the other side of the store.

00:05:11.88,00:05:12.92
Come here.

00:05:13.96,00:05:14.95
This is my new bed!

00:05:15.20,00:05:17.35
You gotta feel this bad boy!

00:05:18.00,00:05:20.92
Monica, it still feels so weird,[br]you know?

00:05:21.16,00:05:22.52
Chandler's your friend.

00:05:23.60,00:05:25.16
Oh, my God!

00:05:27.00,00:05:30.12
All right, take this bed.[br]You can make other friends.

00:05:38.56,00:05:39.47
Good evening.

00:05:40.20,00:05:41.88
I am Mr. Tribbiani.

00:05:43.92,00:05:46.44
And I will be teaching[br]Acting for Soap Operas.

00:05:46.88,00:05:47.84
Now. . .

00:05:48.72,00:05:53.40
. . .on my first day as Dr. Drake[br]Ramoray on Days Of Our Lives...

00:05:56.88,00:06:01.04
. . .I learned one of the most important[br]things in soap opera acting. . .

00:06:01.28,00:06:02.48
. . .is reacting.

00:06:02.80,00:06:05.11
This does not mean acting again.

00:06:06.68,00:06:09.56
It means you don't have a line,[br]but someone else just did.

00:06:09.80,00:06:11.72
And it goes something like this.

00:06:18.92,00:06:20.20
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

00:06:20.44,00:06:22.96
By the way, before I forget.[br]To work in soap operas. . .

00:06:23.20,00:06:25.59
. . .some of you will have to[br]become more attractive.

00:06:27.44,00:06:29.24
All right, moving right along. . . .

00:06:34.52,00:06:38.12
-How was teaching last night?[br]-Great! You get to say stuff like. . .

00:06:38.32,00:06:42.68
. . . "Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.[br]I dismiss you. "

00:06:43.88,00:06:45.11
Oh, nice.

00:06:45.32,00:06:47.79
Oh, and I got an audition[br]for All My Children!

00:06:48.64,00:06:49.92
It's this great part.

00:06:50.12,00:06:51.40
This boxer named Nick.

00:06:51.60,00:06:54.24
And I' m so, so right for it.[br]He's just like me.

00:06:54.48,00:06:56.16
Except that he's a boxer. . .

00:06:56.40,00:06:58.00
. . .and has an evil twin.

00:07:04.72,00:07:07.88
Hear ye, hear ye![br]Delivery from the Mattress King!

00:07:10.44,00:07:11.64
You Miss Geller?

00:07:12.56,00:07:13.68
Sign here.

00:07:15.20,00:07:16.76
Do I have a middle name?

00:07:17.00,00:07:19.72
All right. Monica "Felula" . . .

00:07:20.72,00:07:21.71
. . .Geller.

00:07:22.00,00:07:23.48
It's that bedroom there.

00:07:27.00,00:07:29.44
Monica bought a bed[br]from the Mattress King?

00:07:29.68,00:07:32.84
Please, please, please[br]don't say anything to Chandler.

00:07:33.32,00:07:35.68
-You want me to lie to him?[br]-Is that a problem?

00:07:38.20,00:07:40.92
Oh, hey, "Nick the boxer. "[br]Let's see what you got!

00:07:41.16,00:07:42.72
All right, put them up.

00:07:42.92,00:07:45.12
Hey, you' re pretty good at this.

00:07:45.32,00:07:47.44
I had to learn.[br]I was staying at the "Y" . . .

00:07:47.68,00:07:50.72
. . .and some of the young men[br]weren't acting Christian enough.

00:07:53.28,00:07:54.16
Hey, now!

00:07:56.60,00:07:58.36
And I' m bleeding.[br]Okay, great.

00:07:58.56,00:08:00.92
Wow! And I' m a vegetarian!

00:08:02.52,00:08:04.56
I' m sorry.[br]We'll put some ice on it.

00:08:04.80,00:08:06.44
Put your head back.

00:08:06.68,00:08:08.16
-I can't see.[br]-I have you.

00:08:08.40,00:08:09.60
Oh, God!

00:08:11.08,00:08:13.55
Which bedroom do you want it in,[br]Ms. Geller?

00:08:13.80,00:08:16.44
It's the compulsively neat one[br]by the window.

00:08:16.68,00:08:17.91
Gotcha.

00:08:25.00,00:08:26.07
Hi, Daddy!

00:08:26.96,00:08:28.32
This is where they put us?

00:08:28.56,00:08:31.52
What? There was no table[br]in the kitchen?

00:08:32.56,00:08:34.71
-Hello, baby.[br]-You remember Ross.

00:08:34.92,00:08:36.84
Nice to see you again, Dr. Greene.

00:08:37.08,00:08:38.15
So!

00:08:43.76,00:08:45.99
-How's the library?[br]-Museum.

00:08:46.88,00:08:49.96
-What happened to the library?[br]-There never was a library.

00:08:50.20,00:08:52.72
I mean, there are libraries.[br]It's just. . .

00:08:52.96,00:08:54.92
. . .that I've never worked at one.

00:08:58.36,00:09:01.28
You know what's really good here?[br]The lobster.

00:09:01.60,00:09:04.40
-Shall I just order three?[br]-If you' re really hungry.

00:09:10.08,00:09:12.00
It was a joke. I made a joke.

00:09:13.28,00:09:15.92
Actually, Daddy,[br]Ross is allergic to lobster.

00:09:16.12,00:09:19.88
Who's allergic to lobster? I guess[br]someone that works in a library.

00:09:20.64,00:09:22.12
-It's--[br]-I know. It's a museum!

00:09:22.36,00:09:25.75
You' re the only who can make a joke?[br]At least mine was funny.

00:09:26.00,00:09:26.80
Waiter.

00:09:27.20,00:09:30.08
We will have two lobsters[br]and a menu.

00:09:34.00,00:09:36.44
So, Dr. Greene, how's the old boat?

00:09:36.68,00:09:39.99
They found rust. Do you know[br]what rust does to a boat?

00:09:40.48,00:09:42.36
Gives it a nice antique-y look?

00:09:47.20,00:09:50.32
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.

00:09:50.76,00:09:52.20
Wow, I' m sorry.

00:09:52.44,00:09:54.64
When I was a kid,[br]I lost a bike to that.

00:10:00.60,00:10:01.83
Excuse me for a moment.

00:10:02.08,00:10:04.52
I want to say good night[br]to the Levines before we go.

00:10:09.20,00:10:11.20
Honey, stop. It's not that bad.

00:10:14.36,00:10:17.56
Your dad must have added wrong.[br]He only tipped 4%%% .

00:10:17.80,00:10:19.56
Yeah. That's Daddy.

00:10:20.00,00:10:24.12
"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it[br]bother you? You' re a waitress.

00:10:24.32,00:10:25.76
Yes, it bothers me.

00:10:26.00,00:10:29.96
If he was a regular at the coffee[br]house, I'd be serving him sneezers.

00:10:31.00,00:10:32.56
-So?[br]-So, Ross. . .

00:10:32.80,00:10:36.43
. . .I've bugged him about this[br]a million times. He won't change.

00:10:36.68,00:10:39.32
Do you really serve people sneezers?

00:10:40.12,00:10:41.72
Well, I don't.

00:10:42.88,00:10:44.24
All right, kids. Ready?

00:10:44.68,00:10:46.91
Thanks again, Dr. Greene.

00:10:52.16,00:10:54.63
Wait, I think I forgot my receipt.

00:10:54.88,00:10:56.52
-You don't need that.[br]-Why not?

00:10:56.72,00:11:00.88
The carbon. It's messy. I mean,[br]gets on your fingers and causes. . .

00:11:01.12,00:11:02.44
. . .night blindness.

00:11:05.68,00:11:06.64
What is this?

00:11:07.56,00:11:09.08
Who put a 20 down here?

00:11:09.68,00:11:11.64
Oh, yeah, that would be me.

00:11:12.40,00:11:13.84
I have a problem.

00:11:14.08,00:11:15.92
I tip way too much.[br]Way too much.

00:11:16.12,00:11:18.12
-It's a sickness, really.[br]-Yeah, it is.

00:11:18.36,00:11:21.16
-We have to do something about that.[br]-Excuse me.

00:11:21.48,00:11:23.32
You think I' m cheap?

00:11:23.60,00:11:26.52
He didn't mean anything by that.[br]He really didn't.

00:11:26.76,00:11:29.32
Nothing I do means anything. Really.

00:11:31.40,00:11:33.55
This is nice.[br]I pay $200 for dinner.

00:11:33.80,00:11:37.11
You put down $20 and you come out[br]looking like Mr. Big Shot.

00:11:37.32,00:11:39.52
You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?[br]Here.

00:11:39.76,00:11:43.72
I'll tell you what. You pay the[br]whole bill, Mr. Big Shot. All right?

00:11:46.20,00:11:49.51
Well, "Mr. Big Shot" is better[br]than "Wet-Head. "

00:11:51.00,00:11:53.15
Okay, some tricks of the trade.

00:11:53.40,00:11:56.12
Now, I've never been able to cry[br]as an actor. . .

00:11:56.36,00:11:58.24
. . .so if I have to cry. . .

00:11:58.48,00:12:00.24
. . .I cut a hole in my pocket. . .

00:12:00.48,00:12:02.32
. . .take a pair of tweezers. . .

00:12:03.00,00:12:04.80
. . .and just start pulling.

00:12:07.72,00:12:10.24
Or let's say I want to convey. . .

00:12:10.48,00:12:13.12
. . .that I've just done[br]something evil.

00:12:13.32,00:12:17.20
That would be your basic I've-got-a-[br]fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-l-like-it.

00:12:22.48,00:12:24.52
Let's say I've just gotten bad news.

00:12:24.76,00:12:29.16
Well, all I do there[br]is try and divide 232 by 1 3.

00:12:38.36,00:12:39.72
And that's how it's done.

00:12:39.92,00:12:42.12
Great soap opera acting[br]tonight, everybody.

00:12:42.32,00:12:43.60
Class dismissed.

00:12:46.00,00:12:47.28
Hey, Mr. Trib.

00:12:47.68,00:12:49.72
Guess what? I got an audition!

00:12:50.72,00:12:53.19
One of my students got an audition.[br]I' m so proud!

00:12:54.72,00:12:57.08
I was wondering if you'd[br]coach me for it.

00:12:57.32,00:12:58.92
You bet! What's the part?

00:12:59.12,00:12:59.95
Oh, it's great!

00:13:00.20,00:13:02.88
It's a role on All My Children.[br]Nick the boxer.

00:13:11.92,00:13:13.76
You couldn't leave it alone.

00:13:14.00,00:13:18.32
Four percent, okay? I tip more than[br]that when there's a bug in my food.

00:13:18.76,00:13:21.48
Tonight was about the two of you[br]getting along.

00:13:22.20,00:13:24.32
Would you just see[br]my chiropractor already?

00:13:24.56,00:13:28.32
I' m gonna go to a doctor who went[br]to medical school in a mini-mall.

00:13:32.60,00:13:34.52
Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?

00:13:34.72,00:13:36.68
I' m freaking out!

00:13:39.40,00:13:42.71
Monica trusted me with something[br]and she shouldn't have!

00:13:43.20,00:13:45.96
I haven't lived here in a while,[br]so I have to ask you.

00:13:46.20,00:13:48.48
Does Monica still turn the lights on[br]in her room?

00:13:51.56,00:13:52.44
I am so dead!

00:13:54.96,00:13:56.72
Look, here's the bottom line.

00:13:56.92,00:13:59.36
This is fixable if we act fast, okay?

00:13:59.60,00:14:02.24
I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow,[br]and you can make nice.

00:14:02.44,00:14:05.52
Honey, I have tried to make nice.[br]It doesn't work.

00:14:05.72,00:14:07.72
Look, I realize my father[br]is difficult.

00:14:07.96,00:14:11.35
But that's why you have got to be[br]the bigger man here.

00:14:11.60,00:14:15.12
Sweetie, I could be the bigger man.[br]I could be the biggest man.

00:14:15.32,00:14:18.84
I could be a huge, giant man, and[br]it still wouldn't make a difference.

00:14:19.08,00:14:23.24
Except I could pick your father up and[br]say, "Like me! Like me, tiny doctor! "

00:14:25.00,00:14:28.31
Can't you just try it one more time?[br]For me? For me?

00:14:28.52,00:14:30.96
One brunch is not gonna[br]solve anything.

00:14:31.20,00:14:33.32
Face it.[br]We' re never gonna get along.

00:14:33.56,00:14:35.76
Well, you are just going to have to.

00:14:36.00,00:14:39.36
I've already got a mother and father[br]who cannot stay in the same room.

00:14:39.60,00:14:42.32
I don't want to have a separate room[br]for you too!

00:14:44.16,00:14:45.64
I'll get the bagels.

00:14:50.60,00:14:51.83
What's this?

00:14:52.92,00:14:54.52
Isn't it cool?

00:14:57.16,00:14:58.96
This is not the bed I ordered.

00:14:59.20,00:15:02.12
I know! You must have won[br]a contest or something.

00:15:05.92,00:15:07.56
Why is this car in my bedroom?

00:15:07.80,00:15:09.64
I' m sorry. I wasn't looking. . .

00:15:09.84,00:15:12.88
. . .and the store won't take[br]it back, because you signed for it.

00:15:13.16,00:15:15.55
-When did I sign for it?[br]-When I was you.

00:15:15.80,00:15:18.56
It's all Joey's fault,[br]because he left his nose open!

00:15:20.88,00:15:22.40
Did you make brownies today?

00:15:23.80,00:15:24.71
Knock, knock!

00:15:24.96,00:15:28.12
Quick! Take off your dress.[br]He won't notice the bed.

00:15:29.80,00:15:32.72
I' m going for sushi.[br]Does anybody want--?

00:15:34.52,00:15:36.64
Somebody missed the off-ramp!

00:15:39.28,00:15:41.00
It's Monica's bed. What?

00:15:43.92,00:15:45.64
It's a racecar!

00:15:46.72,00:15:49.36
This has always been Monica's bed.[br]You just noticed?

00:15:49.60,00:15:51.40
How self-involved are you?

00:15:53.56,00:15:57.56
If this bed isn't new, then how come[br]there's plastic on the mattress?

00:15:59.88,00:16:01.48
Sometimes I have bad dreams.

00:16:05.52,00:16:06.43
Look. . .

00:16:06.96,00:16:10.96
. . .I just saw my best friend's[br]brain smeared across the canvas.

00:16:11.32,00:16:13.04
It's not gonna be me.

00:16:13.52,00:16:14.35
Not me.

00:16:18.60,00:16:19.96
That was good.

00:16:20.20,00:16:21.00
That was--

00:16:21.88,00:16:22.92
Tweezers?

00:16:26.20,00:16:28.24
-That was really good.[br]-Thanks.

00:16:29.40,00:16:30.44
Any suggestions?

00:16:37.24,00:16:39.68
You told him to play the boxer gay?

00:16:43.72,00:16:45.36
I might have said. . .

00:16:45.60,00:16:46.96
. . . "super-gay. "

00:16:48.36,00:16:50.20
You totally screwed him over.

00:16:50.40,00:16:53.12
You' re this guy's teacher.[br]How could you do this?

00:16:53.32,00:16:55.16
Because the guy's so good.

00:16:55.40,00:16:57.76
And I really, really want this part.

00:16:58.00,00:17:00.84
Well, if you really, really want it,[br]then it's okay.

00:17:03.20,00:17:04.88
-Hi, Daddy.[br]-Baby.

00:17:08.00,00:17:09.92
Dr. Greene, how are you?

00:17:12.48,00:17:14.16
Thanks for dinner last night.

00:17:14.40,00:17:17.00
Thank you for teaching me[br]a valuable lesson.

00:17:17.56,00:17:19.63
Nice hair. What did you do, swim here?

00:17:23.36,00:17:25.51
That's it.[br]I can't take it anymore.

00:17:25.72,00:17:30.12
What? He likes your hair and just[br]wants to know how you got here.

00:17:31.12,00:17:34.20
-It's hopeless. I' m just gonna go.[br]-What?

00:17:34.44,00:17:36.32
-I' m sorry. It's just--[br]-Ross?

00:17:36.72,00:17:38.00
What's with the neck?

00:17:38.20,00:17:40.92
I keep telling him[br]to go to my chiropractor.

00:17:41.12,00:17:42.84
You still going to him?

00:17:43.08,00:17:45.36
He couldn't get into[br]med school in lxtapa!

00:17:46.20,00:17:48.67
Thank you.[br]That's what I keep saying.

00:17:48.88,00:17:52.35
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens[br]to be an excellent doctor.

00:17:52.60,00:17:55.68
Wait a minute.[br]His name is Dr. Bobby?

00:17:56.84,00:17:59.04
-That's his last name.[br]-And his first name.

00:17:59.24,00:18:00.88
He's Bobby Bobby?

00:18:02.92,00:18:04.56
It's Robert Bobby.

00:18:06.12,00:18:08.96
And excuse me. He helps me.

00:18:09.16,00:18:11.80
-Please. Ask her how?[br]-What do you need help for?

00:18:12.00,00:18:14.15
My alignment.[br]One leg's shorter than the other.

00:18:14.36,00:18:16.32
-Oh, my God.[br]-Argue with that.

00:18:16.52,00:18:18.72
My right leg is two inches shorter!

00:18:18.96,00:18:20.96
Come on, you' re just tilting!

00:18:22.20,00:18:24.12
-Her legs are fine.[br]-I know that.

00:18:24.32,00:18:27.00
-So why do you let her go to him?[br]-"Let her"?

00:18:27.24,00:18:30.55
She doesn't listen to me[br]about renter's insurance, either.

00:18:30.80,00:18:33.52
Wait a minute. You don't have[br]renter's insurance?

00:18:37.52,00:18:42.12
How you gonna run after a thief,[br]with one leg shorter than the other?

00:18:47.52,00:18:51.04
-Would you like some juice?[br]-I'd love some juice.

00:18:52.80,00:18:55.64
This is going so well![br]Did you see us? Did you see?

00:18:55.88,00:18:58.11
Yeah, honey. I was standing[br]right there.

00:18:58.68,00:19:00.75
Why don't you tell him about[br]my mole?

00:19:01.16,00:19:02.07
Excellent!

00:19:06.60,00:19:09.16
There will come a time[br]in each of your careers. . .

00:19:09.40,00:19:13.32
. . .when you'll have a chance to screw[br]over another soap opera actor.

00:19:14.00,00:19:17.08
I had such an opportunity[br]in the recent present.

00:19:19.52,00:19:21.52
And I' m ashamed to say. . .

00:19:22.00,00:19:23.15
. . .that I took it.

00:19:24.68,00:19:28.20
I advised a fellow actor[br]to play a role. . .

00:19:29.68,00:19:31.12
. . .homosexually.

00:19:36.36,00:19:39.28
We both auditioned for the part. . .

00:19:40.72,00:19:42.40
. . .and as it turned out. . .

00:19:43.32,00:19:44.28
. . .they. . . .

00:19:46.00,00:19:48.92
They liked the stupid "gay" thing[br]and cast him.

00:19:51.48,00:19:52.92
And now. . .

00:19:53.20,00:19:56.08
. . .he's got a two-year contract. . .

00:19:57.40,00:19:59.08
. . .opposite Susan Lucci. . .

00:19:59.56,00:20:02.40
. . .the first lady[br]of daytime television.

00:20:03.48,00:20:04.44
And me?

00:20:05.32,00:20:08.84
Me, I' m stuck here teaching[br]a bunch of people. . .

00:20:09.08,00:20:12.24
. . .most of whom are too ugly[br]to even be on Tv.

00:20:14.96,00:20:17.03
I' m sorry. I' m sorry.

00:20:26.56,00:20:27.55
Thank you.

00:20:31.84,00:20:33.20
-May I help you?[br]-Yes, hi.

00:20:33.44,00:20:36.08
I' m the lady who got stuck[br]with the racecar bed.

00:20:36.32,00:20:40.36
Look, it's like I told you.[br]There's nothing I can do.

00:20:40.60,00:20:44.28
You signed for it.[br]"Monica Felula Geller. "

00:20:45.48,00:20:47.52
All right, we wanna see the King.

00:20:47.72,00:20:49.56
Nobody sees the King.

00:20:50.52,00:20:52.52
Okay. I' m talking to the King.

00:20:52.72,00:20:54.60
Hey, you can't go back there!

00:21:00.12,00:21:03.24
Oh, my God.

00:21:17.60,00:21:19.52
Hey, watch it, lady!

00:21:25.48,00:21:27.36
Hey, good-looking.

00:21:37.00,00:21:38.52
All right, I'll leave.

00:21:39.12,00:21:40.80
My bed's so boring.

00:00:02.95,00:00:04.31
Here you go, Pheebs.

00:00:04.51,00:00:07.03
Who wants one of my[br]special home-baked brownies?

00:00:07.23,00:00:08.22
I'll have one.

00:00:10.67,00:00:12.63
-That's okay.[br]-I'm not having one.

00:00:13.31,00:00:15.22
No, no. It's just my tooth.

00:00:15.47,00:00:17.23
-All right.[br]-I'll have one.

00:00:18.31,00:00:20.75
So you need a dentist?[br]I've got a good one.

00:00:20.99,00:00:25.03
Thanks. I have a good one too.[br]I just can't see him.

00:00:25.27,00:00:27.95
See, that is the problem[br]with invisible dentists.

00:00:29.71,00:00:30.86
Why can't you go to him?

00:00:31.11,00:00:35.79
Because every time I go[br]to the dentist, somebody dies.

00:00:37.07,00:00:39.79
That's so weird.[br]Every time I go to the dentist. . .

00:00:39.99,00:00:42.03
. . .I look down the hygienist's blouse.

00:00:45.43,00:00:46.42
What?

00:00:46.67,00:00:48.23
First it was my Aunt Mary.

00:00:48.47,00:00:50.75
And then there was John, my mailman.

00:00:50.99,00:00:53.55
And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.

00:00:54.71,00:00:56.83
And all these people actually died?

00:00:57.03,00:00:59.02
Yes. While I was in the chair.

00:00:59.23,00:01:02.35
That's why I take care of my teeth.[br]It's not about oral hygiene.

00:01:02.59,00:01:04.50
I floss to save lives.

00:01:05.51,00:01:07.27
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.

00:01:07.51,00:01:11.03
These people just happened to die[br]when you went to the dentist.

00:01:11.23,00:01:12.63
It's just a coincidence.

00:01:12.83,00:01:15.47
Tell that to them.[br]Oh, you can't! They're dead!

00:01:17.19,00:01:19.26

00:02:04.79,00:02:06.19
Thanks, Gunther.

00:02:07.19,00:02:08.63
Can I get a napkin too?

00:02:08.83,00:02:11.43
Oh, like you don't already[br]have everything.

00:02:16.59,00:02:19.95
You're in pain. Would you just[br]go to the dentist? Just go.

00:02:20.19,00:02:22.07
Fine. But if you're my next victim. . .

00:02:22.31,00:02:25.59
. . .don't come back as a poltergeist[br]who sucks me into the Tv set.

00:02:26.51,00:02:27.34
I promise.

00:02:27.59,00:02:29.39
Although, don't feel[br]like you can't visit.

00:02:31.87,00:02:33.59
Hey, is Chandler here?

00:02:35.59,00:02:37.03
No. No, he's not.

00:02:38.47,00:02:42.91
You guys, Joey just saw[br]Janice kissing her ex-husband.

00:02:43.11,00:02:44.15
What?

00:02:44.39,00:02:47.23
What are you gonna do?[br]How are you gonna tell Chandler?

00:02:47.47,00:02:50.55
I was thinking about that.[br]I think the best way would be. . .

00:02:50.79,00:02:51.67
. . .to not.

00:02:52.67,00:02:55.67
Joey, if you know about this,[br]you have to tell him.

00:02:55.91,00:02:58.03
It'll kill him.[br]It'll just kill him.

00:02:58.27,00:03:00.99
Wait till I go to the dentist.[br]Maybe I'll kill him.

00:03:06.31,00:03:11.23
I think Naked Guy's using a hammock.[br]It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.

00:03:11.99,00:03:14.06
I'm going to the dentist.[br]So listen. . .

00:03:14.31,00:03:18.23
. . .just be on the lookout for anything[br]that you could fall into. . .

00:03:18.47,00:03:20.94
. . .or that can fall on you. . .

00:03:21.19,00:03:21.99
: : :or: : : :

00:03:22.47,00:03:24.03
All right, just look out!

00:03:25.91,00:03:27.51
And I also just want to. . . .

00:03:28.11,00:03:30.91
I just want to tell you all that. . . .

00:03:36.23,00:03:39.23
I have a problem. I have to go[br]into work for a few hours.

00:03:39.47,00:03:42.11
Some kids messed up[br]the Homo sapien display.

00:03:42.31,00:03:43.22
What did they do?

00:03:43.43,00:03:46.39
They painted over the word[br]"sapien," for one thing.

00:03:47.27,00:03:51.90
Then they rearranged the figures.[br]Let's just leave it at that.

00:03:52.39,00:03:54.27
Do you want me to watch Ben for you?

00:03:54.51,00:03:56.42
That's what I was gonna ask.[br]Thank you.

00:03:56.63,00:03:58.51
Wait, hello![br]What about me?

00:03:58.71,00:04:01.99
You. You want to watch Ben?

00:04:06.19,00:04:08.63
That would be great![br]I just asked Monica. . .

00:04:08.87,00:04:10.91
. . .because I know how empty[br]her life is.

00:04:16.19,00:04:17.67
I got a science question.

00:04:17.91,00:04:22.62
If the Homo sapiens were, in fact,[br]"homo" sapiens. . .

00:04:24.71,00:04:26.23
. . .is that why they're extinct?

00:04:29.91,00:04:32.95
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.

00:04:33.19,00:04:34.42
Hey, I'm not judging.

00:04:37.31,00:04:38.79
Look, Benny! Spoon!

00:04:39.71,00:04:40.78
Spoon!

00:04:42.87,00:04:45.83
Come on. All right, you know what?[br]I think he's bored.

00:04:46.31,00:04:48.43
Here. You wanna play[br]the airplane game?

00:04:48.67,00:04:50.35
You wanna show Rachel?[br]Come here.

00:04:50.59,00:04:52.71
You wanna do something fun? Okay.

00:05:03.51,00:05:06.43
You're so brave.[br]You're so brave! Yes, you are.

00:05:06.67,00:05:08.43
-You're so brave.[br]-You're okay.

00:05:08.67,00:05:10.74
He's fine.[br]Let's just put him down.

00:05:10.99,00:05:13.67
Come here, babe.[br]Yes, you're such a good boy.

00:05:13.91,00:05:17.95
How could you do that to him?![br]Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say?

00:05:18.19,00:05:20.07
Nothing, because we're not[br]telling him.

00:05:20.31,00:05:21.27
-We're not?[br]-No.

00:05:21.51,00:05:22.95
All right, I like that.

00:05:24.23,00:05:26.27
So we're okay.[br]We're okay, aren't we?

00:05:26.51,00:05:28.63
No, we're not okay.[br]There's a bump.

00:05:28.83,00:05:29.87
What bump?

00:05:30.11,00:05:32.63
Oh, my God! Well, push it in![br]Push it in!

00:05:32.83,00:05:34.98
I cannot push it in!

00:05:36.23,00:05:38.22
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.

00:05:38.43,00:05:39.55
That's it.

00:05:39.79,00:05:40.75
I got it!

00:05:41.07,00:05:42.63
The second Ross walks in. . .

00:05:42.83,00:05:45.43
. . .take him to your bedroom[br]and do whatever you do. . .

00:05:45.67,00:05:47.50
. . .that makes him go "rheeeee! "

00:05:49.39,00:05:50.27
Or. . .

00:05:52.27,00:05:54.15
. . .we could put a hat on his head.

00:05:54.39,00:05:58.99
A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where[br]are we gonna find a tiny little hat?

00:05:59.19,00:06:00.67
I'll get Rainy Day Bear!

00:06:00.91,00:06:03.03
Because he'll know what to do?

00:06:03.51,00:06:05.07
Oh, my God.[br]You're a genius!

00:06:05.31,00:06:06.95
It's kind of sewn on.

00:06:07.19,00:06:08.31
Give it. Give it.

00:06:13.07,00:06:16.03
It's just like a bloodbath[br]in here today!

00:06:21.03,00:06:23.55
Hey, hold on a second.[br]Hold on a second.

00:06:24.83,00:06:27.11
Do you think these pearls are nice?

00:06:27.31,00:06:29.03
I'd prefer a mountain bike.

00:06:30.39,00:06:34.02
Janice's birthday's coming.[br]I wanna get her something special.

00:06:34.99,00:06:36.90
-Come in here with me.[br]-Wait!

00:06:39.47,00:06:41.86
You wanna get her something special?[br]Get her flowers.

00:06:42.11,00:06:44.47
Get her candy. Get her gum.[br]Girls love gum.

00:06:45.07,00:06:48.46
That's a good idea. "Dear Janice:[br]Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. "

00:06:49.87,00:06:52.26
I'd like to get her something serious.

00:06:52.51,00:06:54.50
You want something serious.

00:06:54.75,00:06:57.75
You know what you should do?[br]You should get her one of those. . .

00:06:57.99,00:06:59.51
. . .barium enemas.

00:07:01.63,00:07:03.35
Those are dead serious.

00:07:03.71,00:07:07.95
Look, I'm gonna go in here.[br]And you don't buy me anything, ever!

00:07:08.19,00:07:10.63
You can't! You can't.[br]You can't buy her pearls.

00:07:10.87,00:07:13.18
You just can't, you can't,[br]you can't!

00:07:13.39,00:07:14.51
Why not?

00:07:16.51,00:07:17.34
Oh, God.

00:07:19.51,00:07:20.58
Here's the thing.

00:07:21.87,00:07:23.67
This is the thing.[br]Okay, the thing is--

00:07:23.91,00:07:25.11
What is the thing?

00:07:26.79,00:07:29.83
I went down to the[br]Mattress King's showroom. . .

00:07:30.07,00:07:32.87
. . .and I saw Janice kissing[br]her ex-husband.

00:07:34.67,00:07:35.63
What?

00:07:36.19,00:07:37.83
They were in his office.

00:07:40.87,00:07:43.63
She wouldn't do that.[br]She's with me.

00:07:43.91,00:07:45.43
I'm telling you, I saw it.

00:07:45.63,00:07:47.43
Well, you're wrong.[br]You're wrong.

00:07:47.67,00:07:49.11
I'm not wrong.

00:07:49.31,00:07:50.79
I wish I was.

00:07:53.11,00:07:54.39
I'm sorry.

00:07:58.51,00:08:01.03
Bet that barium enema[br]doesn't sound so bad now.

00:08:03.51,00:08:08.22
It makes more sense as an ensemble.[br]And it takes the focus off the hat.

00:08:09.19,00:08:11.71
Oh! You're alive![br]You're alive!

00:08:13.35,00:08:15.74
I promised you no one[br]would die, didn't l?

00:08:15.99,00:08:19.27
We'll see about that. Can I use your[br]phone to call everyone I know?

00:08:19.51,00:08:21.66
Sure. We have no money. Go ahead.

00:08:23.39,00:08:26.03
Hey, you're not dead![br]Okay, see you.

00:08:28.59,00:08:30.07
Monica.

00:08:30.51,00:08:32.82
Oh, my God! He just said my name!

00:08:33.07,00:08:34.39
Did you hear that?

00:08:35.47,00:08:37.23
Monica bang!

00:08:40.39,00:08:41.95
Okay, I heard that.

00:08:42.87,00:08:44.86
Did he just say, "Monica bang"?

00:08:45.11,00:08:47.83
Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out!

00:08:48.51,00:08:50.03
Monica bang!

00:08:51.47,00:08:54.62
Sweetie, you need to stop[br]saying that now.

00:08:54.83,00:08:57.22
It's no big deal.[br]It's not even worth mentioning.

00:08:57.47,00:08:59.43
You see? We all do it all the time.

00:08:59.67,00:09:00.95
See? Watch this.

00:09:02.87,00:09:05.55
Monica bang![br]Everybody bang!

00:09:05.91,00:09:06.82
Ben bang!

00:09:07.07,00:09:08.39
Rachel bang!

00:09:08.91,00:09:10.82
Bang, Rachel! Bang!

00:09:11.39,00:09:13.70
-Oh, isn't it fun?[br]-Look at that!

00:09:14.23,00:09:15.06
We all do it!

00:09:15.71,00:09:18.10
-Okay, I'm stopping now.[br]-Are you okay?

00:09:18.51,00:09:22.11
You know, if it's not[br]a headboard, it's just not worth it.

00:09:32.67,00:09:34.79
How's my Bing-a-ling?

00:09:38.51,00:09:39.55
I don't know.

00:09:40.27,00:09:41.59
You tell me.

00:09:42.63,00:09:45.02
Anything you want to tell me?

00:09:45.71,00:09:47.31
Because if you. . . .[br]You should--

00:09:47.55,00:09:49.54
You would tell me.

00:09:51.07,00:09:53.87
Why are your eyes so wide?

00:09:54.51,00:09:55.66
You tell me.

00:09:56.63,00:09:59.63
Maybe it's because I was just[br]fooling around with my ex.

00:09:59.87,00:10:01.59
Oh, no. That was you!

00:10:01.91,00:10:02.87
Oh, my God!

00:10:03.11,00:10:04.87
-All right![br]-How did you know?

00:10:05.11,00:10:07.26
Joey told me. He saw you two kissing.

00:10:07.47,00:10:08.27
In the park?

00:10:09.99,00:10:12.67
No. In his office.[br]How many kisses were there?

00:10:12.91,00:10:13.87
Just those two!

00:10:14.11,00:10:15.47
Why?

00:10:15.71,00:10:18.31
Why was there kissing?[br]There should be no kissing!

00:10:18.55,00:10:21.59
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.[br]I'm so, so. . . .

00:10:22.31,00:10:24.30
I'm so, so sorry. I just. . . .

00:10:26.27,00:10:28.91
What happened was l. . . .[br]I can't breathe.

00:10:29.23,00:10:31.83
Can you get me a bag or something?

00:10:32.71,00:10:33.91
Here. Here.

00:10:38.67,00:10:39.50
It's the receipt.

00:10:39.75,00:10:40.66
I'll take it.

00:10:42.31,00:10:43.95
Look, I've got to know.

00:10:46.83,00:10:48.27
Are you finished with me?

00:10:51.03,00:10:52.71
Are you finished with him?

00:10:56.67,00:10:58.63
Do you still love him?

00:11:01.63,00:11:03.07
Do you still love me?

00:11:05.03,00:11:06.18
All right, look. . .

00:11:07.23,00:11:09.67
. . .I'm gonna need an actual[br]answer here, okay?

00:11:09.91,00:11:11.55
So which is it?

00:11:13.03,00:11:14.43
Him or me?

00:11:23.11,00:11:24.75
I don't know.

00:11:27.11,00:11:30.19
Okay, if you're alive,[br]you answer your phone!

00:11:35.79,00:11:39.99
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy[br]that you had ice cream before dinner. . .

00:11:40.23,00:11:43.83
. . .if you won't tell him about[br]our little bonking incident.

00:11:44.03,00:11:47.23
Number one, I don't think Ben[br]understands the concept of bribery.

00:11:47.47,00:11:49.23
And number two, l--

00:11:51.35,00:11:52.15
What?

00:11:52.51,00:11:54.63
You said "number two. "

00:11:57.51,00:11:58.83
I also said "number one. "

00:11:59.63,00:12:00.51
I know.

00:12:03.31,00:12:04.35
Hey, everyone!

00:12:04.59,00:12:06.63
How's my little boy?

00:12:06.83,00:12:08.43
He's perfect.[br]Aren't you, Ben?

00:12:08.67,00:12:12.22
-He's never been better.[br]-What did you do, take him whaling?

00:12:14.31,00:12:15.27
Monica.

00:12:15.51,00:12:19.83
Oh, my God! He just said your name![br]That's great! Good job, Ben!

00:12:20.63,00:12:21.78
Monica bang!

00:12:23.11,00:12:24.02
That's right.

00:12:24.23,00:12:27.03
That's what I'd sound like[br]if I exploded.

00:12:28.91,00:12:31.35
The curse is broken![br]I called everybody I know. . .

00:12:31.59,00:12:33.42
. . .and everyone is alive!

00:12:38.47,00:12:41.11
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.

00:12:47.07,00:12:48.71
My God, I killed another one!

00:12:48.95,00:12:52.79
The curse is getting stronger too,[br]to bring down something that big.

00:12:53.11,00:12:54.94
Maybe he's just taking a nap.

00:12:55.19,00:12:57.63
I'm telling you,[br]he hasn't moved since this morning.

00:12:57.87,00:12:59.27
We should call somebody.

00:12:59.51,00:13:02.55
Tell them the naked guy we stare at[br]isn't moving?

00:13:02.79,00:13:04.86
We've got to find out if he's alive.

00:13:05.11,00:13:07.42
How are we gonna do that?[br]There's no way.

00:13:07.63,00:13:09.23
Well, there is one way.

00:13:09.51,00:13:12.15
His window's open.[br]I say. . .

00:13:12.39,00:13:13.54
. . .we poke him.

00:13:19.19,00:13:21.55
You know how we save[br]all those chopsticks. . .

00:13:21.79,00:13:24.23
. . .for no reason[br]when we get Chinese food?

00:13:25.63,00:13:27.51
Well, now we got a reason.

00:13:28.71,00:13:29.59
What?

00:13:29.83,00:13:32.71
We're fashioning a very long[br]poking device.

00:13:34.59,00:13:35.63
All right.

00:13:38.51,00:13:40.11
Hey, what's the matter?

00:13:43.03,00:13:44.67
I talked to Janice.

00:13:44.99,00:13:47.55
Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?

00:13:48.19,00:13:49.75
She doesn't know.

00:13:49.99,00:13:51.39
Says she loves us both.

00:13:53.03,00:13:55.59
I woke up this morning, I was in love.

00:13:55.91,00:13:57.43
I was happy!

00:13:59.11,00:14:01.75
It serves me right for buying[br]that 1 2-pack of condoms.

00:14:03.99,00:14:07.62
And now I can't even return them,[br]because she choked on the receipt!

00:14:10.71,00:14:12.86
What are you gonna do?

00:14:15.59,00:14:16.71
I don't know.

00:14:17.99,00:14:19.82
You know? What would you do?

00:14:22.31,00:14:23.95
It doesn't matter what I'd do.

00:14:24.19,00:14:25.87
Come on. Come on. Tell me.

00:14:28.67,00:14:30.11
All right. . .

00:14:31.51,00:14:33.34
. . .you probably won't want[br]to hear this. . .

00:14:36.47,00:14:39.59
. . .but if it was me,[br]and this is just me. . .

00:14:40.15,00:14:40.95
. . .I'd bow out.

00:14:41.15,00:14:41.95
What?

00:14:44.51,00:14:46.31
What are you talking about?

00:14:49.39,00:14:51.03
They have a kid together. . .

00:14:51.23,00:14:52.35
. . .you know?

00:14:53.83,00:14:55.51
They're, like, a family.

00:14:56.43,00:14:58.07
And if, I don't know. . .

00:14:58.31,00:15:01.54
. . .if there's a chance[br]they can make that work. . .

00:15:01.79,00:15:04.51
. . .I wouldn't want to be the guy[br]who stood in the way.

00:15:09.03,00:15:10.18
You okay?

00:15:14.15,00:15:15.83
You wanna come poke a nude guy?

00:15:18.91,00:15:21.27
Well, he's finally asleep.

00:15:21.91,00:15:24.67
About that bump on his head. . . .

00:15:25.91,00:15:28.14
Are you sure it's a new bump?

00:15:28.39,00:15:32.43
No offense, but I've always thought[br]of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.

00:15:32.79,00:15:36.07
It's okay if he bumps his head.[br]Kids bump their heads all the time.

00:15:36.31,00:15:39.11
It was your first time babysitting.[br]You did your best.

00:15:39.63,00:15:40.62
I did!

00:15:40.83,00:15:41.63
I know.

00:15:41.83,00:15:44.03
You just have to watch them[br]all the time.

00:15:44.23,00:15:46.87
I did! I watched! I watched!

00:15:47.11,00:15:50.19
I watched Monica bang his head[br]against that thing!

00:15:51.27,00:15:52.18
Monica did it?

00:15:57.71,00:16:01.42
Did you notice anything weird[br]about Ben today?

00:16:02.67,00:16:03.63
No, why?

00:16:03.87,00:16:07.63
I was just playing with him, and we[br]were doing the "Alphabet Song" . . .

00:16:07.83,00:16:10.63
. . .which he's good at.[br]But he left out "E" and "F. "

00:16:10.87,00:16:14.39
It's like they just, I don't know,[br]fell out of his head.

00:16:16.79,00:16:17.83
Really?

00:16:18.03,00:16:21.07
Oh, and also, he's walking. . .

00:16:21.63,00:16:22.75
. . .kind of funny.

00:16:24.35,00:16:28.63
It's like his left leg is moving[br]a lot faster than his right leg.

00:16:28.87,00:16:30.55
Yeah, he's in there, just. . . .

00:16:34.27,00:16:36.95
Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!

00:16:39.79,00:16:42.15
I hope it's still funny[br]when you're in hell.

00:16:43.51,00:16:44.58
You jerk!

00:16:44.79,00:16:49.42
-You know how much I love that kid![br]-Monica bang! Monica bang!

00:16:52.63,00:16:53.95
I'll get the hat.

00:16:58.31,00:17:00.07
I have something to tell you.

00:17:00.31,00:17:02.43
And I want you to let me[br]get through it. . .

00:17:02.67,00:17:03.95
. . .because. . .

00:17:04.91,00:17:07.27
. . .it's not gonna be easy.

00:17:11.47,00:17:13.54
I think you should go back with Gary.

00:17:15.47,00:17:18.23
I don't want to be the guy[br]that breaks up a family.

00:17:19.03,00:17:22.34
You know, when my parents split up,[br]it was because of that guy.

00:17:22.59,00:17:24.66
Whenever I'd see him,[br]I'd always think. . .

00:17:24.91,00:17:28.27
. . . "You're the reason.[br]You are why they're not together. "

00:17:28.51,00:17:30.58
And I hated that guy.

00:17:32.43,00:17:37.11
And it didn't matter how nice he was[br]or how happy he made my dad.

00:17:47.31,00:17:48.99
It's the right thing to do.

00:17:50.11,00:17:51.31
You're right.

00:17:52.67,00:17:56.99
Oh, God.[br]But before I can say goodbye. . .

00:17:58.31,00:18:01.43
. . .there's something I really[br]need you to know.

00:18:01.91,00:18:04.43
The way I feel about you. . .

00:18:04.71,00:18:07.67
. . .it's like I finally understand. . .

00:18:07.91,00:18:10.14
. . .what Lionel Ritchie's[br]been singing about.

00:18:11.71,00:18:13.43
You know?[br]I mean, what we have. . .

00:18:13.67,00:18:16.47
. . .it's like movie love.

00:18:17.67,00:18:19.50
You're my soul mate.

00:18:20.51,00:18:24.63
I can't believe we're not gonna[br]spend the rest of our lives together.

00:18:26.39,00:18:27.99
Then don't leave me.

00:18:29.35,00:18:30.15
What?

00:18:30.39,00:18:33.23
Forget what I said! I was babbling![br]Pick me!

00:18:33.43,00:18:36.95
No, you were right! I gotta give[br]my marriage another chance.

00:18:37.59,00:18:38.99
No, you don't!

00:18:39.75,00:18:42.83
I say you have to give your divorce[br]another chance!

00:18:45.63,00:18:46.91
I'm sorry.

00:18:52.07,00:18:53.30
Don't go.

00:18:53.87,00:18:55.59
No, I gotta go.

00:18:59.87,00:19:01.19
Honey. Honey.

00:19:02.07,00:19:04.35
-People are looking.[br]-I don't care.

00:19:05.23,00:19:06.75
I don't care!

00:19:07.31,00:19:08.67
Yeah, okay.

00:19:10.07,00:19:11.30
I'm leaving now.

00:19:14.03,00:19:16.50
You can't leave! I have your shoe!

00:19:20.11,00:19:22.34
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.

00:19:33.35,00:19:35.03
Rachel has those in burgundy.

00:19:38.67,00:19:43.19
Remember, something this big and long[br]will be very difficult to maneuver.

00:19:43.39,00:19:46.03
Fortunately, I have[br]experience in that area.

00:19:46.79,00:19:51.26
Can we please focus here? A naked[br]man's life hangs in the balance.

00:19:51.51,00:19:52.83
I'm telling you, he's dead.

00:19:53.03,00:19:56.34
What we're about to have here[br]is a dead fat guy on a stick!

00:19:57.27,00:20:00.03
All right, ladies and gentlemen,[br]let's poke.

00:20:00.23,00:20:01.06
Steady.

00:20:01.31,00:20:02.43
Steady.

00:20:03.11,00:20:04.39
Okay, a little higher.

00:20:05.31,00:20:06.79
Careful of the angle.

00:20:06.99,00:20:09.55
Okay, okay.[br]We're approaching the window.

00:20:13.39,00:20:15.75
Thread the needle. Thread the needle.

00:20:21.23,00:20:23.79
He's alive! He's alive!

00:20:25.79,00:20:28.02
And yet we're still poking him.

00:20:28.27,00:20:30.83
Okay, retract the device![br]Retract the device!

00:20:31.35,00:20:33.23
He does not look happy.

00:20:34.07,00:20:36.99
Now he's showing us his poking device.

00:20:38.07,00:20:41.62
Hey, that's never gonna make it[br]all the way over here, buddy!

00:20:47.91,00:20:52.27
I'll hold you close in my arms

00:20:53.63,00:20:57.55
I can 't resist your charms

00:20:58.51,00:21:00.03
And love

00:21:00.23,00:21:02.03
Love

00:21:03.43,00:21:08.14
I'll be a fool for you

00:21:08.47,00:21:10.51
I'm sure

00:21:11.71,00:21:14.75
You know I don 't mind

00:21:14.99,00:21:17.55
Oh, you know I don 't mind

00:21:18.11,00:21:19.63
Yes

00:21:19.91,00:21:23.83
You mean the world to me

00:21:24.47,00:21:27.43
Oh, I know[br]I know

00:21:27.67,00:21:30.14
I've found[br]I've found

00:21:30.39,00:21:31.71
In you

00:21:33.11,00:21:36.55
My endless love

00:21:38.99,00:21:42.07
My endless love

-Oh, I don't know.[br]-What?

00:00:06.49,00:00:08.77
Well, as old as he is[br]in dog years. . .

00:00:09.01,00:00:12.32
. . .do you think Snoopy should[br]still be flying this thing?

00:00:12.89,00:00:13.72
Rachel?

00:00:13.93,00:00:14.73
Yeah?

00:00:14.93,00:00:18.64
Remember when you first came here and[br]you got trained by another waitress?

00:00:18.85,00:00:21.45
Sure! Do you need me[br]to train somebody new?

00:00:22.89,00:00:23.85
Good one.

00:00:25.01,00:00:28.77
Actually, Terry wants you[br]to take the training again.

00:00:29.01,00:00:29.92
Whenever.

00:00:33.53,00:00:35.09
Do you believe that?

00:00:40.53,00:00:41.44
Yeah.

So that's two boxes[br]of the Holiday Macaroons.

00:01:35.09,00:01:38.05
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America,[br]I salute you.

00:01:40.97,00:01:43.33
Just admit it. You have no backhand.

00:01:43.57,00:01:46.45
Excuse me, little one.[br]I have a very solid backhand.

00:01:46.69,00:01:49.77
Shielding your face[br]and shrieking like a girl. . .

00:01:50.01,00:01:51.69
. . .is not a backhand.

00:01:53.21,00:01:54.77

00:01:58.21,00:02:02.49
All right, watch me execute[br]the three P's of championship play.

00:02:11.61,00:02:13.37
You broke a little girl's leg?

00:02:14.01,00:02:16.13
I know. I feel horrible, okay?

00:02:16.37,00:02:20.33
It says here that a Muppet got whacked[br]on Sesame Street last night.

00:02:21.33,00:02:23.93
Where exactly were you around 1 0-ish?

00:02:25.69,00:02:28.53
I'm going to see her.[br]I wanna bring her something.

00:02:28.73,00:02:31.17
-What would she like?[br]-A Hello Kitty doll?

00:02:31.41,00:02:33.37
The ability to walk?

00:02:36.97,00:02:38.93
I'm gonna get back to retraining.

00:02:39.13,00:02:41.05
All right. See you, guys.

00:02:41.25,00:02:42.97
Look out, kids! He's coming!

00:02:46.09,00:02:48.05
I gotta go sell Christmas trees.

00:02:48.29,00:02:50.73
Have fun.[br]Oh, wait! No, don't!

00:02:50.93,00:02:53.93
I forgot. I am totally[br]against that now.

00:02:54.97,00:02:56.93
What? Me having a job?

00:02:57.73,00:03:01.97
No, I am against innocent trees[br]being cut down in their prime. . .

00:03:02.21,00:03:04.93
. . .and their corpses[br]grotesquely dressed. . .

00:03:05.13,00:03:07.65
. . .in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

00:03:08.29,00:03:10.05
How do you sleep at night?

00:03:10.37,00:03:13.53
Well, I'm pretty tired[br]from lugging the trees around.

00:03:15.93,00:03:20.37
You got this all wrong. Those trees[br]were born to be Christmas trees.

00:03:20.61,00:03:24.57
They're fulfilling their life purpose[br]by making people happy.

00:03:25.05,00:03:25.85
Really?

00:03:28.01,00:03:28.84
Yes!

00:03:30.09,00:03:32.24
Yes, and the trees are happy too. . .

00:03:32.49,00:03:34.56
. . .because for most of them,[br]it's their only. . .

00:03:34.81,00:03:36.33
. . .chance to see New York.

00:03:40.09,00:03:42.37
After you deliver the drinks,[br]take the tray--

00:03:42.61,00:03:45.97
Gunther, please. I have worked here[br]for two and a half years.

00:03:46.21,00:03:48.77
I know the empty trays go over there.

00:03:48.97,00:03:50.89
What if you put them here?

00:03:53.77,00:03:56.97
That's actually a good idea.[br]They'll be closer to the mugs.

00:03:57.21,00:03:59.57
You should have the other[br]waitresses do that too.

00:04:01.01,00:04:02.33
They already do.

00:04:03.41,00:04:05.64
That's why they call it the tray spot.

00:04:06.13,00:04:10.84
I heard them talk about that. I just[br]thought it was a club they went to.

00:04:13.01,00:04:15.32
-I'm sorry.[br]-It's all right.

00:04:16.97,00:04:18.29
Sweetheart.

00:04:21.21,00:04:24.65
So this must be kind of neat[br]for you, huh?

00:04:24.89,00:04:27.12
Your dad tells me[br]you get school off. . .

00:04:27.33,00:04:30.53
. . .and you don't have to sell[br]those cookies anymore.

00:04:32.01,00:04:34.13
I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.

00:04:34.33,00:04:36.97
Whoever sells the most[br]wins a trip to Space Camp. . .

00:04:37.17,00:04:39.17
. . .and gets to sit in a real shuttle.

00:04:39.41,00:04:43.77
You really like[br]all this space stuff, huh?

00:04:44.01,00:04:47.37
My dad says if I'd spend as much[br]time helping him clean apartments. . .

00:04:47.61,00:04:49.92
. . .as I do daydreaming[br]about outer space. . .

00:04:50.17,00:04:52.77
. . .he'd be able to afford a trip[br]to the Taj Mahal.

00:04:53.17,00:04:56.96
You'd have to clean a lot of apartments[br]to go all the way to lndia.

00:04:57.21,00:05:00.21
No. The one in Atlantic City.[br]Dad loves the slots.

00:05:02.41,00:05:05.53
He says he'll double the college[br]money Grandma left me.

00:05:08.13,00:05:10.33
Well, good luck to Dad.

00:05:12.37,00:05:16.73
Say, how many more boxes would you[br]have to sell in order to win?

00:05:16.93,00:05:21.01
The girl who won last year sold 475.

00:05:21.25,00:05:23.97
So far, I've sold 75.

00:05:26.61,00:05:27.97
Four hundred, huh?

00:05:29.09,00:05:32.33
Well, that sounds doable.[br]How much are the boxes?

00:05:32.53,00:05:33.60
Five dollars a box.

00:05:34.33,00:05:36.40
And what is second prize?

00:05:37.33,00:05:41.09
A 1 0-speed bike. But I'd rather have[br]something my dad couldn't sell.

00:05:43.77,00:05:45.13
Well, that makes sense.

00:05:45.61,00:05:47.76
Could you do me one favor?

00:05:48.01,00:05:49.53
Yeah, Sarah. Anything.

00:05:49.77,00:05:51.57
Could you pull the curtains open?

00:05:51.81,00:05:54.45
The shuttle astronauts[br]are gonna be on the news.

00:05:54.69,00:05:56.92
We don't have a Tv,[br]so the lady across the alley. . .

00:05:57.13,00:06:00.33
. . .said she'd push hers up[br]to her window so I can watch it.

00:06:12.49,00:06:13.56
Yes?

00:06:13.81,00:06:16.33
Hi. I'm selling[br]Brown Bird cookies.

00:06:16.57,00:06:21.05
You're no Brown Bird.[br]I can see you through my peephole.

00:06:22.21,00:06:25.33
Hi. I'm an honorary Brown Bird.

00:06:29.21,00:06:30.36
What does that mean?

00:06:30.61,00:06:35.45
It means that I can sell cookies,[br]but I'm not invited to sleepovers.

00:06:39.33,00:06:41.85
I can dial 91 1 at the press[br]of a button, you know.

00:06:42.09,00:06:43.32
Now, go away!

00:06:43.53,00:06:46.25
Please, please.[br]It's for a poor little girl. . .

00:06:46.49,00:06:49.77
. . .who wants to go to Space Camp[br]more than anything in the world.

00:06:50.01,00:06:51.33
I'm pressing.

00:06:51.53,00:06:53.41
A policeman is on his way.

00:06:53.65,00:06:56.21
Okay, okay![br]I'm going, I'm going.

00:07:01.21,00:07:02.53
I can still see you!

00:07:02.73,00:07:03.80
All right!

00:07:09.89,00:07:13.57
-What are you doing here?[br]-I thought a lot about what you said. . .

00:07:13.81,00:07:17.25
. . .and I realize maybe[br]I was a little judgmental.

00:07:17.49,00:07:19.33
Yeah. Oh, but, oh.

00:07:19.69,00:07:21.69
Now, now, Phoebe, remember. . .

00:07:22.21,00:07:24.33
. . .they're just fulfilling[br]their Christmas--

00:07:24.53,00:07:25.89
-Destiny. Yes.[br]-Sure.

00:07:29.21,00:07:31.93
That one doesn't look[br]very fulfilled.

00:07:32.21,00:07:35.33
That's one of the old ones.[br]He's just taking it to the back.

00:07:35.53,00:07:37.73
You keep the old ones in the back?

00:07:37.93,00:07:39.57
That is so ageist.

00:07:41.21,00:07:42.85
We're making room for the fresh ones.

00:07:43.41,00:07:45.33
So what happens to the old guys?

00:07:45.89,00:07:47.25
They go into the chipper.

00:07:48.69,00:07:51.53
I have a feeling that's not[br]as happy as it sounds.

00:08:08.13,00:08:10.52
These are shaped like[br]Christmas characters.

00:08:10.73,00:08:13.25
Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.

00:08:15.01,00:08:17.61
I'll take a box of the[br]cream-filled Jesuses.

00:08:19.17,00:08:22.37
One box? I'm trying to send[br]a little girl to Space Camp.

00:08:22.61,00:08:25.33
I'm putting you down for 5 boxes.[br]What about you?

00:08:25.57,00:08:29.09
All right. Do you have any[br]coconut-flavored deities?

00:08:29.93,00:08:33.81
No, but there's coconut in the[br]Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

00:08:34.81,00:08:37.41
I'll put you down for 8 boxes.[br]One for each night.

00:08:38.61,00:08:39.41
Mon?

00:08:39.93,00:08:42.13
I'll take a box of the Mint Treasures.

00:08:42.37,00:08:43.73
One, and that's it.

00:08:43.93,00:08:46.21
I gained weight after[br]I joined the Brown Birds.

00:08:46.41,00:08:50.29
Remember? Dad bought every one[br]of my boxes and I ate them all.

00:08:51.25,00:08:54.05
No, Mon. Dad had to buy[br]every one of your boxes. . .

00:08:54.29,00:08:56.13
. . .because you ate them all.

00:08:58.41,00:09:02.61
But, you know, I'm sure that's[br]not gonna happen this time.

00:09:03.21,00:09:07.57
Why don't I put you down for 3 Mint[br]Treasures and a couple of Rudolphs?

00:09:07.81,00:09:08.85
No.

00:09:11.21,00:09:13.85
Oh, come on, now.[br]You know you want them.

00:09:14.73,00:09:16.57
Don't do this.

00:09:16.81,00:09:20.93
I'll tell you what,[br]I'll give you the first box for free.

00:09:22.41,00:09:23.93
Oh, God! I gotta go!

00:09:24.13,00:09:26.65
Come on! All the cool kids[br]are eating them.

00:09:29.17,00:09:32.17
And later, I'll show you why[br]we don't just trap spiders. . .

00:09:32.41,00:09:34.93
. . .under coffee mugs[br]and leave them there.

00:09:38.21,00:09:42.45
I'm training to be better at a job[br]that I hate. My life officially sucks!

00:09:42.69,00:09:46.32
Wasn't this supposed to be temporary?[br]You wanted to do fashion stuff.

00:09:46.57,00:09:48.77
Yeah, I'm still pursuing that.

00:09:49.33,00:09:51.77
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?

00:09:52.01,00:09:55.72
Other than sending out resumes,[br]like, what? Two years ago?

00:09:56.41,00:09:59.01
Well, I'm also sending out. . .

00:09:59.61,00:10:01.17
. . .good thoughts.

00:10:02.73,00:10:05.37
If you ask me, as long as you[br]got this job. . .

00:10:05.61,00:10:08.13
. . .you got nothing pushing you[br]to get another one.

00:10:08.37,00:10:09.97
You need The Fear.

00:10:10.81,00:10:12.21
-The Fear?[br]-He's right.

00:10:12.45,00:10:16.93
Quit this job, and you'll have motivation[br]to go after a job you really want.

00:10:17.17,00:10:21.61
Why are you still at a job you hate?[br]Why don't you quit and get The Fear?

00:10:22.81,00:10:25.04
Because I'm too afraid.

00:10:26.81,00:10:31.68
I don't know. I'd give anything[br]to work for a designer or a buyer.

00:10:32.57,00:10:34.85
I just don't want to be 30[br]and still work here.

00:10:35.09,00:10:39.37
Yeah, that'd be much worse than[br]being 28 and still working here.

00:10:41.93,00:10:45.93
Remind me to review with you which[br]pot is decaf and which is regular.

00:10:47.37,00:10:49.73
Can't I just look at the handles[br]on them?

00:10:49.93,00:10:51.25
You would think.

00:10:52.21,00:10:56.13
Okay, fine. Gunther, you know what?[br]I am a terrible waitress.

00:10:56.37,00:11:00.05
Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?[br]Because I don't care.

00:11:00.61,00:11:03.61
I don't care which pot[br]is regular and which pot is decaf.

00:11:03.85,00:11:05.53
I don't care where the tray spot is.

00:11:05.77,00:11:08.61
I just don't care.[br]This is not what I want to do.

00:11:10.01,00:11:12.37
So I don't think I should do it anymore.

00:11:14.09,00:11:16.37
-I'm giving my week's notice.[br]-What?

00:11:16.61,00:11:17.73
Gunther, I quit.

00:11:20.41,00:11:23.13
Does this mean we have to start[br]paying for coffee?

00:11:28.41,00:11:29.69
Okay, 1 2.

00:11:30.53,00:11:31.76
Twenty-two.

00:11:32.41,00:11:33.56
Eighteen.

00:11:38.41,00:11:39.21
What?

00:11:39.41,00:11:41.13
I spelled out "boobies" .

00:11:45.49,00:11:49.04
Put me down for another box[br]of the Mint Treasures, okay?

00:11:49.41,00:11:51.13
Where are the Mint Treasures?

00:11:52.57,00:11:54.49
We're out. I sold them all.

00:11:55.05,00:11:55.93
What?

00:11:56.81,00:11:58.93
Monica, I'm cutting you off.

00:12:04.53,00:12:06.17
Just a couple more boxes.

00:12:08.05,00:12:10.28
It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.

00:12:12.17,00:12:14.73
You gotta help me[br]with a couple more boxes!

00:12:15.81,00:12:18.17
Look at yourself.[br]You have cookie on your neck.

00:12:18.73,00:12:19.61
Oh, God!

00:12:22.57,00:12:25.45
-So how many you sold so far?[br]-Check this out.

00:12:25.69,00:12:29.73
-Five hundred and seventeen boxes![br]-Oh, my God! How did you do that?

00:12:29.97,00:12:32.04
The other night I was leaving[br]the museum. . .

00:12:32.29,00:12:36.33
. . .just as Laser Floyd was letting out[br]of the planetarium.

00:12:36.73,00:12:39.33
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes!

00:12:39.57,00:12:43.01
That's when it occurred to me.[br]The key to my success: The munchies.

00:12:44.77,00:12:49.13
So I started hitting the NYU dorms[br]around midnight.

00:12:51.01,00:12:53.53
I am selling cookies by the case.

00:12:54.29,00:12:57.33
They call me "Cookie Dude" !

00:12:59.41,00:13:03.17
Stop what you're doing. I need[br]envelope stuffers, stamp lickers. . . .

00:13:03.41,00:13:06.93
-Who did these resumes for you?[br]-Me. On my computer.

00:13:07.17,00:13:08.93
You sure used a large font.

00:13:09.21,00:13:12.13
Yeah. Well, "Waitress at[br]a Coffeehouse" . . .

00:13:12.33,00:13:15.33
. . .and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain"[br]only took up so much room.

00:13:17.01,00:13:18.29
Hey, that's funny!

00:13:18.53,00:13:20.97
You're funny, Chandler![br]You're a funny guy!

00:13:21.21,00:13:22.97
You know what else is funny?

00:13:23.61,00:13:26.05
Something else I might have said?

00:13:26.89,00:13:30.13
I don't know. Weren't you the guy[br]that told me to quit my job. . .

00:13:30.37,00:13:33.13
. . .when I had absolutely[br]nothing else to do?

00:13:36.65,00:13:38.13
Calm down. It's gonna be okay.

00:13:38.33,00:13:41.57
No, it's not gonna be okay.[br]Tomorrow is my last day. . .

00:13:41.81,00:13:43.69
. . .and I don't have a lead.

00:13:44.17,00:13:46.37
You know what?[br]I'm just gonna call Gunther. . .

00:13:46.61,00:13:48.33
. . .and tell him I'm not quitting.

00:13:48.57,00:13:50.93
You don't want to give in to The Fear.

00:13:51.13,00:13:54.33
You and your stupid Fear![br]I hate your Fear!

00:13:54.57,00:13:56.85
I would like to take[br]you and your Fear--

00:13:57.09,00:13:59.24
Hey! I got great news!

00:13:59.49,00:14:01.72
Run, Joey! Run for your life!

00:14:03.77,00:14:07.21
What? Rach, listen. Have you ever[br]heard of Fortunata Fashions?

00:14:08.45,00:14:11.73
My dad's got a plumbing job there[br]and he heard there's an opening.

00:14:11.97,00:14:13.77
You want him to get you an interview?

00:14:14.01,00:14:17.77
Oh, my God, yes! I would love that![br]That's so sweet, Joey.

00:14:18.17,00:14:19.13
Not a problem.

00:14:19.33,00:14:21.56
And now, for the great news.

00:14:21.81,00:14:23.37
That wasn't the great news?

00:14:23.61,00:14:25.41
Only if you think[br]it's better than this.

00:14:26.09,00:14:27.41
Snow-in-a-Can!

00:14:29.21,00:14:31.33
You want me to decorate the window?

00:14:31.53,00:14:33.37
Give it kind of a Christmas looky?

00:14:33.81,00:14:35.17
Christmas cookie?

00:14:40.57,00:14:42.77
Okay, and this one here's[br]a Douglas fir.

00:14:43.01,00:14:46.25
Now, it's a little more money,[br]but you get a nicer smell.

00:14:47.33,00:14:48.93
Looks good. I'll take it.

00:14:49.17,00:14:51.32
Wait, wait. No, no![br]You don't want that one!

00:14:51.57,00:14:54.45
No, no. You can have[br]this cool brown one.

00:14:56.09,00:14:57.89
It's almost dead.

00:14:58.49,00:15:02.04
That's why you have to buy it,[br]to fulfill its Christmas destiny.

00:15:02.29,00:15:05.53
Otherwise, they'll throw it[br]into the chipper. Tell him.

00:15:06.53,00:15:10.13
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill[br]their Christmas destiny. . .

00:15:10.33,00:15:12.13
. . .are thrown in the chipper.

00:15:13.37,00:15:16.45
I think I'm gonna look around[br]a little bit more.

00:15:17.21,00:15:21.05
You gotta stop doing this.[br]I'm working on commission here!

00:15:22.69,00:15:24.73
I'm here to pick out[br]my Christmas tree.

00:15:24.93,00:15:27.97
Well, look no further![br]This one's yours!

00:15:30.81,00:15:33.33
Is this the one[br]that I threw out last year?

00:15:34.69,00:15:38.69
Never mind![br]Everybody wants a green one!

00:15:38.89,00:15:42.44
I'm sorry. I didn't mean[br]to get so emotional.

00:15:42.89,00:15:44.69
The holidays are just hard.

00:15:45.01,00:15:48.40
Oh, honey. Is that because[br]your mom died around Christmas?

00:15:48.65,00:15:50.88
I wasn't even thinking about that.

00:16:00.01,00:16:02.93
Hi there.[br]How many did you sell?

00:16:03.13,00:16:07.13
I'm not gonna tell you. You're the[br]bad man who broke Sarah's leg.

00:16:08.93,00:16:11.21
Hey, now. That was an accident, okay?

00:16:11.57,00:16:12.61
You're a big scrud.

00:16:14.73,00:16:16.13
What's a scrud?

00:16:16.33,00:16:18.33
Why don't you look[br]in the mirror, scrud?

00:16:20.49,00:16:23.29
I don't have to.[br]I can just look at you.

00:16:25.09,00:16:26.13
All right, girls. . .

00:16:27.33,00:16:28.65
. . .and man.

00:16:29.97,00:16:32.12
Let's see your final tallies.

00:16:33.17,00:16:34.05
Debbie.

00:16:35.45,00:16:38.65
Three hundred and twenty-one[br]boxes of cookies. very nice.

00:16:39.17,00:16:40.69
Not nice enough.

00:16:41.89,00:16:43.01
Charla.

00:16:43.25,00:16:45.13
Two hundred and seventy-eight.

00:16:45.37,00:16:47.13
Sorry, dear, but still good.

00:16:47.49,00:16:49.29
Good for a scrud.

00:16:52.69,00:16:54.13
Yes, Elizabeth.

00:16:55.09,00:16:57.29
Eight hundred and seventy-one.

00:16:57.49,00:16:58.81
That's crap!

00:17:02.57,00:17:04.13
Sister Brown Bird.

00:17:05.09,00:17:06.24
Good going.

00:17:09.01,00:17:10.65
Who's next?

00:17:15.21,00:17:16.89
-Hi there.[br]-Hi.

00:17:18.29,00:17:20.29
And batting for Sarah. . .

00:17:21.09,00:17:22.57
. . .Ross Geller.

00:17:23.49,00:17:25.72
Eight hundred and seventy-two.

00:17:27.61,00:17:31.69
Although, it looks like you bought[br]an awful lot of cookies yourself.

00:17:32.01,00:17:35.25
That is because my doctor[br]says that I have. . .

00:17:35.49,00:17:37.45
. . .a very serious. . .

00:17:38.53,00:17:39.89
. . .nougat. . .

00:17:41.97,00:17:43.49
. . .deficiency.

00:17:45.29,00:17:47.93
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.

00:17:49.21,00:17:53.33
I lost. Some little girl loaned[br]her uniform to her 1 9-year-old sister. . .

00:17:53.53,00:17:58.16
. . .who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz[br]and sold over 2000 boxes.

00:18:00.13,00:18:03.05
-How'd the interview go?[br]-Oh, I blew it.

00:18:03.29,00:18:05.33
I wouldn't have even hired me.

00:18:06.17,00:18:07.16
Come here, sweetie.

00:18:07.41,00:18:08.48
Listen. . .

00:18:08.81,00:18:13.49
. . .you're gonna go on, like,[br]1 000 interviews before you get a job.

00:18:17.49,00:18:20.33
That's not how that was supposed[br]to come out.

00:18:20.57,00:18:22.85
This is just the worst Christmas ever.

00:18:23.09,00:18:26.05
Maybe you should just[br]stay here at the coffeehouse.

00:18:26.29,00:18:30.17
I can't. It's too late. Terry already[br]hired that girl over there.

00:18:30.41,00:18:31.45
Look at her.

00:18:31.69,00:18:34.53
She's even got waitress experience.

00:18:35.01,00:18:36.61
Last night she was. . .

00:18:37.01,00:18:38.85
. . .teaching everybody[br]how to make. . .

00:18:39.09,00:18:40.32
. . .napkins. . .

00:18:40.57,00:18:41.37
. . .into. . . .

00:18:45.17,00:18:46.69
That word was "swans. "

00:18:51.49,00:18:55.93
Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet[br]himself really perked up my Christmas.

00:19:03.85,00:19:05.13
Oh, my God!

00:19:06.01,00:19:07.33
Merry Christmas!

00:19:08.81,00:19:10.96
You saved them![br]You guys!

00:19:11.21,00:19:13.01
Oh, God, you're the best!

00:19:13.25,00:19:16.37
Looks like Night of the[br]Living Dead Christmas Trees.

00:19:20.97,00:19:22.09
Yeah, this is she.

00:19:24.73,00:19:26.69
You're kidding! You're kidding!

00:19:27.37,00:19:29.21
Oh, thank you! I love you!

00:19:29.41,00:19:31.61
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.

00:19:31.93,00:19:33.33
I got the job!

00:19:33.53,00:19:35.76
That's great.

00:19:36.13,00:19:38.89
God bless us, everyone!

00:19:41.37,00:19:45.21
Here we go. I'm serving[br]my last cup of coffee.

00:19:52.37,00:19:53.44
There you go.

00:19:53.69,00:19:54.89
Enjoy.

00:19:58.01,00:20:00.16
-Should I tell her I ordered tea?[br]-No.

00:20:01.89,00:20:03.04
Excuse me, everyone?

00:20:04.33,00:20:06.40
This is my last night working here. . .

00:20:06.65,00:20:09.37
. . .and I just wanted to say. . .

00:20:09.61,00:20:11.76
. . .that I made some good friends here.

00:20:12.01,00:20:14.57
And it's just time to move on.

00:20:18.29,00:20:21.17
And no offense to everybody[br]who still works here. . .

00:20:21.41,00:20:24.72
. . .but you have no idea how good[br]it feels to say. . .

00:20:24.93,00:20:27.32
. . .that as of this moment. . .

00:20:27.53,00:20:32.13
. . .I will never have[br]to make coffee again.

00:20:32.33,00:20:34.97
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr.[br]Iikes his coffee strong.

00:20:35.21,00:20:38.41
So you want to use two bags[br]instead of one.

00:20:38.65,00:20:41.25
Now, pay attention.[br]This part's tricky.

00:20:41.73,00:20:44.77
See, some people use filters[br]just once. . . .

00:20:53.81,00:20:56.37
I'm sorry you didn't get to go[br]to Space Camp. . .

00:20:56.61,00:21:01.48
. . .and I'm hoping that maybe somehow[br]this may help make up for it. Okay?

00:21:02.09,00:21:03.37
Presenting. . .

00:21:03.61,00:21:07.53
. . .Sarah Tuddle's[br]Private very Special Space Camp!

00:21:11.57,00:21:13.33
You don't have to do this.

00:21:13.53,00:21:15.49
Oh, come on, here we go!

00:21:16.49,00:21:19.53
Stand by for mission countdown!

00:21:20.57,00:21:21.56
Ten.

00:21:21.81,00:21:22.96
Nine.

00:21:23.21,00:21:24.69
Eight.

00:21:26.01,00:21:27.69
Okay, blast off!

00:21:36.89,00:21:38.81
I'm an alien! I'm an alien!

00:21:39.33,00:21:41.01
Oh, no! An asteroid!

00:00:03.64,00:00:06.16
Okay, pick a card.[br]Any card.

00:00:06.40,00:00:08.84
All right, now memorize it.

00:00:09.04,00:00:11.24
Show it to everybody.

00:00:11.48,00:00:12.28
Got it?

00:00:12.52,00:00:14.44
All right.[br]Give it back to me.

00:00:19.60,00:00:20.75
Five of hearts.

00:00:21.72,00:00:23.84
Real magic does exist.

00:00:24.32,00:00:25.84
Joey, how do you do it?

00:00:26.08,00:00:27.40
I can't tell you that.

00:00:30.92,00:00:33.44
Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.

00:00:34.12,00:00:36.72
That's our unbelievably loud[br]upstairs neighbor.

00:00:36.92,00:00:39.48
He took up the carpets,[br]and now you can hear everything.

00:00:39.68,00:00:43.07
Why don't you go ask him[br]to just, "Step lightly, please?"

00:00:44.08,00:00:46.96
I have, like five times.[br]But the guy is so charming. . .

00:00:47.20,00:00:50.24
. . .I go up there to yell,[br]then I end up apologizing to him.

00:00:50.44,00:00:52.32
That is silly!

00:00:53.12,00:00:55.08
I'll go up and tell him[br]to keep it down.

00:00:55.40,00:00:57.12
-All right, be my guest.[br]-Good luck.

00:00:57.32,00:00:58.28
All right, all right. . .

00:00:58.52,00:01:01.04
. . .if you wanna know how I did it,[br]I'll show you.

00:01:01.84,00:01:04.92
When you handed me back the card,[br]what you didn't see was. . .

00:01:05.12,00:01:08.48
. . .I looked at it so fast,[br]it was invisible to the naked eye.

00:01:10.36,00:01:11.64
I just did it.

00:01:12.44,00:01:13.56
Just did it again.

00:01:15.04,00:01:18.04
Here, I'll slow it down[br]so you guys can see it. Ready?

00:01:19.88,00:01:21.72
-I got it now![br]-Okay.

00:01:39.52,00:01:40.67
Thank you.

00:02:31.52,00:02:35.44
Anybody got a length of rope about[br]6 feet long, with a noose at the end?

00:02:35.64,00:02:38.64
-Honey, what's the matter?[br]-I just saw Janice.

00:02:38.88,00:02:43.80
She was at Rockefeller Center, skating[br]with her husband. She looked so happy.

00:02:44.00,00:02:47.24
I almost feel bad for whipping[br]that kid's pretzel at them.

00:02:48.80,00:02:51.68
I remember the first time I saw[br]Katherine after we broke up.

00:02:51.88,00:02:54.68
She was walking and talking[br]with her friend, Donna.

00:02:54.92,00:02:56.32
God, it killed me!

00:02:57.08,00:03:00.60
But you ended up having sex[br]with both of them that afternoon.

00:03:02.00,00:03:04.56
Sorry, I just--[br]Any excuse to tell that story.

00:03:06.80,00:03:09.84
There's a party tomorrow.[br]You'll feel better then.

00:03:10.08,00:03:13.44
I'm gonna be okay. You don't[br]have to throw a party for me.

00:03:13.64,00:03:15.44
It's Joey's birthday.

00:03:16.32,00:03:19.04
Then if anybody should have a party,[br]it should be him.

00:03:22.40,00:03:25.24
I cannot believe[br]she's still up there.

00:03:33.68,00:03:36.28
Well, he totally[br]screwed up the punch line.

00:03:36.52,00:03:38.28
You know, it's supposed to be--

00:03:45.60,00:03:47.08
How's that coffee coming, dear?

00:03:47.32,00:03:48.80
Right away, Mr. Kaplan.

00:03:49.00,00:03:51.60
I'm not suppose to drink it.[br]It makes me gassy.

00:03:53.32,00:03:54.44
I know.

00:03:56.04,00:03:59.04
I'll bet you're thinking,[br]"What's an intelligent girl. . .

00:03:59.24,00:04:01.92
. . .who wants to be in fashion[br]doing making coffee?"

00:04:03.08,00:04:04.23
You got me.

00:04:04.96,00:04:07.08
Don't think I haven't noticed[br]your potential.

00:04:07.32,00:04:11.28
I've got a project for you[br]that's a lot more related to fashion.

00:04:11.48,00:04:13.87
-How does that sound?[br]-That sounds great!

00:04:14.12,00:04:17.08
-Come on over here, sweetheart.[br]-Thank you so much.

00:04:17.32,00:04:20.92
I need these hangers separated[br]ASAP.

00:04:23.24,00:04:24.23
You're welcome.

00:04:28.68,00:04:30.99
Oh, God, I hate my job![br]I hate it.

00:04:31.20,00:04:32.68
I know, honey. I'm sorry.

00:04:32.88,00:04:36.16
I want to quit, but then I think I[br]should stick it out.

00:04:36.40,00:04:37.39
Then I think:

00:04:37.72,00:04:40.68
"Why would a person stay[br]in such a demeaning job. . .

00:04:40.92,00:04:45.24
. . .just because it's remotely related[br]to the field they're interested in?

00:04:46.80,00:04:48.36
Gee, I don't know, Rach.

00:04:48.60,00:04:52.28
Order up! Yentl soup, James Beans,[br]and a Howdy, hold the Doody.

00:04:53.12,00:04:54.96
Come on, I'm sorry.[br]I didn't--

00:04:55.20,00:04:56.68
I don't mind paying my dues.

00:04:56.88,00:04:59.00
But how much[br]will I learn about fashion. . .

00:04:59.20,00:05:01.43
. . .by walking Myra,[br]the arthritic seamstress. . .

00:05:01.64,00:05:03.64
. . .to the bathroom?

00:05:05.48,00:05:06.28
Hi.

00:05:06.52,00:05:08.40
Is my misery amusing to you?

00:05:08.88,00:05:10.84
I'm sorry, I was just. . . .

00:05:11.48,00:05:13.48
It's not funny.[br]This is actually my job.

00:05:13.68,00:05:15.08
Believe me, I've been there.

00:05:15.32,00:05:18.84
I had to sort mannequin heads[br]at that Mannequins Plus.

00:05:19.48,00:05:22.84
I'm just gonna go back[br]to talking to my friend here.

00:05:23.08,00:05:25.84
You can go back to enjoying[br]your little hamburger.

00:05:27.32,00:05:29.52
Just one other thing.

00:05:30.68,00:05:32.04
I work at Bloomingdale's.

00:05:32.28,00:05:35.44
I might know of a possible job,[br]if you're interested.

00:05:38.40,00:05:39.60
Do you want my pickle?

00:05:46.48,00:05:47.28
Hey, guys.

00:05:47.52,00:05:48.72
-Hey, Gunther.[br]-Hi.

00:05:48.92,00:05:51.39
You're going on a date[br]with the noisy guy upstairs?

00:05:51.60,00:05:53.64
Well, he's very charming.

00:05:54.08,00:05:55.04
He's too charming!

00:05:55.28,00:05:58.40
But if you go out,[br]it'll be harder for me to hate him.

00:05:58.72,00:06:00.28
You'll just have to try.

00:06:02.44,00:06:04.36
Joey? Where are the Jell-O shots?

00:06:04.60,00:06:07.64
I don't know. Chandler's[br]supposed to be passing them--

00:06:08.32,00:06:09.44
Chandler!

00:06:09.68,00:06:11.04
Hello-dee-lo!

00:06:12.08,00:06:14.04
Well, somebody's feeling better.

00:06:15.24,00:06:17.47
-Stick out your tongue![br]-Take off your shirt!

00:06:21.12,00:06:22.88
-Oh, my![br]-Oh, my God!

00:06:23.08,00:06:25.55
How many did you have?[br]They're pure vodka.

00:06:25.76,00:06:28.44
Yeah, Jell-O.[br]Just like Mom used to make.

00:06:30.16,00:06:32.63
The most unbelievable thing[br]happened today.

00:06:34.52,00:06:36.67
I had lunch at Monica's[br]and met a guy. . .

00:06:36.88,00:06:38.88
. . .who works for a buyer[br]at Bloomingdale's.

00:06:39.12,00:06:42.67
There's an opening there![br]So I gave him my phone number. . .

00:06:42.92,00:06:46.23
. . .and he'll call me this weekend[br]to get me an interview!

00:06:47.84,00:06:51.23
So this guy's helping you[br]for no apparent reason?

00:06:52.80,00:06:55.27
And he's a total stranger?

00:06:55.48,00:06:58.28
Yeah. His name is "Mark" something.

00:06:58.52,00:07:01.83
Sounds like "Mark Something"[br]wants to have some sex!

00:07:02.92,00:07:03.88
What?

00:07:04.76,00:07:08.64
Why else would he swoop[br]in out of nowhere for no reason?

00:07:09.32,00:07:10.39
To be nice?

00:07:10.64,00:07:14.35
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice[br]to strange women for no reason?

00:07:14.60,00:07:16.00
-No, only for sex.[br]-Thank you.

00:07:18.68,00:07:21.99
So did you tell[br]"Mark Something" about me?

00:07:22.80,00:07:24.84
I didn't have to.[br]I was wearing. . .

00:07:25.04,00:07:28.43
. . .my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board[br]and ringing my bell.

00:07:30.28,00:07:33.20
Joey![br]Happy birthday!

00:07:36.96,00:07:39.92
How many of that girl are you seeing?

00:07:42.24,00:07:45.08
How hammered are you?[br]These are Joey's sisters.

00:07:45.32,00:07:46.88
Hi, Joey's sisters!

00:07:48.52,00:07:49.96
What're we drinking over here?

00:07:50.28,00:07:53.24
Well, I have a vodka[br]and cranberry juice.

00:07:53.44,00:07:54.24
No kidding?

00:07:54.48,00:07:58.16
That's the same drink I made myself[br]right after I shot my husband.

00:08:01.48,00:08:03.76
Okay, I don't know how[br]to talk to you.

00:08:05.40,00:08:06.68
What are you doing?

00:08:07.24,00:08:10.63
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend[br]off my speed dialer.

00:08:11.20,00:08:13.16
No, it's a good thing.

00:08:13.40,00:08:16.68
Why must we dial so speedily anyway?[br]Why rush through life?

00:08:16.92,00:08:18.84
Why can't we savor[br]the precious moments?

00:08:19.08,00:08:20.52
You have some huge breasts!

00:08:22.96,00:08:24.64
-Hi.[br]-Hi.

00:08:25.28,00:08:29.24
So I heard about this Mark guy[br]that Rachel met today.

00:08:29.48,00:08:30.47
Isn't it great?

00:08:32.24,00:08:35.04
Yeah, pretty good.[br]He sounds like a nice, good guy.

00:08:35.24,00:08:38.16
Oh, he is.[br]And he is so dreamy!

00:08:38.40,00:08:41.04
I mean, when he left,[br]I actually used the phrase:

00:08:41.28,00:08:43.12
"Hummina, hummina, hummina. "

00:08:45.12,00:08:46.44
That's excellent.

00:08:50.28,00:08:52.64
So he's "just a nice guy. "

00:08:53.24,00:08:56.79
Do you really think this Mark[br]doesn't want anything for helping you?

00:08:57.04,00:08:59.96
Well, I assume I'll[br]have to take showers with him.

00:09:00.20,00:09:01.68
But that's true of any job.

00:09:06.72,00:09:07.63
How you feeling?

00:09:07.88,00:09:09.88
Well, my apartment isn't[br]there anymore. . .

00:09:10.12,00:09:11.84
. . .because I drank it.

00:09:14.32,00:09:17.76
Where'd you go? We lost you[br]after you opened up all the presents.

00:09:18.28,00:09:22.04
I ended up in the storage room,[br]and not alone.

00:09:24.52,00:09:26.83
No "woo-hooing. " No "woo-hooing. "

00:09:28.28,00:09:29.16
Why, what happened?

00:09:32.20,00:09:34.04
I fooled around with Joey's sister.

00:09:35.44,00:09:36.96
That's not the worst part.

00:09:37.32,00:09:38.68
What is the worst part?

00:09:38.88,00:09:40.84
I can't remember which sister.

00:09:42.08,00:09:44.47
You see what men do?[br]Don't tell me men are nice.

00:09:44.80,00:09:46.36
This is men!

00:09:50.08,00:09:51.15
Are you insane?

00:09:51.40,00:09:54.20
Joey will kill you.[br]He'll actually kill you dead.

00:09:54.40,00:09:56.40
You don't think I thought of that?

00:09:57.32,00:10:00.08
-How can you not know which one?[br]-That's unbelievable.

00:10:00.32,00:10:02.12
-Was it Gina?[br]-Which one's Gina?

00:10:02.36,00:10:04.56
The dark, big hair,[br]with airplane earrings.

00:10:04.80,00:10:05.84
That's Dina, not Gina.

00:10:06.52,00:10:09.44
See? You can't tell[br]which is which either!

00:10:11.40,00:10:13.84
We didn't fool around[br]with any of them.

00:10:17.44,00:10:20.44
It's got to be veronica.[br]The girl in the red skirt.

00:10:20.68,00:10:23.44
I definitely stuck my tongue[br]down her throat!

00:10:24.04,00:10:24.84
That was me.

00:10:28.52,00:10:31.36
When I drink, sometimes[br]I get overly friendly. . .

00:10:31.60,00:10:33.24
-. . .and I'm sorry.[br]-That's okay.

00:10:33.44,00:10:35.24
-That's all right.[br]-That's okay.

00:10:39.40,00:10:41.24
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:10:42.72,00:10:44.04
Hey, Joey!

00:10:46.52,00:10:47.43
Come on.

00:10:48.52,00:10:50.04
Why can't we talk in here. . .

00:10:50.24,00:10:51.64
. . .with witnesses?

00:10:52.72,00:10:54.64
I just got off the phone[br]with my sister.

00:10:54.84,00:10:55.64
Which one?

00:10:55.88,00:10:58.11
-Mary Angela.[br]-Mary Angela.

00:10:58.52,00:11:00.40
Now which one is she again?

00:11:00.60,00:11:02.96
Ask Chandler.[br]He fooled around with her.

00:11:03.52,00:11:06.48
She told me you said[br]you could really fall for her.

00:11:06.72,00:11:10.60
Is that true, or are you just getting[br]over Janice by groping my sister?

00:11:13.52,00:11:15.24
It's gotta be the first one.

00:11:16.44,00:11:17.27
Really?

00:11:17.80,00:11:19.32
That's great!

00:11:20.32,00:11:22.84
You and my sister, sitting in a tree!

00:11:24.40,00:11:25.84
Yep, I'm in a tree.

00:11:29.16,00:11:30.76
Did he call? Did Mark call?

00:11:31.00,00:11:33.20
I'm sorry.[br]But the weekend's not over yet.

00:11:36.60,00:11:39.16
Oh, my God! ls that Phoebe?

00:11:39.40,00:11:41.60
Guess they're back from their date.

00:11:43.32,00:11:45.04
Music!

00:11:45.68,00:11:47.64
very nice!

00:11:55.28,00:11:56.32
Oh, my God!

00:11:59.32,00:12:00.60
So how are you?

00:12:01.40,00:12:04.76
-I am good. I finished my book.[br]-What's it about?

00:12:04.96,00:12:07.64
I don't remember.[br]Do you want to take a walk?

00:12:11.28,00:12:12.40
"Dear Mary Angela:

00:12:13.04,00:12:14.56
Hi, how's it going?

00:12:14.76,00:12:17.07
This is the hardest letter[br]I've ever had to write. "

00:12:17.32,00:12:19.36
What the hell's the matter with you?

00:12:19.88,00:12:23.24
How will Joey react to you[br]blowing off his sister with a letter?

00:12:23.44,00:12:26.08
That's where you tell him[br]that I moved to France. . .

00:12:27.12,00:12:28.96
. . .when actually I'll be in Cuba.

00:12:29.68,00:12:32.92
Look, you've got to do this[br]yourself in person.

00:12:33.12,00:12:34.16
You know her name.

00:12:34.40,00:12:36.96
You just go to the house[br]and ask for Mary Angela.

00:12:37.20,00:12:39.43
When whichever one she is[br]comes to the door. . .

00:12:39.64,00:12:42.03
. . .take her for a walk[br]and let her down easy.

00:12:42.68,00:12:45.36
What if she comes to the door[br]and I ask for her?

00:12:46.84,00:12:47.64
Where in Cuba?

00:13:00.96,00:13:02.72
What are you doing here?

00:13:02.92,00:13:04.88
Waiting for my grandma[br]to do my laundry.

00:13:05.12,00:13:06.16
What about you?

00:13:07.00,00:13:09.12
I'm here to see Mary Angela.

00:13:09.88,00:13:12.11
You are so the man! Come on.

00:13:13.68,00:13:15.56
Now look, listen.[br]Listen. . . .

00:13:16.24,00:13:18.84
Be cool, because Grandma[br]doesn't know about you two.

00:13:19.08,00:13:20.64
You don't want to tick her off.

00:13:21.12,00:13:25.04
She was, like, the sixth person[br]to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.

00:13:26.60,00:13:27.75
Where's Mary Angela?

00:13:28.92,00:13:30.64
She's right in there.

00:13:32.84,00:13:34.64
-Hey, Chandler![br]-Hey, Chandler!

00:13:38.72,00:13:40.56
I can't believe Mark didn't call.

00:13:40.80,00:13:42.48
It's Sunday night and he didn't call.

00:13:42.88,00:13:43.87
Bummer.

00:13:45.08,00:13:48.12
Yeah, right. Look at you.[br]You're practically giddy.

00:13:48.32,00:13:50.68
I'm genuinely sorry[br]the Mark thing didn't work out.

00:13:50.92,00:13:54.96
Look, Rach, I want[br]only good things for you.

00:13:55.20,00:13:57.35
Wait a minute.[br]Why don't you just call Mark?

00:13:59.92,00:14:02.07
Who says you have to sit[br]and wait for him?

00:14:02.28,00:14:03.92
You've got to make stuff happen!

00:14:04.12,00:14:06.92
Yeah, but you don't[br]wanna seem too pushy.

00:14:07.72,00:14:10.24
It's not pushy.[br]He gave her his home number.

00:14:10.60,00:14:13.56
He gave you his home number,[br]as in, to his home?

00:14:13.80,00:14:17.48
And you don't mind if I call,[br]because you want good things for me.

00:14:17.72,00:14:21.24
That's right, good things.[br]That is what I said.

00:14:24.44,00:14:27.44
Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Greene.

00:14:30.72,00:14:33.64
Oh, no.[br]Don't you apologize.

00:14:34.32,00:14:35.28
Yeah, I'll hold.

00:14:35.80,00:14:37.28
He left my number at work.

00:14:37.52,00:14:40.56
Then he had to help his niece[br]with her report on the pioneers.

00:14:41.44,00:14:43.64
That is so made up!

00:14:44.88,00:14:46.44
Oh, my God! Tomorrow?

00:14:46.68,00:14:48.28
That's--[br]No, it's perfect.

00:14:48.52,00:14:50.64
Oh, God![br]Thank you so much!

00:14:50.84,00:14:52.28
Great.

00:14:52.68,00:14:53.80
I got the interview!

00:14:54.84,00:14:55.64
There you go!

00:14:55.84,00:14:58.76
He even offered to meet me for lunch[br]and prep me for it.

00:14:59.00,00:14:59.96
That is amazing!

00:15:00.72,00:15:03.84
Well, if I know Mark,[br]and I think I do. . .

00:15:04.84,00:15:06.24
. . .I'd expect nothing less.

00:15:06.48,00:15:07.92
I gotta figure out what to wear.

00:15:08.12,00:15:11.24
High collar and baggy pants say,[br]"I'm a pro! "

00:15:12.08,00:15:13.07
Yeah, right.

00:15:13.32,00:15:15.24
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

00:15:15.68,00:15:17.24
You go get them!

00:15:17.92,00:15:20.84
What did I do to you?[br]Did I hurt you in some way?

00:15:21.48,00:15:22.28
What?

00:15:22.48,00:15:24.63
"Why don't you call him?"

00:15:25.04,00:15:28.35
Thank you very much.[br]Now he's gonna prep her. . .

00:15:28.56,00:15:32.40
. . .as in what you do before[br]you surgically remove the boyfriend!

00:15:32.84,00:15:33.75
Are you crazy?

00:15:33.96,00:15:37.24
Am l? Am I out of my mind?[br]Am I losing my senses?

00:15:39.00,00:15:42.28
This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend[br]out for a meal!

00:15:42.52,00:15:44.20
This isn't even about you!

00:15:44.40,00:15:46.92
It's about something wonderful[br]happening for Rachel.

00:15:47.36,00:15:50.04
Even if you're right,[br]and he wants to sleep with her. . .

00:15:50.24,00:15:51.84
. . .does that mean he gets to?

00:15:52.24,00:15:54.08
-No, but--[br]-Don't you trust her?

00:15:55.60,00:15:58.04
Then get over yourself![br]Grow up!

00:16:02.08,00:16:03.64
You grow up.

00:16:14.80,00:16:17.32
This tiramisu is excellent.

00:16:18.12,00:16:19.76
Did you make it, Mary Angela?

00:16:19.96,00:16:21.24
No, I did.

00:16:22.44,00:16:24.04
Well, it's yummy.

00:16:25.12,00:16:25.92
So. . . .

00:16:26.28,00:16:28.64
Mary Angela, do you like it?

00:16:28.88,00:16:31.03
Of course.[br]It's her favorite.

00:16:33.20,00:16:34.43
So. . . .

00:16:35.12,00:16:37.76
Mary Angela, what's[br]your second favorite?

00:16:37.96,00:16:39.44
More of Grandma's tiramisu.

00:16:39.68,00:16:41.83
Oh, would you just please. . .

00:16:43.72,00:16:47.43
. . .give me your recipe, because[br]this is great! It's topnotch!

00:16:47.72,00:16:48.79
That dies with me.

00:16:49.00,00:16:50.23
So will l.

00:16:52.32,00:16:54.47
Excuse yourself[br]and go to the bathroom.

00:16:54.72,00:16:57.00
I was just squinting.[br]It doesn't mean anything.

00:16:57.20,00:16:58.43
Just do it!

00:17:04.04,00:17:06.04
Will you excuse me, I have to. . . .

00:17:19.04,00:17:21.04
Finally! I thought we'd[br]never be alone.

00:17:21.28,00:17:22.84
Can I just tell you something?

00:17:23.08,00:17:25.92
I have not stopped thinking about you[br]since the party.

00:17:27.48,00:17:31.08
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.

00:17:33.00,00:17:34.68
I just got out of a relationship.

00:17:34.92,00:17:36.72
And I'm not really in a. . .

00:17:37.08,00:17:38.68
. . .in a commitment kind of place.

00:17:38.88,00:17:39.84
So? Me neither!

00:17:40.08,00:17:43.28
God, Mary Angela was right.[br]You do have the softest lips.

00:17:45.08,00:17:46.52
You're not Mary Angela?

00:17:46.88,00:17:48.68
No! I'm Mary Therese!

00:17:49.28,00:17:50.84
This is so bad.

00:17:51.28,00:17:53.96
If you're not Mary Angela,[br]then who is?

00:17:54.16,00:17:55.23
I am.

00:17:56.80,00:17:58.44
Oh, it's so bad.

00:18:00.24,00:18:02.31
No, Joey! No, Joey!

00:18:03.32,00:18:04.44
What's going on?

00:18:05.84,00:18:07.88
You're it![br]Now run and hide!

00:18:09.12,00:18:11.64
It's no big deal.[br]Chandler was just kissing me. . .

00:18:11.84,00:18:13.68
. . .because he thought[br]I was Mary Angela.

00:18:13.92,00:18:16.76
What? How could you[br]think she was Mary Angela?

00:18:16.96,00:18:19.88
I wasn't sure which one[br]Mary Angela was.

00:18:21.28,00:18:23.28
Look, I'm sorry.[br]I was really drunk. . .

00:18:23.52,00:18:25.75
. . .and you guys[br]all look really similar.

00:18:25.96,00:18:28.60
-I say punch him, Joey![br]-Yeah, punch him!

00:18:28.84,00:18:30.07
We should all calm down. . .

00:18:30.32,00:18:32.63
. . .because your brother's[br]not gonna punch me.

00:18:33.52,00:18:34.64
Are you?

00:18:35.52,00:18:37.08
That's usually what I'd do.

00:18:37.32,00:18:39.63
But I never thought you'd be[br]on the receiving end.

00:18:39.88,00:18:41.40
How could you do this?

00:18:41.60,00:18:43.83
If you wanna punch me, go ahead.[br]I deserve it.

00:18:44.08,00:18:48.24
But I want you to know that I'd never[br]soberly hurt you or your family.

00:18:48.44,00:18:50.16
You're my best friend.

00:18:50.40,00:18:53.04
And I'd never do anything[br]like this, ever again.

00:18:54.92,00:18:55.88
So what?

00:18:56.12,00:18:58.88
-I say punch him![br]-Yeah, punch him!

00:18:59.96,00:19:02.56
No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.

00:19:03.12,00:19:04.92
-I'll do it.[br]-No, you won't!

00:19:05.44,00:19:09.04
He knows he did a terrible thing,[br]and I believe him. He's sorry.

00:19:09.28,00:19:11.24
But you got one more apology to make.

00:19:11.44,00:19:13.48
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.

00:19:14.24,00:19:15.84
-Absolutely. You got it.[br]-All right.

00:19:25.76,00:19:27.60
-Cookie, now you can punch him![br]-What?

00:19:36.24,00:19:37.64
What are you doing here?

00:19:37.88,00:19:40.76
You know, this building's[br]on my paper route, so. . . .

00:19:42.72,00:19:43.95
How did it go?

00:19:44.20,00:19:46.67
The woman I interviewed with[br]was pretty tough. . .

00:19:46.92,00:19:48.72
. . .but thank God Mark coached me.

00:19:48.92,00:19:51.56
Once I talked about the Fall line,[br]she got all happy.

00:19:51.76,00:19:54.04
-I'm so proud of you.[br]-Me too!

00:19:55.24,00:19:56.47
Listen, I'm. . . .

00:19:57.60,00:20:00.84
I'm sorry I've been[br]so crazy and jealous and. . . .

00:20:01.92,00:20:04.07
It's just,[br]I like you a lot, so. . . .

00:20:04.32,00:20:05.23
I know.

00:20:07.72,00:20:08.52
-Hi.[br]-Hi, Mark.

00:20:09.04,00:20:12.32
I just talked to Joanna,[br]and she loves you. You got the job.

00:20:13.12,00:20:14.27
I did?

00:20:15.12,00:20:16.32
Oh, my God!

00:20:16.56,00:20:18.92
Congratulations. . . .

00:20:23.84,00:20:25.07
So, Phoebe?

00:20:25.48,00:20:26.39
How was your date?

00:20:26.60,00:20:28.12
Oh, well, you know. . . .

00:20:28.72,00:20:30.64
Yeah, I do know.

00:20:31.28,00:20:32.51
You were eavesdropping?

00:20:32.72,00:20:36.51
Eavesdropping? Pheebs, the ceiling[br]tiles were falling down.

00:20:38.16,00:20:39.64
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:20:39.84,00:20:44.76
But I really like this guy[br]and I think he really likes me.

00:20:49.92,00:20:50.96
Maybe he's just. . .

00:20:51.20,00:20:54.28
. . .jumping on a pogo stick[br]and he really likes it.

00:20:57.84,00:20:59.80
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.

00:21:01.60,00:21:04.24
All right, that's it.[br]He cannot do this to Phoebe!

00:21:04.44,00:21:07.48
This guy's gonna get[br]the butt-kicking of a lifetime!

00:21:07.72,00:21:09.84
But is he a big guy?

00:21:10.12,00:21:11.27
We'll all go. Come on.

00:21:11.48,00:21:13.04
Thanks, you guys.[br]Thank you!

00:21:13.24,00:21:14.04
Don't worry!

00:21:14.64,00:21:17.60
God![br]I hope they kick his ass!

00:21:17.80,00:21:19.16
Honey, I'm sorry.

00:21:19.36,00:21:20.92
If it's any consolation. . .

00:21:21.12,00:21:23.84
. . .he sounded like[br]he had more fun with you.

00:00:07.24,00:00:08.20
Six dollars, please.

00:00:08.44,00:00:10.83
Six? I just had it for one night.[br]It's three.

00:00:11.08,00:00:14.52
Eight o'clock's the cutoff.[br]And, oh, it's 8:02.

00:00:16.12,00:00:18.72
You know, in a weird way,[br]you have too much power.

00:00:19.68,00:00:22.20
You have to help me[br]because I only have three.

00:00:22.92,00:00:24.80
I can help with that.

00:00:25.80,00:00:28.84
Oh, my God. Richard?

00:00:32.20,00:00:33.84
Your lip went bald.

00:00:36.00,00:00:37.07
Thanks.

00:00:39.28,00:00:40.68
You look great!

00:00:41.20,00:00:42.00
Right.

00:00:42.20,00:00:43.84
No, you do. You. . . .

00:00:45.80,00:00:46.60
What?

00:00:46.80,00:00:48.87
You got panties stuck to your leg.

00:00:53.00,00:00:56.88
I was just grabbing some things[br]out of the dryer, and static cling.

00:00:57.92,00:01:02.12
Or maybe God knew I'd be running into[br]you and saw an opportunity.

00:01:03.08,00:01:04.20
It's good to see you.

00:01:04.40,00:01:06.24
It's good to see you too.

00:01:10.88,00:01:12.84

00:01:56.80,00:01:58.84
See that guy?[br]He's in "Classics" now. . .

00:01:59.08,00:02:02.36
. . .but as soon as we leave,[br]he's going straight to the porn.

00:02:02.60,00:02:07.12
He'll go to the counter with Citizen[br]Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.

00:02:11.36,00:02:12.59
This is nice.

00:02:13.44,00:02:15.28
-I miss this.[br]-Me too.

00:02:16.08,00:02:18.08
You want to get a hamburger[br]or something?

00:02:18.32,00:02:20.28
I don't know if that's a good idea.

00:02:20.48,00:02:22.95
Just friends.[br]I won't grope you. I promise.

00:02:23.92,00:02:25.68
I think it's too soon.

00:02:25.88,00:02:28.32
No, it's not too soon.[br]I had lunch at 1 1 .

00:02:32.20,00:02:33.40
Yeah, baby!

00:02:34.56,00:02:37.08
-What are you making?[br]-Chocolate milk. Want some?

00:02:37.32,00:02:38.72
No, thanks. I'm 29.

00:02:40.28,00:02:41.96
Oh, my God! I gotta go to work!

00:02:42.20,00:02:44.48
What time will you get off tonight?

00:02:44.72,00:02:45.95
It could be really late.

00:02:46.20,00:02:47.43
Not again!

00:02:48.00,00:02:50.96
I know. I'm sorry.[br]I'll make a deal with you, okay?

00:02:51.20,00:02:53.96
Every night that you're asleep[br]before I get home. . .

00:02:54.20,00:02:58.08
. . .I will wake you up in a way[br]that has proved popular in the past.

00:02:58.28,00:03:01.91
Well, if you need to stay late,[br]I want to be supportive of that.

00:03:05.64,00:03:07.95
Look at you.[br]Since when do you rollerblade?

00:03:08.20,00:03:09.96
Since tomorrow.

00:03:10.76,00:03:12.24
I met a cute guy in the park.

00:03:12.48,00:03:15.64
And he jogs and blades and swims[br]and so we made a deal.

00:03:15.88,00:03:18.24
He's gonna teach me how[br]to do jock stuff.

00:03:20.04,00:03:22.72
-And what are you gonna do for him?[br]-I'm gonna let him.

00:03:22.96,00:03:23.87
Cool.

00:03:24.32,00:03:25.44
Good morning.

00:03:26.20,00:03:28.32
Somebody got in late last night.

00:03:28.52,00:03:31.32
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

00:03:31.88,00:03:33.00
When did this happen?

00:03:33.84,00:03:35.72
Around 8:02.

00:03:36.60,00:03:40.68
We talked for a while, and then[br]we went out for an innocent burger.

00:03:40.92,00:03:43.31
There's no such thing as[br]an "innocent burger. "

00:03:44.12,00:03:46.16
-Gonna see him again?[br]-Tomorrow night.

00:03:46.36,00:03:48.08
Monica, what are you doing?

00:03:48.32,00:03:50.55
She spent six months[br]getting over him. . .

00:03:50.76,00:03:55.12
. . .and now she's celebrating that[br]by going on a date with him.

00:03:56.08,00:03:58.00
It's not a date, okay?

00:03:58.24,00:04:01.68
I'm teaching him how to make a[br]lasagna for a potluck dinner.

00:04:01.92,00:04:05.80
You might want to make extra, because[br]you'll be hungry after the sex.

00:04:07.92,00:04:09.72
We're not gonna have sex.

00:04:09.96,00:04:14.04
Nothing's changed here. He still[br]doesn't want children, and I still do.

00:04:14.28,00:04:16.12
So we're just gonna be friends.

00:04:16.36,00:04:17.96
Naked friends.

00:04:23.60,00:04:25.88
-Do you have any ice?[br]-Check the freezer.

00:04:26.12,00:04:28.51
If there's none in there,[br]we're probably out.

00:04:28.88,00:04:30.76
Are you just getting home?[br]It's late.

00:04:31.00,00:04:33.15
I know.[br]I had the greatest day, though.

00:04:33.40,00:04:35.87
I went to a meeting[br]with reps from Calvin Klein.

00:04:36.12,00:04:40.60
I liked a line of lingerie, so my boss[br]ordered a ton of it. And you?

00:04:41.08,00:04:45.12
I discovered I'm able to count all my[br]teeth using just my tongue.

00:04:49.40,00:04:52.95
Why do you have a copy of[br]The Shining in your freezer?

00:04:53.28,00:04:56.20
I was reading it last night[br]and I got scared, so. . . .

00:04:58.16,00:05:00.68
But you're safe from it[br]if it's in the freezer?

00:05:00.92,00:05:02.76
Well, safer.

00:05:02.96,00:05:04.76
I never start reading it. . .

00:05:04.96,00:05:07.84
. . .without making sure[br]we got room in the freezer.

00:05:09.00,00:05:10.80
How often do you read it?

00:05:11.00,00:05:13.72
Haven't you ever read a book[br]over and over again?

00:05:14.68,00:05:16.36
I read Little Women more than once.

00:05:16.60,00:05:18.67
It's a classic.[br]What's so great about The Shining?

00:05:18.88,00:05:22.40
The question should be, what is[br]not so great about The Shining?

00:05:24.16,00:05:27.16
And the answer would be,[br]"nothing. " All right?

00:05:27.40,00:05:29.20
This is the scariest book ever.

00:05:29.40,00:05:31.96
I bet it's better than that[br]classic of yours.

00:05:34.32,00:05:36.24
We'll just see about that, okay?

00:05:36.48,00:05:41.35
I will read The Shining,[br]and you will read Little Women.

00:05:42.12,00:05:43.92
All right, you got it.

00:05:44.36,00:05:47.44
Now, Rach, these little women. . . .

00:05:49.00,00:05:50.60
How little are they?

00:05:50.84,00:05:53.60
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

00:05:59.56,00:06:02.32
Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.

00:06:03.40,00:06:05.68
You have lipstick right here.

00:06:06.00,00:06:08.52
That's okay, it's mine.[br]We just kissed.

00:06:09.12,00:06:11.72
Isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

00:06:11.96,00:06:14.32
Well, I'm from California.

00:06:14.60,00:06:17.84
Right. Sometimes you guys[br]just burst into flame.

00:06:28.00,00:06:32.92
I'm up. I'm up. I've gotten up now.[br]Anybody want anything?

00:06:33.40,00:06:34.76
-I'll have coffee.[br]-Me too.

00:06:35.00,00:06:35.88
Make that three.

00:06:36.12,00:06:38.51
Ross, why don't you come with me?

00:06:43.36,00:06:45.36
What's the matter?[br]What's going on?

00:06:45.60,00:06:47.44
Robert's coming out.

00:06:48.08,00:06:49.76
What do you mean?[br]ls he gay?

00:06:55.68,00:06:57.75
He's coming out of his shorts.

00:07:00.32,00:07:01.72
What?

00:07:02.28,00:07:04.51
The man is showing brain.

00:07:08.60,00:07:10.99
Are you sure? Hold on.

00:07:12.84,00:07:14.84
I'm sorry.[br]That was a coffee and a. . . .

00:07:15.08,00:07:16.56
Coffee. We could write it down.

00:07:16.80,00:07:19.84
No, no. That won't be necessary.

00:07:26.00,00:07:26.80
Well?

00:07:29.36,00:07:30.64
What do we do? What do we do?

00:07:30.88,00:07:35.80
Well, I suppose we just[br]try to not look directly at it.

00:07:37.48,00:07:39.52
Like an eclipse.

00:07:43.36,00:07:46.04
When people compliment my[br]cooking tonight, what do I say?

00:07:46.28,00:07:50.04
You say, "Thank you. "[br]Then you buy me something pretty.

00:07:50.28,00:07:52.75
Come on, we're gonna[br]put our hands in this bowl. . .

00:07:53.00,00:07:55.72
. . .and we're gonna start[br]squishing the tomatoes.

00:07:56.60,00:07:59.72
This feels very weird.

00:08:00.48,00:08:02.68
You touch people's eyeballs[br]and this feels weird?

00:08:02.92,00:08:07.60
Sure, I touch them. But I spent years[br]learning not to squish them.

00:08:13.20,00:08:14.92
That's my hand.

00:08:18.08,00:08:20.92
-Keep squishing.[br]-The tomatoes are squishing.

00:08:23.48,00:08:25.76
You got some on your shirt.

00:08:26.00,00:08:27.12
Hold on a second.

00:08:27.96,00:08:31.88
Just put a little club soda on it.[br]Get to it right away.

00:08:32.12,00:08:33.92
It should do. . .

00:08:35.56,00:08:36.79
. . .the trick.

00:08:45.64,00:08:46.44
What?

00:08:47.96,00:08:49.36
You've got some on your pants.

00:08:52.80,00:08:54.72
I'll just throw them out.

00:09:00.40,00:09:02.32
These little women!

00:09:05.56,00:09:06.55
You're liking it?

00:09:06.80,00:09:10.04
Oh, yeah.[br]Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

00:09:10.28,00:09:12.40
I don't see how he could forgive her.

00:09:15.36,00:09:18.36
Jo's a girl.[br]It's short for Josephine.

00:09:19.00,00:09:21.52
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

00:09:26.68,00:09:28.75
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

00:09:29.00,00:09:31.68
That is the one thing missing[br]from The Shining.

00:09:34.52,00:09:36.56
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

00:09:37.80,00:09:40.88
No wonder Rachel had to read this so[br]many times.

00:09:44.56,00:09:46.63
How'd the basketball go?

00:09:46.88,00:09:51.32
I learned how to shoot a lay-up,[br]a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

00:09:51.60,00:09:52.92
You mean a 3-pointer?

00:09:53.16,00:09:55.52
I get more because I'm dainty.

00:09:56.92,00:09:59.44
Is there a phone here[br]to check my messages?

00:09:59.68,00:10:03.60
-In back. Do you want a quarter?[br]-I always carry one in my sock.

00:10:15.48,00:10:18.04
What are you doing?[br]Get back on your side--

00:10:18.28,00:10:19.56
Hello!

00:10:24.52,00:10:26.12
I'm Joey. We haven't met.

00:10:26.36,00:10:27.72
Good to meet you. Robert.

00:10:31.68,00:10:32.80
What?

00:10:33.64,00:10:36.80
What? You guys, what is going on?

00:10:37.04,00:10:38.72
Do you not like Robert?

00:10:39.76,00:10:41.08
Why are you laughing?

00:10:41.32,00:10:43.20
Calm down.[br]No reason to get testy.

00:10:48.60,00:10:51.16
-You guys! Come on![br]-We're sorry.

00:10:51.68,00:10:56.60
It just seems that Robert isn't as[br]concealed in the shorts area. . .

00:10:57.12,00:10:58.48
. . .as one may have hoped.

00:10:59.72,00:11:01.32
What do you mean?

00:11:04.84,00:11:08.60
Could you pass me those cookies?

00:11:08.80,00:11:09.60
Sure.

00:11:15.52,00:11:17.48
So how'd the lasagna go over?

00:11:18.08,00:11:21.92
Really? Good. So you owe me three[br]pretty things.

00:11:23.80,00:11:25.72
I've been thinking about you too.

00:11:26.56,00:11:30.11
Well, no. It's hard,[br]this "platonomy" thing.

00:11:31.12,00:11:32.96
It's a word.

00:11:36.20,00:11:39.96
I do think it's better this way.[br]We're being smart.

00:11:40.20,00:11:42.12
Yes, I'm sure.

00:11:44.20,00:11:46.12
You really sure?

00:11:47.48,00:11:49.24
I'll call you back.

00:11:59.16,00:12:01.72
So we can be friends[br]who sleep together.

00:12:02.24,00:12:05.12
Absolutely.[br]This'll just be something we do.

00:12:05.32,00:12:07.92
Like racquetball.

00:12:08.88,00:12:11.11
Sounds smart and healthy to me.

00:12:12.32,00:12:16.24
So just out of curiosity. . .

00:12:16.48,00:12:19.92
. . .do you currently have[br]any other "racquetball" buddies?

00:12:20.88,00:12:22.95
Just your dad.

00:12:24.56,00:12:27.03
Although that's actually racquetball.

00:12:27.28,00:12:30.56
You know, I do have a blind date. . .

00:12:30.80,00:12:33.88
. . .with my sister's neighbor[br]next Tuesday.

00:12:36.52,00:12:38.32
Do you want me to cancel it?

00:12:38.92,00:12:40.24
No!

00:12:43.28,00:12:46.91
Because if you did,[br]that means you'd be canceling for me.

00:12:47.88,00:12:50.40
-And we're just friends.[br]-Exactly.

00:12:54.48,00:12:56.16
Oh, don't sit down.

00:12:56.40,00:12:58.00
-Ready to go?[br]-You bet.

00:12:58.24,00:13:00.31
And first, here's a gift.

00:13:04.64,00:13:06.71
Stretchy pants?!

00:13:07.08,00:13:11.48
The greatest things in the world![br]lf I were you, I'd wear them every day.

00:13:13.24,00:13:15.44
Gee, thank you.[br]Really, that's so nice.

00:13:15.68,00:13:19.92
But, to be honest,[br]I don't think I can wear these.

00:13:20.16,00:13:23.28
They're so tight.[br]I'd feel like I'm on display.

00:13:25.16,00:13:26.36
I'm sorry.

00:13:26.60,00:13:28.72
That's all right. I'll figure. . . .

00:13:33.56,00:13:34.39
How's it going?

00:13:34.64,00:13:35.92
Good.

00:13:36.48,00:13:37.80
How's The Shining?

00:13:38.00,00:13:40.36
Danny just went into Room 21 7.

00:13:40.56,00:13:44.08
The next part's the best![br]That dead lady in the bathtub--

00:13:45.36,00:13:46.64
You're gonna ruin it!

00:13:46.84,00:13:48.84
I'll talk in code.

00:13:49.08,00:13:52.44
Remember when the kid sees[br]those two "blanks" in the hallway?

00:13:53.32,00:13:54.88
Yeah, that's very cool.

00:13:55.60,00:13:59.44
All "blank" and no "blank" makes[br]"blank" a "blank-blank. "

00:14:01.48,00:14:02.92
No, the end!

00:14:03.12,00:14:05.48
Jack almost kills them[br]with the "blank" . . .

00:14:05.68,00:14:08.12
. . .but in the last second,[br]they get away.

00:14:09.00,00:14:11.00
I can't believe you just did that.

00:14:11.24,00:14:13.92
I can't believe she cracked your code.

00:14:18.56,00:14:21.95
Okay. Laurie proposes to Jo[br]and she says no. . .

00:14:22.20,00:14:26.40
. . .even though she's in love with him.[br]Then he ends up marrying Amy.

00:14:29.24,00:14:31.60
Mine was by accident!

00:14:33.00,00:14:36.44
The boiler explodes and destroys the[br]hotel and kills the dad.

00:14:38.52,00:14:39.51
Beth dies.

00:14:48.08,00:14:50.55
Beth dies?

00:14:51.88,00:14:55.56
Is that true?[br]lf I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

00:14:55.92,00:14:58.96
No, Beth doesn't die.[br]She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

00:14:59.76,00:15:01.32
He's asking if you've ruined. . .

00:15:01.52,00:15:04.80
. . .the first book he's ever loved[br]that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

00:15:08.48,00:15:11.32
No. She doesn't die.

00:15:11.56,00:15:13.32
Then why would you say that?

00:15:17.20,00:15:20.72
Because I wanted to hurt you.

00:15:22.56,00:15:25.12
Oh, there they are.[br]I dropped my keys.

00:15:27.80,00:15:29.08
Got them.

00:15:35.84,00:15:37.96
Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:15:38.20,00:15:40.24
You would not believe my day.

00:15:40.60,00:15:44.04
I had to work two shifts.[br]And then to top it off. . .

00:15:44.28,00:15:48.24
. . .I lost one of my fake boobs[br]in a grill fire.

00:15:51.52,00:15:52.96
What are you smiling at?

00:15:53.20,00:15:55.32
I was thinking your day[br]could still pick up.

00:16:03.40,00:16:05.24
I love this "friend" thing!

00:16:11.96,00:16:16.00
Robert's gonna be here any second,[br]so could one of you just tell him?

00:16:16.56,00:16:17.63
Please, right now.

00:16:17.88,00:16:21.64
Every time I see him, it's "Is it[br]on the loose? ls it watching me?"

00:16:23.36,00:16:24.35
We can't tell him.

00:16:24.60,00:16:29.52
You can't go up to a guy you barely[br]know and talk about his "stuff. "

00:16:29.96,00:16:33.72
He's right. Even if it's[br]to say something complimentary.

00:16:38.64,00:16:39.87
You ready for the gym?

00:16:40.08,00:16:42.96
There's a new rock-climbing[br]wall. We can spot each other.

00:16:44.80,00:16:47.11
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

00:16:50.24,00:16:51.15
What?

00:16:53.00,00:16:54.84
Listen, Robert. . . .

00:16:55.28,00:16:56.40
Hey, don't we have to. . .?

00:16:56.64,00:16:58.12
Yeah, we got. . . .

00:17:05.20,00:17:07.72
I think you're really, really great.

00:17:08.28,00:17:10.12
Oh, God. Here we go again.

00:17:10.36,00:17:14.68
Why does this keep happening?[br]ls it something I'm putting out there?

00:17:16.88,00:17:20.32
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

00:17:23.36,00:17:25.75
I don't know what to say.

00:17:26.80,00:17:31.56
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.[br]Put the mouse back in the house.

00:17:53.88,00:17:57.51
Really? It's just like[br]everyone else's apartment.

00:17:57.72,00:17:59.84
It's got rooms and walls[br]and ceilings.

00:18:00.08,00:18:03.16
I just wanted to see where you live.[br]Now give me the tour.

00:18:03.36,00:18:05.00
Oh, my God!

00:18:05.24,00:18:07.60
-This is the living room.[br]-That's nice.

00:18:08.76,00:18:11.12
-And this is the kitchen.[br]-That's real pretty.

00:18:11.36,00:18:13.43
Wait a minute.[br]Don't I get to see the bedroom?

00:18:14.40,00:18:17.20
Well, it's pretty much your typical. . .

00:18:18.40,00:18:19.80
. . .bedroom.

00:18:20.80,00:18:24.43
We're still on this side of the door.[br]I didn't get to see it.

00:18:24.68,00:18:29.16
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.[br]Thanks for a lovely evening.

00:18:46.28,00:18:48.00
So who is she?

00:18:48.32,00:18:51.24
That was the blind date[br]I told you about.

00:18:51.44,00:18:54.40
She called[br]and switched it from Tuesday.

00:18:56.12,00:18:57.92
Did you like her?

00:18:58.12,00:19:02.72
I'm just asking as a friend,[br]because I am totally fine with this.

00:19:05.12,00:19:06.84
Well, you seem fine.

00:19:07.56,00:19:10.52
Okay, you know what?[br]I'm not fine. I'm not.

00:19:10.76,00:19:14.31
I mean, how could I be fine?[br]Hearing you come in with her.

00:19:14.52,00:19:16.91
She wants to see your bedroom.

00:19:24.00,00:19:25.44
You know what?

00:19:27.68,00:19:29.72
What if we're friends. . .

00:19:30.52,00:19:32.36
. . .who don't see other people?

00:19:34.76,00:19:36.12
You mean "exclusive" friends?

00:19:36.96,00:19:38.28
Why not?

00:19:39.16,00:19:42.52
I mean, this has been[br]the most amazing week.

00:19:43.92,00:19:45.60
Would it be so terrible?

00:19:46.48,00:19:50.32
Even if we were friends[br]who lived together?

00:19:52.60,00:19:56.92
Or maybe someday, friends who stood[br]up in front of their other friends. . .

00:19:57.12,00:19:59.76
. . .and vowed to be friends forever.

00:20:06.28,00:20:08.48
You know, we're back where we were.

00:20:10.12,00:20:15.04
Honey, I would love to do all that,[br]but nothing's changed.

00:20:15.40,00:20:18.84
That's not true.[br]You don't have a moustache.

00:20:21.00,00:20:23.39
Okay, one thing's changed.

00:20:23.80,00:20:27.11
But we still want different things,[br]and we know how this is gonna end.

00:20:28.32,00:20:29.72
You know what?

00:20:30.20,00:20:32.92
I gotta walk out of here right now.

00:20:34.20,00:20:37.91
Because getting over you is the[br]hardest thing I have ever had to do.

00:20:39.80,00:20:41.68
I don't think I could do it again.

00:20:42.68,00:20:44.16
I know I couldn't.

00:20:59.40,00:21:01.71
How about one last[br]game of racquetball?

00:21:07.52,00:21:09.52
Watch the thorns!

00:21:16.40,00:21:17.20
What?

00:21:19.48,00:21:21.20
Beth is really, really sick.

00:21:26.40,00:21:30.32
Jo's there, but I don't think[br]there's anything she can do.

00:21:35.24,00:21:37.60
You wanna put the book[br]in the freezer?

00:00:11.19,00:00:14.81
'Cause every time I see your face

00:00:15.39,00:00:18.82
I can 't help but fall from grace

00:00:19.07,00:00:20.50
This girl's good.

00:00:20.71,00:00:24.33
Yeah, a song with rhyming words![br]I never thought of that before.

00:00:26.71,00:00:27.54
I like her.

00:00:27.75,00:00:31.82
Why? Because she can both sing[br]and play guitar at the same time?

00:00:32.83,00:00:35.46
That's all I'm looking for[br]from these people.

00:00:36.31,00:00:38.14
Look at you, all jealous.

00:00:38.39,00:00:41.46
Come on, Pheebs. You two have[br]completely different styles.

00:00:41.71,00:00:44.22
She's more. . . .[br]You know?

00:00:45.83,00:00:47.30
And you're more. . . .

00:00:48.67,00:00:52.10
Say you'll stay beside me

00:00:57.35,00:00:59.94
See? Everybody else is[br]happy she's done.

00:01:02.47,00:01:04.26
Okay, my next song's called:

00:01:04.51,00:01:07.42
"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?[br]I Loved When We Were. . .

00:01:07.67,00:01:10.82
. . .Singing Partners and I Shouldn't[br]Have Left You That Way. "

00:01:13.71,00:01:16.58

Hey, Phoebe.

00:02:07.47,00:02:08.26
Hey, Leslie.

00:02:08.71,00:02:10.10
How'd you know I'd be here?

00:02:10.35,00:02:13.06
I saw vlad at the place[br]where they sell the big fish.

00:02:13.27,00:02:14.94
He said you played here a lot, so. . . .

00:02:15.27,00:02:16.74
I have to go to the bathroom.

00:02:16.99,00:02:18.86
If "big-fish place"[br]comes up again. . .

00:02:19.11,00:02:23.02
. . .I'd like to know if that's several[br]big fish or just one big fish.

00:02:24.23,00:02:26.06
So Phoebe says you write jingles.

00:02:26.31,00:02:28.98
Actually, I said she abandoned me[br]to write jingles.

00:02:31.03,00:02:32.54
Anything we might've heard of?

00:02:34.79,00:02:36.82
Home is never far away

00:02:37.03,00:02:41.02
Home is Homestar Stew.

00:02:42.27,00:02:45.06
But I don't do that anymore.[br]I got kind of sick of it.

00:02:45.31,00:02:49.62
And then I couldn't come up with[br]anything good, so they fired me.

00:02:49.87,00:02:50.85
Bummer.

00:02:52.51,00:02:54.86
Well, you know, I was just. . . .

00:02:55.11,00:02:58.34
I was just thinking[br]and just hoping that. . .

00:02:59.27,00:03:01.50
. . .maybe you'd want[br]to get back together?

00:03:02.19,00:03:03.46
No, but, thanks.

00:03:03.67,00:03:05.94
Come on, Phoebe.[br]Would you just think about it?

00:03:08.63,00:03:10.02
No, but, thanks.

00:03:15.79,00:03:17.22
See you, Pheebs.

00:03:21.23,00:03:22.42
That was kind of brutal.

00:03:23.03,00:03:25.22
Let this be a lesson to all of you.

00:03:25.47,00:03:28.66
Once you betray me,[br]I become like the lce Woman.

00:03:28.91,00:03:33.62
I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.

00:03:33.83,00:03:37.14
You know, nothing can[br]penetrate this icy exterior.

00:03:37.35,00:03:38.62
Can I have a tissue?

00:03:45.31,00:03:46.82
Is someone in there?

00:03:48.43,00:03:50.06
I'm playing a daredevil game. . .

00:03:50.31,00:03:53.58
. . .called "Wait Until the Last Moment[br]Before I Burst and Die. "

00:03:54.11,00:03:55.46
Jeez, man! Did you fall--?

00:03:55.71,00:03:56.62
Hi!

00:03:57.71,00:04:00.54
So did you?[br]Did you fall high?

00:04:01.59,00:04:03.62
Someone was in the ladies' room.[br]I couldn't wait.

00:04:03.87,00:04:05.90
I left the lid up for you, though.

00:04:08.11,00:04:10.06
You know what, Gunther?[br]Go ahead.

00:04:10.31,00:04:12.22
I'm talking to. . . .

00:04:14.03,00:04:15.82
This is where you say your name.

00:04:16.07,00:04:16.86
Ginger.

00:04:17.07,00:04:19.37
Ginger.[br]I'm talking to Ginger, so. . .

00:04:22.83,00:04:24.82
Don't you have to use the bathroom?

00:04:26.51,00:04:28.78
No, I just--[br]I'd rather talk to you.

00:04:29.83,00:04:30.66
Yes, I do.

00:04:31.91,00:04:33.98
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.

00:04:34.79,00:04:36.62
There's someone in here.

00:04:38.23,00:04:40.18
-Where's Chandler?[br]-He can't make it.

00:04:40.39,00:04:42.95
He said he had to go back[br]to his job and--

00:04:45.71,00:04:46.62
Joey?

00:04:48.67,00:04:49.81
Joey Tribbiani?

00:04:55.67,00:04:57.42
I can see you, okay?

00:04:57.63,00:04:59.62
You're hiding behind the coats.

00:05:10.39,00:05:11.42
Close one.

00:05:17.03,00:05:17.82
Hi.

00:05:18.63,00:05:19.42
Hi, sweetie.

00:05:19.63,00:05:20.42
Hello.

00:05:21.31,00:05:22.22
Hey, Ross.

00:05:25.43,00:05:27.38
-I've got some bad news.[br]-What?

00:05:27.67,00:05:29.82
I can eat,[br]but I have to come back here.

00:05:30.07,00:05:33.02
Come on. You've worked late[br]every night for two weeks.

00:05:33.23,00:05:35.86
-What is it now?[br]-It's my fault. I quit today.

00:05:36.11,00:05:37.94
But work comes first!

00:05:38.39,00:05:41.34
But that's sad about you, though.[br]What happened?

00:05:41.59,00:05:44.94
What happened? Burn out?[br]Burn all out, did you?

00:05:46.83,00:05:48.86
He's leaving for a better job.

00:05:49.11,00:05:52.02
That's great.[br]So I guess this is goodbye then.

00:05:52.27,00:05:53.25
Goodbye.

00:05:55.67,00:05:56.65
Okay, then.

00:05:57.47,00:05:59.62
Well, we're gonna[br]miss you around here.

00:06:00.11,00:06:01.02
Yeah, me too.

00:06:03.99,00:06:06.62
-So see you on Saturday.[br]-Yeah, you bet!

00:06:25.31,00:06:27.74
Now, you know those[br]are a delicacy in lndia.

00:06:29.31,00:06:32.62
That was Leslie calling[br]to see if we can get back together.

00:06:32.87,00:06:36.82
It's like the 20th time today.[br]Yeah, good luck, Leslie.

00:06:38.11,00:06:39.54
She must've hurt you bad.

00:06:39.75,00:06:42.46
Well, yeah.[br]You know, we were best friends. . .

00:06:42.71,00:06:46.22
. . .ever since we were little.[br]Our moms worked on the barge together.

00:06:47.31,00:06:49.98
You two must've been so cute,[br]running around on a barge.

00:06:50.19,00:06:52.22
You never run on a barge!

00:06:56.51,00:06:58.06
Is Chandler around?

00:06:58.31,00:07:00.54
He met some girl at the coffeehouse.

00:07:01.27,00:07:02.25
Ginger something.

00:07:05.91,00:07:10.26
Sure it wasn't something that sounded[br]liked Ginger? Like "Gingeer"?

00:07:11.79,00:07:13.01
No, it was Ginger.

00:07:13.27,00:07:15.26
I remember because[br]when he told me, I said:

00:07:15.51,00:07:17.62
The movie star

00:07:18.71,00:07:19.50
Oh, man!

00:07:19.83,00:07:21.74
That's the girl I was hiding from.

00:07:21.99,00:07:24.50
When she sees he's my roommate,[br]she'll tell him what I did.

00:07:24.71,00:07:25.62
What did you do?

00:07:26.31,00:07:27.94
Oh, no! I can't. . . .

00:07:29.23,00:07:33.22
I can't tell you. It's the[br]most awful thing I've ever done.

00:07:33.43,00:07:34.54
Don't tell us.

00:07:34.75,00:07:38.22
We'll wait till Chandler gets home.[br]It'll be more fun that way.

00:07:40.11,00:07:42.67
It was, like, four years ago.

00:07:42.91,00:07:45.78
Ginger and I had gone out a few times.[br]Then one weekend. . .

00:07:45.99,00:07:47.42
. . .we went to her Dad's cabin. . .

00:07:47.67,00:07:51.42
. . .just me, her and her[br]annoying little dog, Pepper.

00:07:51.67,00:07:54.54
That night I cooked[br]this really romantic dinner--

00:07:54.75,00:07:56.62
You gave her food poisoning!

00:07:57.07,00:07:58.02
I wish.

00:07:59.31,00:08:02.93
After dinner, me, her and Pepper[br]fell asleep in front of the fire.

00:08:03.31,00:08:07.46
I woke up in the middle of the night[br]and saw the fire was dying out. . .

00:08:07.71,00:08:10.14
. . .so I picked up a log[br]and threw it on.

00:08:12.11,00:08:13.82
Or what I thought was a log.

00:08:14.07,00:08:16.50
Oh, my God![br]You threw Pepper on the fire!

00:08:17.43,00:08:18.41
I wish.

00:08:20.71,00:08:24.18
Another thing I probably[br]should've told you about Ginger. . .

00:08:24.39,00:08:26.58
. . .is that she kind of has a. . .

00:08:27.31,00:08:28.34
. . .artificial leg.

00:08:34.23,00:08:35.62
Oh, my God!

00:08:37.39,00:08:40.42
What did you do after[br]you threw her leg on the fire?

00:08:41.31,00:08:42.26
I ran!

00:08:51.23,00:08:53.22
That's the best kiss I've had. . .

00:08:53.43,00:08:55.81
. . .with anybody I met[br]in a men's room.

00:08:56.83,00:08:57.94
Actually, me too.

00:08:59.99,00:09:01.94
Foot all in the puddle!

00:09:02.19,00:09:03.94
Damn! I hate that!

00:09:04.15,00:09:07.06
-You'll have to get out of those shoes.[br]-Don't worry.

00:09:07.35,00:09:09.10
No, really.[br]You're gonna freeze.

00:09:09.31,00:09:10.58
No, I'm not.

00:09:12.91,00:09:15.62
You're not?[br]Have you got a bionic foot?

00:09:16.79,00:09:18.46
Someday. Maybe.

00:09:28.95,00:09:30.06
Funny book?

00:09:31.91,00:09:35.22
I'm just thinking about[br]something funny I heard today.

00:09:36.67,00:09:39.42
Mark saying,[br]"I'll see you Saturday. "

00:09:41.51,00:09:42.73
Yeah, at the lecture.

00:09:42.99,00:09:45.74
I told you last week.[br]You said you didn't mind.

00:09:45.99,00:09:48.70
It's not the lecture I mind.

00:09:49.67,00:09:52.82
Please tell me it's not because[br]I'm going with Mark.

00:09:53.51,00:09:55.22
-Well--[br]-Oh, my God!

00:09:56.15,00:09:59.34
I'm sorry, but if you're not[br]working with him anymore. . .

00:09:59.55,00:10:01.42
. . .why do you still hang out?

00:10:01.67,00:10:03.26
Because he's my friend.

00:10:03.87,00:10:06.86
But do you really need[br]another "friend"?

00:10:09.23,00:10:12.82
If I stop playing with Joey[br]and Chandler, can I play with Mark?

00:10:13.39,00:10:15.90
Is that funny?[br]Am I suppose to be laughing?

00:10:16.11,00:10:19.62
I don't know. You thought[br]"See you Saturday" was funny.

00:10:20.23,00:10:21.45
Mark is in fashion.

00:10:21.71,00:10:24.62
I like having a friend[br]I can share this stuff with.

00:10:24.83,00:10:27.82
You guys would never[br]go to a lecture with me.

00:10:30.11,00:10:31.54
I'd love to go with you.

00:10:31.75,00:10:32.54
Really?

00:10:33.03,00:10:34.62
I have clothes.

00:10:34.87,00:10:36.26
I even pick them out.

00:10:36.51,00:10:39.82
For all you know,[br]I could be a fashion. . .

00:10:40.59,00:10:41.54
: : :monger:

00:10:46.87,00:10:49.22
I would love for you to go with me.

00:10:49.79,00:10:50.66
What?

00:10:51.51,00:10:53.81
What should I wear?[br]Now I'm all nervous.

00:11:03.51,00:11:06.66
You know, they say[br]"A watched pot never beeps. "

00:11:09.63,00:11:11.42
It's been a couple hours. . .

00:11:12.23,00:11:13.82
. . .and she hasn't called.

00:11:14.67,00:11:16.62
Not that I even care. I don't.

00:11:17.43,00:11:19.26
Why don't you just call her?

00:11:19.51,00:11:21.42
You obviously want to.

00:11:21.67,00:11:23.62
You think you know me so well.

00:11:23.91,00:11:25.46
Well, don't you wanna?

00:11:27.83,00:11:29.34
So I do know you.

00:11:29.59,00:11:31.02
That's what I said.

00:11:33.23,00:11:34.02
Well, so?

00:11:34.51,00:11:35.62
I can't.

00:11:36.11,00:11:38.22
I can't. She dumped me.

00:11:38.47,00:11:40.82
I totally trusted her,[br]then one day it was like:

00:11:41.03,00:11:42.98
"Okay, bye, Pheebs. "[br]Gone!

00:11:44.59,00:11:46.66
You know what the saddest part is?

00:11:46.91,00:11:49.21
When we were playing together,[br]that was. . .

00:11:49.47,00:11:52.42
. . .the most fun I've ever had[br]in all my lives.

00:11:54.39,00:11:59.02
My favorite shoes, so good to me[br]I wear them every day

00:11:59.27,00:12:04.02
Down at the heel, holes in the toes[br]Don 't care what people say

00:12:04.27,00:12:06.94
My feet's best friend[br]Pals to the end

00:12:07.19,00:12:09.65
With them, I'm one hot chickie

00:12:09.91,00:12:13.18
Though late one night[br]Not much light

00:12:13.39,00:12:16.82
I stepped in something icky

00:12:19.51,00:12:22.14
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes

00:12:22.39,00:12:24.82
Always make me smile

00:12:25.03,00:12:29.86
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes[br]Next time I'll...

00:12:30.87,00:12:33.54
...avoid the...

00:12:33.79,00:12:35.42
...pile!

00:12:43.91,00:12:48.26
We're beginning to see a lot of[br]layering of sheer fabrics and colors.

00:12:48.51,00:12:51.62
For instance, a sheer navy blouse[br]over a pink. . . .

00:12:51.83,00:12:54.21
I'm really glad we came.

00:12:59.07,00:12:59.98
You're so pretty.

00:13:03.31,00:13:04.62
I love you.

00:13:08.15,00:13:10.86
Smelly cat, smelly cat

00:13:11.11,00:13:13.74
What are they feeding you?

00:13:13.99,00:13:17.10
Smelly cat, smelly cat

00:13:17.35,00:13:19.91
It's not your fault

00:13:22.47,00:13:23.26
That's great!

00:13:24.11,00:13:26.22
You know, you could totally sell this.

00:13:26.43,00:13:30.21
It'd be perfect for, like,[br]a kitty-litter campaign.

00:13:31.03,00:13:32.82
A jingle?

00:13:33.39,00:13:34.94
Why not?[br]You'd make a ton of money.

00:13:35.15,00:13:38.46
If I was in this for the money,[br]I'd be a millionaire by now.

00:13:40.15,00:13:42.42
You gotta get out of[br]that jingle-head.

00:13:43.91,00:13:46.06
You're right.[br]You're right. I'm sorry.

00:13:46.27,00:13:47.06
That's okay.

00:13:47.31,00:13:50.42
I'm gonna play a song now[br]that's really, really sad.

00:13:50.63,00:13:53.42
It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up. "

00:13:58.55,00:14:01.06
Oversized bracelets,[br]oversized earrings. . .

00:14:01.31,00:14:05.18
. . .oversizing of accessories,[br]in general, is very popular now.

00:14:17.23,00:14:19.42
Can I borrow this?[br]My milk's gone bad.

00:14:19.67,00:14:20.62
I hate that.

00:14:20.87,00:14:23.98
I once had a thing of half-and-half.[br]Stole my car.

00:14:26.27,00:14:28.70
So how was your date with Ginger?

00:14:30.03,00:14:30.82
Great.

00:14:31.47,00:14:32.94
It was great. She's. . . .

00:14:33.19,00:14:35.98
She's great. Great looks[br]and personality. Greatness.

00:14:38.07,00:14:40.02
Sounds like she's got the. . .

00:14:40.51,00:14:41.86
. . .whole package.

00:14:43.19,00:14:45.42
Joey told you about the leg, huh?

00:14:47.19,00:14:49.02
Oh, God![br]It freaked me out.

00:14:49.27,00:14:50.82
It shouldn't, but it did.

00:14:51.03,00:14:53.46
I wanna keep seeing her,[br]but it's like:

00:14:53.71,00:14:56.01
"Hey, you know what?[br]Where's your leg?"

00:15:00.47,00:15:04.01
I'm the smallest person in the world,[br]aren't l?

00:15:04.27,00:15:05.10
Morning.

00:15:05.67,00:15:08.42
Actually, he's the smallest person[br]in the world.

00:15:14.11,00:15:16.06
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?

00:15:18.59,00:15:19.73
It came up.

00:15:20.87,00:15:23.22
Listen, I know it's a long shot, but. . .

00:15:24.75,00:15:27.42
. . .by any chance,[br]did she find that funny?

00:15:31.87,00:15:33.46
So I nodded off a little!

00:15:33.71,00:15:36.54
"Nodded off"?[br]Ross, you were snoring!

00:15:36.79,00:15:40.82
My father's boat didn't make[br]that much noise when it hit rocks!

00:15:41.03,00:15:43.33
Come on! Forty-five minutes. . . .

00:15:43.59,00:15:47.54
Forty-five minutes, the man talked[br]about strappy-backed dresses.

00:15:48.71,00:15:53.06
Okay, how about four hours[br]in a freezing museum auditorium. . .

00:15:53.31,00:15:55.46
. . .Iistening to[br]Professor "Pitstains" say:

00:15:55.71,00:15:58.94
"Remember that thing that died[br]a gazillion years ago?

00:15:59.19,00:16:02.34
Well, here's a little bone[br]we didn't know it had! "

00:16:05.63,00:16:09.41
First of all, it's Professor Pitain.

00:16:09.99,00:16:12.42
And second of all,[br]that little bone proved that. . .

00:16:12.63,00:16:15.86
. . .that particular dinosaur had wings[br]but didn't fly.

00:16:16.07,00:16:18.10
Okay, you know what I just heard?

00:16:22.71,00:16:26.86
A hundred million people[br]went to see a movie about what I do.

00:16:27.11,00:16:31.46
I wonder how many people would go see[br]a movie called Jurassic Parka.

00:16:31.71,00:16:33.62
Oh, that is so--

00:16:33.83,00:16:38.22
A bunch of out-of-control jackets[br]take over an island!

00:16:44.27,00:16:46.34
If what I do is so lame. . .

00:16:46.55,00:16:50.02
. . .then why did you insist on coming[br]with me this morning?

00:16:50.27,00:16:53.02
Was it so I just wouldn't[br]go with Mark?

00:16:55.31,00:16:57.42
I wanted to be with you.

00:16:58.19,00:17:00.22
I don't know, I feel like lately. . .

00:17:00.47,00:17:02.34
. . .you're slipping away from me. . .

00:17:02.55,00:17:04.85
. . .with this new job[br]and all these new people.

00:17:05.11,00:17:07.70
And you've got this[br]whole other life going on.

00:17:07.91,00:17:09.82
I know it's dumb. . .

00:17:10.07,00:17:13.98
. . .but I just hate[br]that I'm not a part of it.

00:17:18.27,00:17:19.62
It's not dumb.

00:17:21.27,00:17:24.22
But maybe it's okay[br]that you're not a part of it.

00:17:24.47,00:17:25.61
You know what I mean?

00:17:27.11,00:17:28.17
I mean, it's like. . .

00:17:28.39,00:17:32.42
. . .I like that you're not[br]involved in that part of my life.

00:17:33.19,00:17:34.82
That's a little clearer.

00:17:36.07,00:17:38.66
See, it doesn't mean[br]I don't love you. . .

00:17:38.91,00:17:41.98
. . .because I do.[br]I love you so much.

00:17:42.19,00:17:44.46
But my work--[br]It's for me, you know?

00:17:44.71,00:17:47.06
I'm out there on my own,[br]and I'm doing it.

00:17:47.31,00:17:51.22
And it's scary,[br]but I love it because it's mine.

00:17:52.07,00:17:54.02
But I mean, is that okay?

00:17:54.43,00:17:55.22
Sure.

00:18:05.31,00:18:07.18
You're thinking about my leg.

00:18:09.27,00:18:11.98
Actually, I forgot.[br]What's the deal with that again?

00:18:12.19,00:18:14.86
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.

00:18:15.11,00:18:17.82
I only need to know[br]how much it bothers you. . .

00:18:18.07,00:18:20.22
. . .because I don't like[br]wasting my time.

00:18:21.07,00:18:22.38
Am I wasting my time?

00:18:24.03,00:18:25.62
No, I don't think so.

00:18:26.79,00:18:30.02
It's like anything else.[br]You just have to get used to it.

00:18:42.03,00:18:42.90
What's that?

00:18:44.31,00:18:46.02
That's my "nubbin. "

00:18:50.63,00:18:52.02
What's a nubbin?

00:18:53.23,00:18:57.01
It's kind of a third-nipple[br]kind of thing.

00:18:58.59,00:19:00.06
You have three nipples?

00:19:00.27,00:19:02.22
Well, you know, two regulars. . .

00:19:02.79,00:19:06.06
. . .and one that[br]barely qualifies as a--

00:19:08.79,00:19:09.58
What?

00:19:09.83,00:19:11.34
Nothing. You know, l. . . .

00:19:11.59,00:19:13.62
I just remembered.[br]I have to leave.

00:19:13.87,00:19:17.14
You have to leave? Now? How come?

00:19:17.35,00:19:19.06
Well, it's nubbin.[br]Nothing!

00:19:20.91,00:19:24.14
You know what?[br]I'll see you later.

00:19:32.31,00:19:33.66
I thought you weren't coming.

00:19:34.19,00:19:36.22
-Where were you?[br]-Come here, come here.

00:19:38.07,00:19:39.18
Don't get mad, okay?

00:19:39.39,00:19:42.02
Don't give me a reason to get mad,[br]okay?

00:19:42.67,00:19:46.45
I played Smelly Cat for[br]my old ad agency. They went nuts!

00:19:46.67,00:19:49.86
I told you I didn't want you[br]to try and sell it. . .

00:19:50.11,00:19:53.26
. . .and you just big, fat did it anyway!

00:19:54.87,00:19:58.57
I think, five years ago,[br]I probably would have done anything. . .

00:19:58.79,00:20:00.14
. . .to play with you.

00:20:00.39,00:20:03.62
But I can do it myself.[br]If I can't trust you, then forget it.

00:20:04.11,00:20:05.54
I don't wanna forget it.

00:20:05.75,00:20:07.42
You know what?[br]You have to choose.

00:20:07.63,00:20:10.62
If the most important thing[br]on the planet to you. . .

00:20:10.83,00:20:15.74
. . .is this cat-poopy thing,[br]then you can have Smelly Cat.

00:20:15.99,00:20:17.82
But we won't be partners.

00:20:18.47,00:20:19.86
So what's it gonna be?

00:20:20.07,00:20:23.22
-Smelly cat, smelly cat[br]-Problem odor in the litter box?

00:20:23.43,00:20:26.58
Don 't change your kitty,[br]change your kitty litter.

00:20:27.03,00:20:29.26
It's not your fault

00:20:31.63,00:20:32.58
Sorry, Pheebs.

00:20:34.43,00:20:35.62
You okay?

00:20:37.19,00:20:38.46
I actually am.

00:20:38.67,00:20:42.21
Because, you know, life's gonna[br]hand you all kinds of stuff.

00:20:42.47,00:20:45.34
You learn your little lessons[br]and hopefully you grow.

00:20:46.47,00:20:49.03
-You wanna hear a new song?[br]-We'd love to.

00:20:51.71,00:20:53.38
Jingle bitch screwed me over

00:20:55.47,00:20:57.02
Go to hell, jingle whore

00:20:57.27,00:21:01.10
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell

00:21:01.71,00:21:03.66
That's all I have so far.

00:21:08.63,00:21:10.02
Well, hello!

00:21:11.11,00:21:12.82
-Where you been?[br]-The doctor.

00:21:13.03,00:21:14.38
Is everything okay?

00:21:14.59,00:21:17.02
Just had me[br]a little nubbin-ectomy.

00:21:20.51,00:21:22.18
Two nipples, no waiting.

00:21:22.39,00:21:25.62
Well! Just like Rachel[br]in high school.

00:21:26.87,00:21:27.85
What?

00:21:28.67,00:21:31.74
Come on, I was kidding![br]It was such an obvious joke.

00:21:31.95,00:21:33.66
That was an obvious joke.

00:21:33.91,00:21:35.82
And I didn't think of it. Why?

00:21:37.07,00:21:39.02
The source of all my powers.

00:21:40.67,00:21:43.02
Oh, dear God, what have I done?

00:00:03.14,00:00:06.06
-Previously on Friends. . . .[br]-I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.

00:00:06.30,00:00:09.18
You want me to quit my job so you[br]can feel like you have a girlfriend?

00:00:09.42,00:00:11.18
-Is this about Mark?[br]-Oh, my God.

00:00:11.42,00:00:13.62
-Okay, it's not.[br]-Oh, my God.

00:00:13.90,00:00:15.90
I cannot keep having this[br]fight with you!

00:00:16.14,00:00:18.26
Maybe we should just take a break.

00:00:18.50,00:00:20.50
Fine. You're right.[br]Let's take a break.

00:00:20.74,00:00:23.50
Let's get some frozen yogurt[br]or something.

00:00:24.58,00:00:26.34
A break from us.

00:00:28.54,00:00:31.90
Then we had this big fight,[br]and I said I wanted to take a break.

00:00:32.22,00:00:33.78
I don't want to take a break.

00:00:34.02,00:00:35.06
This is crazy.

00:00:35.30,00:00:36.90
Can 't we work on this?

00:00:37.18,00:00:38.06
What do you want to drink?

00:00:38.58,00:00:39.38
Who's that?

00:00:40.98,00:00:41.78
Nobody.

00:00:42.78,00:00:43.58
Is that Mark?

00:00:43.78,00:00:44.90
Honey, look, he just--

00:00:45.26,00:00:46.41
Yeah. Got it!

00:00:47.86,00:00:50.66
Hey, come dance.[br]What, are you married?

00:00:50.98,00:00:52.58
Because that's okay.

00:01:03.70,00:01:06.01
THE NEXT MORNING

00:01:08.26,00:01:10.33
How was the big anniversary dinner?

00:01:10.54,00:01:13.78
Well, we never actually got to dinner.

00:01:14.42,00:01:15.30
Nice.

00:01:17.34,00:01:18.98
We kind of broke up instead.

00:01:19.22,00:01:20.10
What?

00:01:23.62,00:01:25.58
My God![br]It's on the ceiling!

00:01:25.82,00:01:26.78
That's okay.

00:01:27.06,00:01:29.02
This is more important than fruit. . .

00:01:29.42,00:01:30.70
. . .on my ceiling.

00:01:32.38,00:01:33.18
You broke up?

00:01:33.42,00:01:37.42
Yeah, but it's okay because[br]when Ross left, Mark came over.

00:01:37.66,00:01:40.05
-Oh, no! You and Mark?[br]-It's okay. Calm down.

00:01:40.30,00:01:41.62
Mark and I talked. . .

00:01:41.86,00:01:45.90
. . .and I realized how much[br]I love your stupid brother.

00:01:46.38,00:01:49.46
We got our problems,[br]but I really wanna make it work.

00:02:06.18,00:02:07.17
Morning!

00:02:12.30,00:02:14.50
The One the Morning After

00:03:02.06,00:03:05.98
It's me. I've been trying[br]to reach you all night. I feel awful.

00:03:06.18,00:03:09.10
There's nothing between me and Mark.

00:03:09.34,00:03:12.58
This whole breakup thing[br]is just stupid.

00:03:14.62,00:03:16.77
I'm sorry I put you through it.

00:03:17.02,00:03:20.38
And I don 't want to get[br]back together over a machine.

00:03:20.94,00:03:22.38
So I love you.

00:03:22.58,00:03:23.38
I love you.

00:03:23.58,00:03:26.78
And you know what?[br]I'm gonna go to bed now...

00:03:27.02,00:03:31.62
...but on my way to work tomorrow,[br]I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.

00:03:34.74,00:03:36.02
Chloe, how's it coming?

00:03:36.26,00:03:38.57
What kind of puppy do you think[br]I should get?

00:03:38.78,00:03:40.66
Well, how about a big one?

00:03:40.98,00:03:43.37
-But my apartment's so--[br]-Then a small one.

00:03:43.58,00:03:45.89
-We have to go.[br]-Wait! Where's my shoes?

00:03:46.14,00:03:47.18
You need shoes?

00:03:50.46,00:03:54.09
-Do I know why we're rushing?[br]-You know my girlfriend?

00:03:54.34,00:03:57.22
It turns out that she wants[br]to get back together.

00:03:57.46,00:03:58.37
I found it!

00:03:58.58,00:04:00.58
That's so great for you guys!

00:04:00.86,00:04:02.22
You must be so happy!

00:04:02.42,00:04:05.18
Yes, I am. One of the many[br]things I'm feeling.

00:04:07.34,00:04:10.02
-Good luck with your girlfriend.[br]-Thank you.

00:04:18.82,00:04:21.74
-You got my message?[br]-You are right on time!

00:04:22.14,00:04:24.29
So can I be your girlfriend again?

00:04:24.58,00:04:25.98
Yes, you can. very much.

00:04:34.18,00:04:37.57
-Why are you mopping your ceiling?[br]-There's banana on it.

00:04:38.62,00:04:41.98
I have the spirit of an[br]old lndian woman living in mine.

00:04:43.26,00:04:44.22
So, then, you know.

00:04:47.42,00:04:49.49
The mailman was here,[br]so I brought your mail.

00:04:49.74,00:04:52.74
-Oh, good. Thanks.[br]-Now, what is Fabutech?

00:04:53.30,00:04:55.86
Don't judge me too much, okay?

00:04:56.10,00:04:59.38
I saw this infomercial,[br]and I swear I have never. . .

00:04:59.58,00:05:01.70
. . .bought anything on Tv before.

00:05:01.94,00:05:03.66
Except for this mop.

00:05:04.38,00:05:06.69
But there was this amazing stuff[br]on leg-waxing--

00:05:06.94,00:05:07.82
Waxine!

00:05:08.06,00:05:09.38
Yes! Have you seen it?

00:05:09.62,00:05:12.06
It's incredible![br]I want to be a Waxine Girl!

00:05:12.30,00:05:13.45
I know!

00:05:14.78,00:05:18.06
Do you think it really doesn't hurt?[br]How can they do that?

00:05:18.30,00:05:21.54
Hello! Organic substances recently[br]discovered in the rain forest?

00:05:22.06,00:05:24.34
They have the best stuff in there.

00:05:25.62,00:05:26.94
Oh, my God!

00:05:28.26,00:05:29.62
Oh, my God!

00:05:30.54,00:05:34.38
We figured when we couldn't find you,[br]you'd gone to make up with Rachel.

00:05:34.62,00:05:36.66
Which is probably what[br]you should have done.

00:05:38.18,00:05:39.01
You think?

00:05:40.58,00:05:43.89
God, I'm in hell.[br]I mean, what am I gonna do?

00:05:44.14,00:05:48.02
Rachel's all "I love you,"[br]and all I can think about. . .

00:05:48.26,00:05:50.98
. . .is what is she gonna do[br]when I tell her what I did?

00:05:51.26,00:05:54.78
First, we should address[br]the more important question. . .

00:05:54.98,00:05:56.34
. . .how dumb are you?

00:05:58.42,00:06:02.10
Look, we're trying to[br]rebuild a relationship here, right?

00:06:02.34,00:06:04.78
How can I do that[br]without being honest?

00:06:05.02,00:06:08.18
I'm onboard about[br]the total-honesty thing. I am.

00:06:08.38,00:06:11.77
Just not about stuff that's[br]gonna get you in trouble.

00:06:12.26,00:06:15.22
He's right. Nobody benefits,[br]and you'll just hurt her.

00:06:15.46,00:06:18.18
And there won't be a relationship[br]left to rebuild.

00:06:18.38,00:06:19.26
Don't you think--

00:06:19.50,00:06:22.81
If you have to tell her,[br]at least wait till the timing's right.

00:06:23.06,00:06:24.98
And that's what deathbeds are for.

00:06:27.78,00:06:29.70
-Yeah, okay.[br]-All right.

00:06:30.02,00:06:34.86
Okay. Now, we just have to make sure[br]she doesn't find out some other way.

00:06:36.06,00:06:38.18
Did you think about the trail?

00:06:40.18,00:06:41.01
What trail?

00:06:43.46,00:06:44.98
From the woman[br]you did it with. . .

00:06:45.22,00:06:48.38
. . .to the woman you hope[br]never finds out you did it!

00:06:49.10,00:06:50.94
Always think about the trail!

00:06:52.66,00:06:54.97
I don't think there's any trail.

00:06:56.74,00:06:59.02
Chloe works with that guy, lsaac.

00:06:59.22,00:07:03.18
Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works[br]at the massage place with Phoebe.

00:07:03.38,00:07:06.26
Phoebe is Rachel's friend,[br]and that's the trail! I did it!

00:07:09.02,00:07:11.82
"After applying the Waxine[br]and linen strips to leg--"

00:07:12.06,00:07:13.13
Did that!

00:07:14.22,00:07:16.58
"Grasp the linen strip by its tab. . .

00:07:16.82,00:07:19.58
. . .and pull it off in one quick,[br]pain-free motion. "

00:07:23.94,00:07:25.38
Was it not "pain-free"?

00:07:26.66,00:07:28.42
No, it was pain-ful!

00:07:28.66,00:07:32.10
My God, they should call it[br]"Pain-zine, now with a little wax. "

00:07:33.66,00:07:37.37
The girls on the commercial[br]don't seem to think it's that bad.

00:07:37.58,00:07:40.58
Because their nerves are[br]deadened from being so stupid.

00:07:42.26,00:07:46.30
But you know, if you don't[br]believe me, please, be my guest.

00:07:50.82,00:07:53.78
Now are you glad we didn't start[br]with the bikini strips?

00:07:59.34,00:08:00.46
Chloe, hi.

00:08:01.46,00:08:03.46
Is this about me taking your watch?

00:08:04.46,00:08:07.46
-You took my watch?[br]-I'm sorry. I do that.

00:08:08.26,00:08:11.62
You keep it. Listen, did you[br]tell anyone about us?

00:08:11.86,00:08:14.82
I feel like it really isn't[br]anybody's business.

00:08:15.06,00:08:18.06
Exactly. So you didn't[br]mention anything to lsaac?

00:08:18.30,00:08:21.82
-I tell lsaac everything.[br]-You do? Of course you do.

00:08:23.94,00:08:27.02
Hi, lsaac.[br]You know, we haven't actually met.

00:08:27.26,00:08:28.74
You dog!

00:08:31.46,00:08:35.70
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But see,[br]I happen to have a girlfriend.

00:08:35.94,00:08:38.06
Right. Rachel from the coffee place.

00:08:38.30,00:08:40.98
That's the one.[br]Listen, I don't want to hurt her.

00:08:41.22,00:08:43.82
I know. It doesn't matter[br]how much we love them.

00:08:44.06,00:08:46.50
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.

00:08:49.14,00:08:52.58
Listen, can you keep this[br]information to yourself?

00:08:52.82,00:08:55.10
No problem.[br]We gotta look out for each other.

00:08:55.34,00:08:57.02
We're the same, you and me.

00:09:00.06,00:09:02.50
Actually, no, we're not.

00:09:02.74,00:09:04.02
Yeah, we are.

00:09:04.66,00:09:06.30
No, we're not.

00:09:06.54,00:09:07.77
Yeah, we are.

00:09:09.06,00:09:10.02
No, we're not.

00:09:10.26,00:09:12.49
-Okay, we're not.[br]-Right.

00:09:12.74,00:09:13.54
But we are.

00:09:16.26,00:09:19.57
Fine. I just need to know[br]that you won't tell your sister.

00:09:20.34,00:09:22.57
I can promise not to tell her again.

00:09:26.58,00:09:30.50
Jasmine? We met at Phoebe's[br]birthday party. I'm Ross Geller.

00:09:31.14,00:09:32.90
You did a bad thing!

00:09:34.22,00:09:35.62
-Yes, I did.[br]-very bad!

00:09:35.86,00:09:37.66
-very bad.[br]-very, very bad!

00:09:38.62,00:09:39.82
I'm agreeing with you.

00:09:40.06,00:09:42.50
Listen, did you happen[br]to tell Phoebe yet?

00:09:45.18,00:09:47.49
Please. Please don't.

00:09:47.74,00:09:52.02
I love my girlfriend very much[br]and I want to work it out with her.

00:09:54.06,00:09:54.94
All right.

00:09:55.54,00:09:57.02
Thank you. Thank you.

00:09:57.26,00:10:01.10
But you should talk to my roommate.[br]I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.

00:10:01.54,00:10:02.69
Who's your roommate?

00:10:05.62,00:10:10.30
Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about[br]me and the girl from the copy place.

00:10:10.82,00:10:12.10
I'm sorry.

00:10:12.34,00:10:14.06
Was I not supposed to?

00:10:33.94,00:10:36.94
-We're all right.[br]-It's okay. It's okay.

00:10:37.86,00:10:40.38
-We were just waxing our legs.[br]-Off?

00:10:42.30,00:10:46.46
For your information, this is a pain[br]like no man will ever experience.

00:10:46.70,00:10:49.30
Unless you've been kicked in an area. . .

00:10:49.54,00:10:52.18
. . .that God only meant[br]to be treated nicely.

00:10:53.06,00:10:56.98
Women just have a lower threshold[br]for pain than men, that's all.

00:10:57.18,00:10:59.65
I mean, come on,[br]it's just a little wax.

00:11:00.26,00:11:01.49
Oh, yeah? Come here.

00:11:03.54,00:11:04.90
Oh, that's mature.

00:11:06.62,00:11:08.38
So now I just pull it off?

00:11:08.62,00:11:09.58
That's right.

00:11:16.70,00:11:18.18
Just talk to me.[br]Please!

00:11:18.38,00:11:21.30
Talk to you?[br]I can't even look at you right now.

00:11:22.26,00:11:23.90
Nothing. Nothing.

00:11:24.66,00:11:27.50
-She said it was okay.[br]-What are they talking about?

00:11:29.10,00:11:32.10
-Just get away from me![br]-I made a mistake, okay?

00:11:32.34,00:11:36.18
A mistake? What were you trying[br]to put it in? Her purse?

00:11:38.46,00:11:40.46
Where did he put it?

00:11:43.54,00:11:45.66
You had sex with another woman!

00:11:46.26,00:11:47.78
Oh, my God!

00:11:47.98,00:11:52.26
I knew something was wrong because[br]my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.

00:11:53.74,00:11:56.46
I guess they had a fight,[br]and he got drunk--

00:11:56.86,00:11:59.38
You guys knew about this[br]and didn't tell us?

00:11:59.58,00:12:01.97
He has sex and we get hit[br]in our heads!

00:12:02.54,00:12:04.90
I want you to leave![br]Just get out! Now!

00:12:05.14,00:12:06.90
I want to stay and talk about this.

00:12:08.26,00:12:09.94
All right. How was she?

00:12:15.26,00:12:16.78
-What?[br]-Was she good?

00:12:16.98,00:12:17.97
Don't answer that.

00:12:21.14,00:12:24.50
You said you wanted to talk about it.[br]Let's talk. How was she?

00:12:25.86,00:12:27.22
-She was. . . .[br]-Awful.

00:12:27.46,00:12:30.42
-She was not good.[br]-Horrible. Nothing compared to you.

00:12:32.22,00:12:33.21
She was different.

00:12:36.34,00:12:37.74
Good different?

00:12:39.18,00:12:40.94
Nobody likes change.

00:12:42.06,00:12:44.45
-Just stop![br]-What? Okay! Okay! Okay!

00:12:45.18,00:12:46.41
Should we do something?

00:12:46.66,00:12:48.73
Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.

00:12:50.86,00:12:54.46
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.[br]I was disgusted with myself. . .

00:12:54.70,00:12:56.14
. . .and this morning[br]I was upset. . .

00:12:56.46,00:12:58.82
. . .and then I got your[br]message and I was so happy.

00:12:59.06,00:13:01.98
And all I wanted was to get her out[br]of my apartment--

00:13:02.18,00:13:05.02
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa![br]Wait a minute.

00:13:06.58,00:13:09.05
What time did your[br]little friend leave?

00:13:12.82,00:13:15.58
Oh, my God. She was there?[br]She was still there?

00:13:15.82,00:13:18.78
She was in there when I was in there?

00:13:22.86,00:13:26.10
Listen, the important thing is[br]she meant nothing to me.

00:13:26.38,00:13:29.77
And yet she was worth[br]jeopardizing our relationship!

00:13:31.38,00:13:33.42
I didn't think there was[br]a relationship.

00:13:33.66,00:13:35.86
-We'd broken up.[br]-We were on a break.

00:13:36.10,00:13:39.49
That, for all I knew, could last[br]forever. That is a breakup.

00:13:39.74,00:13:41.38
You gonna get out of this[br]on a technicality?

00:13:41.62,00:13:43.82
I'm not trying to "get out"[br]of anything.

00:13:44.06,00:13:45.78
I thought our relationship was dead.

00:13:45.98,00:13:49.77
Well, you sure had a hell of a time[br]at the wake.

00:13:50.98,00:13:53.50
I don't think we should listen[br]to this anymore.

00:13:53.74,00:13:55.62
What are you doing?[br]We can't go out.

00:13:55.86,00:13:57.98
Why not? I'm hungry.

00:13:59.46,00:14:01.90
Because they'll know[br]we've been listening.

00:14:02.26,00:14:05.02
God! And to have to hear about it[br]from Gunther!

00:14:05.22,00:14:08.85
I ran all over the place trying[br]to make sure that didn't happen!

00:14:10.94,00:14:12.94
Oh, that is so sweet.

00:14:14.54,00:14:17.22
I think I'm falling in love with you[br]all over again.

00:14:19.54,00:14:22.78
We can go out. They have[br]other things to worry about.

00:14:23.02,00:14:24.09
We'll be fine.

00:14:24.30,00:14:27.61
Rachel, I wanted to tell you.[br]I thought I should.

00:14:27.86,00:14:31.38
And then Chandler and Joey[br]convinced me not to!

00:14:34.86,00:14:37.46
Wax the door shut.[br]We're never leaving.

00:14:38.94,00:14:42.57
It's Phoebe. Someone has to take[br]my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak. . .

00:14:42.78,00:14:45.66
. . .because it's 9: 1 5 now,[br]and I'm not there.

00:14:47.58,00:14:50.82
None of this would've happened[br]if I didn't think. . .

00:14:51.06,00:14:53.26
. . .you were having sex with Mark?

00:14:53.46,00:14:54.53
All right.

00:14:55.26,00:14:59.50
Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would[br]you have been able to forgive me?

00:15:01.98,00:15:03.58
Yes, I would.

00:15:06.02,00:15:10.18
You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me,[br]and been naked with me. . .

00:15:10.38,00:15:11.74
. . .and made love to me?

00:15:15.42,00:15:19.02
If you knew that our hot, sweaty,[br]writhing bodies were--

00:15:24.62,00:15:27.01
I would have been devastated. . .

00:15:27.54,00:15:29.74
. . .but I would still want[br]to be with you.

00:15:30.26,00:15:32.54
Because, I mean, it's you.

00:15:43.86,00:15:46.42
Come on, tell me what you're thinking.

00:15:49.06,00:15:50.74
I'm thinking. . .

00:15:53.38,00:15:55.22
. . .I'm gonna order a pizza.

00:15:58.34,00:15:59.90
Order a pizza, like. . .

00:16:00.94,00:16:02.58
. . . "I forgive you"?

00:16:07.62,00:16:08.61
Oh, man!

00:16:09.26,00:16:10.17
Pizza?

00:16:11.38,00:16:12.82
I like pizza.

00:16:14.46,00:16:16.53
Put olives on the pizza.

00:16:21.38,00:16:23.61
We could eat the wax! It's organic!

00:16:24.78,00:16:26.90
Oh, great. Food with hair on it.

00:16:28.66,00:16:30.30
No, not the used wax.

00:16:30.54,00:16:32.74
Because that would be crazy?

00:16:35.62,00:16:39.30
Could I get in on that?[br]Because I'm kind of hungry myself.

00:16:39.54,00:16:40.53
Fine.

00:16:40.86,00:16:43.42
Yes, I'd like to order[br]a large pizza.

00:16:43.66,00:16:46.70
-No anchovies.[br]-With extra anchovies.

00:16:47.62,00:16:48.98
That's okay.[br]I'll pick them off.

00:16:49.18,00:16:52.38
And could you chop some up[br]and put it right in the sauce?

00:16:58.82,00:17:00.82
You can have the last piece[br]if you want.

00:17:01.06,00:17:03.78
Well, I should think so.[br]You slept with someone.

00:17:15.86,00:17:18.38
They're gonna get through this,[br]aren't they?

00:17:18.74,00:17:21.42
Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.

00:17:21.66,00:17:22.54
They've got to.

00:17:24.46,00:17:25.74
What if they don't?

00:17:30.02,00:17:32.22
You think I need a new walk?

00:17:35.46,00:17:36.26
What?

00:17:36.50,00:17:40.18
Well, I've been walking[br]the same way since high school.

00:17:40.54,00:17:44.17
You know how some guys walk into[br]a room and everybody takes notice?

00:17:44.42,00:17:46.30
I think I need a take-notice walk.

00:17:47.26,00:17:49.26
Are you actually saying these words?

00:17:54.06,00:17:56.37
What, now you're not even[br]talking to me?

00:17:59.18,00:18:03.18
Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.[br]I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.

00:18:03.58,00:18:04.90
I thought I'd lost you.

00:18:05.14,00:18:08.02
How insane must I have been[br]to do something like this?

00:18:08.26,00:18:12.14
I don't cheat, right?[br]That's not me. I'm not Joey!

00:18:22.14,00:18:25.50
It's 3 a.m. They don't[br]know that I've come home yet.

00:18:25.74,00:18:28.58
You notice how they aren't[br]wondering where I am?

00:18:29.38,00:18:32.58
You know, people can be[br]so self-involved.

00:18:33.82,00:18:37.70
You know what? I'm not the one[br]that wanted that break.

00:18:37.94,00:18:40.41
You're the one that bailed.[br]You're the one. . .

00:18:40.66,00:18:42.73
. . .that ran the moment things[br]got rough.

00:18:42.94,00:18:44.01
-That's--[br]-That's what?

00:18:44.26,00:18:46.78
-That is neither here nor there.[br]-Here we are. . .

00:18:46.98,00:18:49.02
. . .in a spot again.[br]What do you want?

00:18:49.26,00:18:52.78
How do you want to handle it?[br]You want to fight for us or bail?

00:18:58.46,00:19:02.34
Look, I did a terrible,[br]stupid, stupid thing, okay?

00:19:02.82,00:19:06.21
I'm sorry. I wish I could[br]take it back, but I can't.

00:19:06.66,00:19:10.54
I just can't see us throwing away[br]something we know is so damn good.

00:19:11.54,00:19:13.58
I love you so much.

00:19:23.54,00:19:25.58
No, Ross! Don't!

00:19:25.78,00:19:29.02
You can't just kiss me and[br]make it all go away.

00:19:29.26,00:19:32.65
It doesn't work that way.[br]It doesn't just make it better.

00:19:37.74,00:19:39.66
I think you should go.

00:19:41.14,00:19:41.94
What?

00:19:42.66,00:19:45.18
I really think you need to go now.

00:19:50.14,00:19:53.30
This morning you said there was[br]nothing we couldn't work out.

00:19:53.54,00:19:55.10
What the hell did I know?

00:19:55.34,00:19:58.22
There's got to be a way we[br]can work past this.

00:19:58.46,00:20:01.26
I can't imagine my life without you.

00:20:05.34,00:20:06.41
Without these arms. . .

00:20:07.54,00:20:10.01
. . .and your face and heart. . .

00:20:10.22,00:20:12.22
. . .your good heart, Rach, and. . . .

00:20:18.66,00:20:21.66
I can't. You're a totally[br]different person to me now.

00:20:22.34,00:20:27.21
I used to think of you as somebody[br]that would never, ever hurt me.

00:20:27.46,00:20:28.53
Ever.

00:20:30.14,00:20:32.26
Now I can't stop picturing[br]you with her.

00:20:32.54,00:20:36.01
I can't. It doesn't matter what you[br]say or what you do.

00:20:36.26,00:20:38.73
It's just changed everything.

00:20:41.14,00:20:42.66
Forever.

00:20:53.22,00:20:54.66
This can't be it.

00:20:59.82,00:21:01.86
Then how come it is?

00:21:12.82,00:21:14.89
They've been quiet for a long time.

00:21:16.26,00:21:17.30
Maybe she killed him.

00:21:21.46,00:21:22.61
Let's go.

00:21:49.42,00:21:51.10
Is that your new walk?

00:21:55.46,00:21:57.34
I really have to pee.

00:00:05.03,00:00:06.62
Can I see the comics?

00:00:07.11,00:00:08.67
This is the New York Times.

00:00:09.79,00:00:11.86
Okay, may I see the comics?

00:00:13.43,00:00:15.87
I thought you were[br]taking Ross to the game.

00:00:16.07,00:00:19.22
-We are. He's meeting us here.[br]-No, Rachel's meeting us here!

00:00:19.43,00:00:21.18
Come on![br]They can be in the same room.

00:00:21.43,00:00:24.23
-You should've been there last night.[br]-What happened?

00:00:24.43,00:00:26.02
Ross was hanging out at our place.

00:00:26.27,00:00:29.58
Rachel comes over to borrow[br]some moisturizer from Chandler--

00:00:30.83,00:00:32.42
How hard is it to say "something"?

00:00:32.67,00:00:35.79
Rachel came over to borrow "something. "

00:00:37.07,00:00:40.30
Anyway, her and Ross just started[br]yelling at each other.

00:00:40.51,00:00:43.82
Why was he yelling at her?[br]He slept with someone else.

00:00:44.03,00:00:46.23
He says they were on a break[br]when it happened. . .

00:00:46.43,00:00:48.18
. . .so she should've[br]forgiven him by now.

00:00:48.43,00:00:51.31
He is so unreasonable! God!

00:00:51.55,00:00:53.54
Although I understand what he means.

00:00:54.83,00:00:57.30
Oh, my God![br]This is like 60 Minutes...

00:00:57.51,00:01:01.19
. . .when at first you're mad that[br]pharmaceutical company made the drug.

00:01:01.39,00:01:04.19
And then, you just feel bad[br]for the people, because. . .

00:01:04.39,00:01:06.86
. . .they needed[br]to make their hair grow.

00:01:07.27,00:01:10.58
You know, this is like[br]when my parents got divorced.

00:01:11.07,00:01:13.83
I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me[br]after Cub Scouts.

00:01:15.87,00:01:19.63
I dreamed that Ross and Rachel[br]were still together.

00:01:19.87,00:01:21.70
And we were all[br]hanging out and happy.

00:01:21.95,00:01:23.07
I had the same dream.

00:01:23.27,00:01:27.79
-And nobody slept with the xerox girl.[br]-Oh, I had the opposite dream.

00:01:28.87,00:01:31.78
Maybe it's gonna be okay.[br]I mean, it's been a week.

00:01:31.99,00:01:34.55
It never takes me more than a week[br]to get over a relationship.

00:01:34.75,00:01:37.74
It never takes you more than a shower[br]to get over a relationship.

00:01:40.63,00:01:43.99
Let's go! Let's hit the road.[br]Let's get the show on it.

00:01:44.23,00:01:45.11
Let me get coffee.

00:01:45.35,00:01:47.34
I know the best coffeehouse.[br]And it's close.

00:01:47.99,00:01:48.98
Closer than here?

00:01:49.75,00:01:51.82
Oh, look! I found coffee!

00:01:52.07,00:01:53.39
Okay, let's skedaddle.

00:01:53.59,00:01:55.98
I'm not gonna drink[br]somebody's old coffee.

00:01:56.19,00:01:57.75
Okay, Your Highness.

00:02:05.19,00:02:09.39
"Rachel, I'm really sorry. "[br]"Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"

00:02:09.59,00:02:10.47
"Yeah, okay. "

00:02:10.87,00:02:12.99
Did anyone else hear that?

00:02:14.99,00:02:17.03
The One Without the Ski Trip

00:02:18.27,00:02:19.26
Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:03:11.27,00:03:12.31
Is he here?

00:03:12.51,00:03:14.23
Here's your moisturizer.

00:03:17.67,00:03:20.58
You guys are gonna love me![br]Okay, check it out.

00:03:20.79,00:03:22.59
Thursday night, five tickets.

00:03:22.79,00:03:26.99
Calvin Klein lingerie show,[br]and you guys are coming with me.

00:03:30.15,00:03:32.19
I said that out loud, right?

00:03:32.67,00:03:35.82
Yes, it's just that[br]we kind of already. . .

00:03:36.07,00:03:37.98
. . .made plans with Ross.

00:03:40.87,00:03:42.19
Well, okay.

00:03:42.63,00:03:43.70
Well, there you go.

00:03:43.95,00:03:46.18
It's just, he got this new[br]home-theater dealy. . .

00:03:46.39,00:03:48.22
. . .and he wants us to check it out.

00:03:48.59,00:03:50.03
He's excited about it too.

00:03:50.27,00:03:53.18
He even recorded showtimes[br]on his answering machine.

00:03:53.87,00:03:55.62
-We're sorry, honey.[br]-Oh, it's okay.

00:03:55.87,00:03:59.18
Rach, it's not that[br]we don't want to. Really.

00:03:59.43,00:04:02.66
Are we talking models[br]in their underwear?

00:04:03.51,00:04:04.31
And heels.

00:04:08.23,00:04:11.19
Ross did ask us first,[br]and we set that night aside.

00:04:11.43,00:04:14.63
Come on. If he asked you first,[br]it's only fair.

00:04:17.75,00:04:20.39
Oh, boy, do I feel bad!

00:04:21.11,00:04:22.18
very bad.

00:04:22.43,00:04:24.15
Chandler, what are you doing?

00:04:25.43,00:04:26.79
Oh, my God!

00:04:27.75,00:04:28.98
You're smoking again?

00:04:29.23,00:04:31.79
Well, actually,[br]yesterday, I was smoking again.

00:04:32.03,00:04:33.26
Today I'm smoking, still.

00:04:34.31,00:04:37.83
Why would you start again[br]after chewing all that quitting gum?

00:04:38.03,00:04:40.63
This is just like[br]my parents' divorce. . .

00:04:40.83,00:04:43.03
. . .which is when[br]I first started smoking.

00:04:44.15,00:04:45.63
Weren't you 9?

00:04:51.07,00:04:54.78
I'm telling you something,[br]that first smoke after naptime. . . .

00:04:56.99,00:04:58.98
That's great.[br]With my luck, that's him.

00:04:59.23,00:05:00.55
Him? Ross?

00:05:00.75,00:05:04.27
No, "Hymn" 253:[br]"His Eyes Are on the Sparrow. "

00:05:06.19,00:05:10.39
When my parents got divorced, I started[br]using humor as a defense mechanism.

00:05:13.27,00:05:15.87
Hi. Do you guys have weekend plans?

00:05:16.07,00:05:20.99
Because my sister says we can spend[br]the weekend at her cabin, skiing.

00:05:22.07,00:05:25.43
I'm asking you first, right?[br]I'm playing by the rules.

00:05:25.67,00:05:26.79
Absolutely.

00:05:26.99,00:05:29.83
Chandler! You're smoking?[br]What are you doing?

00:05:30.07,00:05:32.22
Shut up![br]You're not my real mom!

00:05:38.47,00:05:42.18
Could you close that window?[br]My nipples could cut glass!

00:05:45.27,00:05:47.74
Really? Because mine[br]get me out of tickets.

00:05:50.35,00:05:55.19
Look, I just wanna say I really[br]appreciate you spending time with me.

00:05:55.39,00:05:59.35
It's been a hard time right now,[br]so I just want to say thanks.

00:05:59.55,00:06:02.59
Somebody else hug him.[br]I have to stay by the window.

00:06:06.07,00:06:09.62
How about this weekend, we have[br]a laser-disc marathon, okay?

00:06:09.87,00:06:12.78
And maybe a tournament[br]on my new: : :

00:06:13.87,00:06:16.26
. . .dart board! What do you think?

00:06:16.47,00:06:18.78
Two days of darts! It'll be great!

00:06:20.67,00:06:22.03
It'll be great for next weekend.

00:06:22.23,00:06:23.82
This weekend, guys.

00:06:24.03,00:06:26.02
It'll be great for next weekend.

00:06:26.27,00:06:28.79
I mean, "It'll be great. "

00:06:31.87,00:06:32.78
What's going on?

00:06:33.03,00:06:37.82
We're sort of invited to go skiing.[br]You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?

00:06:41.27,00:06:43.79
So, for the whole weekend?

00:06:44.27,00:06:47.55
We're really sorry,[br]but she did ask us first.

00:06:49.39,00:06:51.83
That's okay. If you[br]all have to go away. . .

00:06:52.03,00:06:54.79
. . .for the first weekend I'm[br]alone by myself. . .

00:06:54.99,00:06:56.74
. . .then I totally understand.

00:06:57.63,00:06:59.43
I can stay. I'm gonna stay.

00:06:59.67,00:07:02.98
The last time I went,[br]I was afraid to leave the chair lift.

00:07:03.19,00:07:04.78
I just went round and round.

00:07:05.99,00:07:09.11
We need you to drive us there[br]in your grandmother's cab.

00:07:09.31,00:07:13.83
-But you know what? I'll stay.[br]-No, I'll stay. He's my brother.

00:07:14.03,00:07:15.99
What, a "pity stay"?

00:07:16.87,00:07:18.99
We're gonna have fun!

00:07:19.23,00:07:21.22
We can make fudge.

00:07:23.39,00:07:24.62
Pity food?

00:07:25.67,00:07:28.39
You know what?[br]I don't need any of you to stay.

00:07:28.59,00:07:29.95
Nobody stays.

00:07:30.23,00:07:32.67
Well, then, I might as well[br]offer to stay.

00:07:40.87,00:07:43.10
Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?

00:07:43.35,00:07:44.50
You think he's still mad?

00:07:44.71,00:07:48.75
He's probably more mad since[br]you called him to borrow his goggles.

00:07:48.95,00:07:50.51
What? Mine aren't tinted.

00:07:55.07,00:07:55.98
What?

00:07:56.23,00:07:58.19
What does the sign say?

00:07:59.63,00:08:01.78
"Beam me up, Jesus. "

00:08:02.59,00:08:03.99
The "No Smoking" sign.

00:08:04.23,00:08:06.79
There's no smoking[br]in my grandmother's cab.

00:08:07.47,00:08:10.19
Well, then, I have to go[br]to the bathroom.

00:08:10.51,00:08:11.99
Oh, please!

00:08:12.19,00:08:14.99
No unscheduled stops.[br]You can go when we stop for gas.

00:08:15.19,00:08:19.63
There's a rest stop right up there.[br]Come on, I really have to go!

00:08:22.03,00:08:23.59
Oh, now I have to go!

00:08:31.43,00:08:32.63
Here we go.

00:08:32.83,00:08:34.39
-Brace yourself![br]-What?

00:08:43.67,00:08:45.55
-Aren't you gonna go?[br]-No, thanks.

00:08:45.75,00:08:48.35
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.

00:08:49.07,00:08:50.98
They never have any paper in there.

00:08:51.23,00:08:53.95
So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy. "

00:09:00.15,00:09:02.38
Well, if everybody's going. . . .

00:09:03.47,00:09:05.75
Don't close it![br]The keys are in there!

00:09:07.83,00:09:10.22
-What's going on?[br]-My lighter's in there!

00:09:16.99,00:09:19.87
Damn! The tailpipe's[br]not hot enough to light this.

00:09:21.59,00:09:24.19
I can open this.[br]Anybody got a coat hanger?

00:09:24.43,00:09:25.23
Oh, I do.

00:09:25.43,00:09:28.82
No, I took it out of my shirt[br]when I put it on this morning.

00:09:30.67,00:09:32.42
So if your parents hadn't divorced. . .

00:09:32.63,00:09:35.78
. . .you'd be able to answer a question[br]like a normal person?

00:09:37.47,00:09:40.83
Look, I just need a wire something[br]to jimmy it.

00:09:41.03,00:09:43.02
One of you give me[br]your bra underwire.

00:09:45.23,00:09:47.59
Come on![br]Who has the biggest boobs?

00:09:49.07,00:09:52.51
Whoever has the biggest boobs,[br]has the biggest bra and wire.

00:09:52.95,00:09:54.31
-No![br]-It's too expensive!

00:09:55.15,00:09:57.83
To get back in the car,[br]we need that wire.

00:09:58.07,00:09:59.22
Your call.

00:10:02.87,00:10:04.19
Monica's are the biggest.

00:10:06.47,00:10:10.59
These tiny little non-breasts?[br]Please! It's gotta be Rachel.

00:10:11.83,00:10:13.63
No, mine are deceptively small.

00:10:13.87,00:10:17.47
I mean, I actually sometimes[br]stuff my bra.

00:10:18.47,00:10:21.38
Well, then, your bra would[br]still be big.

00:10:21.59,00:10:23.95
No, I stuff outside the bra.

00:10:24.91,00:10:27.11
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?

00:10:27.35,00:10:29.58
Phoebe, Rachel,[br]take off Monica's bra.

00:10:30.71,00:10:32.38
All right, forget it, never mind.

00:10:32.63,00:10:34.43
-You can have mine.[br]-Thank you.

00:10:37.27,00:10:40.18
What are you doing?[br]There's a trash can right there.

00:10:40.83,00:10:44.79
I thought if I littered, that crying[br]lndian might come by and save us.

00:10:47.83,00:10:48.63
There.

00:10:49.47,00:10:52.43
Thank you, Phoebe.[br]That's very, very generous.

00:10:53.27,00:10:55.39
Now, let's decide[br]who has the nicest ass.

00:10:58.35,00:10:59.47
And there you go!

00:11:05.47,00:11:08.38
Well, at least let me smoke it[br]to the good part!

00:11:20.59,00:11:22.23
-What's going on?[br]-What?

00:11:22.47,00:11:24.78
Yeah, this has happened before.

00:11:25.07,00:11:28.78
-So you know how to fix it?[br]-Yep. Put more gas in.

00:11:37.23,00:11:39.19
Hi. What are you doing here?

00:11:39.43,00:11:41.63
I was wondering,[br]when you and I split up. . .

00:11:41.87,00:11:45.79
. . .did you get the tape that was[br]half the last episode of M.A. S.H...

00:11:45.99,00:11:48.11
. . .and half the hostages coming home?

00:11:49.47,00:11:52.99
But now it's Susan and me in Mexico[br]and the hostages coming home.

00:11:53.63,00:11:54.43
Where's Ben?

00:11:54.63,00:11:55.83
He's sleeping.

00:11:57.95,00:11:59.78
Is this a bad time?

00:12:00.03,00:12:02.71
Yeah, actually.[br]Susan's gonna be here any minute.

00:12:02.91,00:12:04.50
It's kind of an anniversary.

00:12:05.15,00:12:07.51
I thought you guys[br]got married in January.

00:12:07.71,00:12:09.35
A different kind of anniversary.

00:12:13.99,00:12:15.63
So anyway--

00:12:15.87,00:12:17.70
Candles, champagne. . . .

00:12:18.07,00:12:20.38
Yeah, anniversaries are great. . .

00:12:20.87,00:12:23.26
. . .because love lasts forever,[br]you know?

00:12:24.07,00:12:27.19
There's nothing like it[br]in this life. Money in the bank.

00:12:27.43,00:12:29.10
So Rachel and I broke up.

00:12:30.59,00:12:33.03
God, Ross, I am so sorry!

00:12:34.47,00:12:35.43
You know what?

00:12:35.67,00:12:37.63
I wanna talk about this so much. . .

00:12:37.83,00:12:40.03
. . .but when we can really get into it.

00:12:40.27,00:12:42.42
-You free for dinner tomorrow?[br]-I'd love that.

00:12:42.63,00:12:43.54
Me too.

00:12:43.75,00:12:47.22
I guess it all started[br]when Rachel got this new job.

00:12:49.63,00:12:51.43
Triple A can pick us up.

00:12:51.67,00:12:53.50
What town are we near?

00:12:53.75,00:12:54.55
Freemont.

00:12:54.75,00:12:56.07
Westmont.

00:12:56.55,00:12:57.35
Westberg?

00:12:57.55,00:12:59.38
Why are you answering?

00:13:00.55,00:13:02.19
Do you know[br]what route we're on?

00:13:02.43,00:13:05.31
We are definitely on Route 27.

00:13:05.51,00:13:08.39
We are at a rest stop on Route 27--

00:13:08.59,00:13:10.26
There is no Route 27.

00:13:10.47,00:13:12.91
-Either 93 or 76.[br]-I don't know.

00:13:13.11,00:13:15.55
I always slept in the back[br]when we drove here.

00:13:16.67,00:13:21.22
Can you just send someone up and down[br]76 and check every rest stop?

00:13:21.47,00:13:23.19
And also 93?

00:13:25.87,00:13:27.10
No, they don't do that.

00:13:30.63,00:13:32.38
Somebody will come and save us.

00:13:32.63,00:13:35.83
Who? Have you seen a car[br]in the last hour and a half?

00:13:36.07,00:13:39.03
We should call Ross.[br]Maybe he can get a car to get us.

00:13:39.27,00:13:41.42
I am not getting in a car with Ross!

00:13:41.67,00:13:43.39
We will just have to. . .

00:13:43.59,00:13:44.42
. . .Iive here!

00:13:45.83,00:13:47.31
-But it's so cold.[br]-No!

00:13:47.51,00:13:50.82
I won't get in a car with him.[br]Think of something else.

00:13:51.07,00:13:52.51
Joey and Chandler are back!

00:13:55.59,00:13:57.82
So the "going for help" went well?

00:13:58.27,00:14:01.98
Smokey Joe here got halfway[br]to the highway and collapsed.

00:14:02.19,00:14:04.39
I have the lung capacity[br]of a 2-year-old.

00:14:05.03,00:14:06.43
Then why are you smoking?

00:14:06.63,00:14:07.95
It's very unsettling.

00:14:11.35,00:14:13.79
Right? I mean,[br]it's pretty unbelievable.

00:14:14.03,00:14:17.47
They just took off,[br]without even looking back.

00:14:18.27,00:14:21.50
I don't need them.[br]I've got you guys now as friends.

00:14:21.75,00:14:22.79
You and Susan.

00:14:23.43,00:14:25.58
Susan will be so pleased.

00:14:27.63,00:14:29.15
Seven-one-seven?

00:14:29.35,00:14:30.79
Where's 71 7?

00:14:33.43,00:14:35.42
You have more of these[br]for Susan, right?

00:14:35.67,00:14:37.07
No, but that's okay.

00:14:37.27,00:14:39.79
I'll just put out pickles[br]or something.

00:14:43.83,00:14:45.63
-Ross, thank God![br]-Pheebs?

00:14:45.83,00:14:47.27
Why are you whispering?

00:14:47.79,00:14:49.62
I ate a bug.

00:14:50.75,00:14:53.39
Hey, Rach! The tampons here[br]are only a penny.

00:14:53.59,00:14:55.18
Let's stock up.

00:14:56.23,00:15:00.35
We're out of gas and don't know where[br]we are so we can't get a tow truck.

00:15:01.47,00:15:03.14
Now you want a favor?

00:15:03.35,00:15:04.15
Yes, please.

00:15:04.35,00:15:06.79
I'm sorry your[br]car broke down, Pheebs. . .

00:15:07.03,00:15:10.10
. . .but I'm too busy with some of[br]my real friends right now.

00:15:10.31,00:15:12.99
But please call to let me know[br]you got home safely.

00:15:13.23,00:15:14.98
Phoebe, hang on a second.

00:15:15.27,00:15:16.86
Take my car.[br]Get your friends.

00:15:17.07,00:15:18.63
No, I won't pick them up.

00:15:18.87,00:15:21.71
We both know you'll do it,[br]because you're not a jerk.

00:15:21.95,00:15:24.79
So you can sulk here for half an hour,[br]then go get them. . .

00:15:25.03,00:15:27.83
-. . .or save time and sulk in the car.[br]-Rachel doesn't--

00:15:28.07,00:15:30.14
I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark. . .

00:15:30.35,00:15:32.79
. . .and you're the innocent victim[br]in this.

00:15:33.03,00:15:35.71
But don't punish your friends[br]for what Rachel did.

00:15:37.99,00:15:39.19
Yeah, you're right.

00:15:39.79,00:15:42.39
Phoebe, hang on.[br]Ross wants to say something.

00:15:42.59,00:15:43.39
What?

00:15:43.67,00:15:45.19
You slept with someone else?

00:15:47.03,00:15:48.67
We were on a break!

00:15:50.07,00:15:51.06
We were--

00:15:52.19,00:15:55.18
Where are you? I'll find you.

00:15:55.43,00:15:56.83
You slept with another woman?

00:15:57.03,00:15:59.55
Oh, you're one to talk.

00:16:03.87,00:16:05.39
Okay, done!

00:16:07.67,00:16:08.55
What's "pleh"?

00:16:09.67,00:16:11.79
That's "help" spelled backwards. . .

00:16:11.99,00:16:14.98
. . .so that the helicopters can read it[br]from the air.

00:16:17.07,00:16:19.38
What's "dufus" spelled backwards?

00:16:21.99,00:16:22.90
Car! Car!

00:16:26.47,00:16:28.94
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!

00:16:30.75,00:16:32.55
What is he doing here?

00:16:32.75,00:16:34.58
He is saving your butt.

00:16:34.83,00:16:36.87
Unless I'm stepping on[br]some toes here. . .

00:16:37.07,00:16:38.82
. . .in which case[br]I could just mosey on.

00:16:39.07,00:16:41.43
I have plenty of people to help[br]on the interstate.

00:16:41.63,00:16:43.91
-Come on![br]-We need your help, please!

00:16:44.11,00:16:45.99
Fine! Fine!

00:16:49.79,00:16:53.18
Oh, no! Now it's[br]not gonna make any sense.

00:16:54.83,00:16:56.03
You guys. . .

00:16:56.55,00:16:59.39
. . .what do we do about Ross?[br]He drove all the way up here.

00:16:59.63,00:17:01.78
Just send him back,[br]then we'll go skiing?

00:17:02.03,00:17:04.79
This is horrible.[br]It's just horrible.

00:17:05.39,00:17:07.46
Should we ask Ross to come along?

00:17:07.67,00:17:10.63
But what about Rachel?[br]How are we gonna even ask her?

00:17:10.87,00:17:12.39
Ask me what?

00:17:15.03,00:17:17.75
If it might be okay if[br]Ross came skiing?

00:17:18.27,00:17:20.58
No, I wasn't gonna ask that.

00:17:22.59,00:17:25.50
You guys are unbelievable.[br]No, he cannot come!

00:17:25.75,00:17:27.79
-Excuse me?[br]-It's horrible!

00:17:28.35,00:17:33.03
Oh, please? Can't I come[br]to your special, magical cabin?

00:17:33.27,00:17:36.79
Why would you even want to come?[br]You're a horrible skier.

00:17:37.03,00:17:39.71
Hitting me where it hurts![br]My ski skills!

00:17:40.75,00:17:41.82
Here we go again.

00:17:42.03,00:17:43.59
I can't handle this, you guys.

00:17:43.79,00:17:45.91
I can handle it.[br]"Handle" is my middle name.

00:17:46.15,00:17:49.59
Actually, it's the middle part[br]of my first name.

00:17:51.15,00:17:53.22
All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.

00:17:53.43,00:17:54.39
Let's go.

00:17:55.23,00:17:56.03
You're welcome.

00:17:56.27,00:17:59.79
I'm sorry. Were you speaking to me,[br]or sleeping with someone else?

00:18:01.07,00:18:02.27
We were on a break!

00:18:02.47,00:18:05.91
Why don't you just put that[br]on your answering machine?

00:18:06.11,00:18:08.79
It's valid, and I'm not the only one[br]who thinks so.

00:18:08.99,00:18:10.14
Monica agrees with me.

00:18:10.87,00:18:11.86
What?

00:18:12.79,00:18:14.07
I don't know.

00:18:15.35,00:18:16.67
You said it last night.

00:18:17.03,00:18:20.18
What I said[br]was that I understood.

00:18:20.39,00:18:23.07
Joey is the one who agreed with you.

00:18:23.67,00:18:24.90
Really, Joey?

00:18:26.43,00:18:27.39
What?

00:18:28.47,00:18:31.43
You know what?[br]There is no right or wrong here.

00:18:31.63,00:18:34.02
I think it's very obvious[br]who's wrong here.

00:18:34.23,00:18:36.19
Obviously not to Joey.

00:18:38.79,00:18:39.78
What?

00:18:40.59,00:18:44.67
-Joey and Monica feel the way I do![br]-You and this innocent puppy act!

00:18:45.51,00:18:47.58
Hey, guess who I am?

00:18:57.47,00:18:59.78
Look what you're doing to Chandler!

00:19:03.07,00:19:06.78
Look. We know that this is[br]really, really hard for you guys.

00:19:07.75,00:19:09.66
You don't have to love each other.

00:19:09.87,00:19:13.39
You don't even have to like[br]each other much right now.

00:19:13.59,00:19:16.31
But please, find a way[br]to be around each other.

00:19:16.51,00:19:19.03
And not put us in the middle.

00:19:19.23,00:19:24.02
Otherwise, I mean, that's just it[br]for us hanging out together.

00:19:24.27,00:19:26.18
Is that what you want?

00:19:28.03,00:19:29.59
Can you be civil?

00:19:32.67,00:19:33.79
I can.

00:19:35.11,00:19:37.79
Good, let's get back in the car.[br]It's freezing. . .

00:19:38.03,00:19:39.75
. . .and my chest is unsupported.

00:19:40.75,00:19:41.82
Wait a second!

00:19:42.07,00:19:44.75
I mean, what are we doing?[br]Who's going with who?

00:19:48.63,00:19:51.23
Look, you guys should go.

00:19:52.27,00:19:54.58
You know,[br]you planned this all out. . .

00:19:56.23,00:19:58.62
. . .and I don't wanna ruin it.[br]So just go.

00:19:58.87,00:20:00.83
You drove all the way up here.

00:20:01.07,00:20:03.22
I've got to take[br]the car back anyway.

00:20:03.47,00:20:05.59
I'm spending all day[br]tomorrow with Ben.

00:20:05.79,00:20:09.79
It's fine, okay? Just go.[br]No guilt, I promise.

00:20:11.79,00:20:12.59
Thank you.

00:20:15.11,00:20:16.63
We'll call you when we get back.

00:20:17.27,00:20:20.34
Maybe we can, like,[br]go to a movie or something.

00:20:20.55,00:20:21.99
Or the rodeo!

00:20:23.87,00:20:24.99
That would be great.

00:20:26.91,00:20:29.95
I was being Shelley Winters[br]from The Poseidon Adventure.

00:20:32.11,00:20:32.91
I know.

00:20:41.15,00:20:42.22
Bye!

00:21:06.47,00:21:07.99
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

00:21:08.35,00:21:09.42
Were you sleeping?

00:21:10.67,00:21:12.07
Oh, great.

00:21:13.19,00:21:16.34
I had to get you a new battery.[br]I got the best I could.

00:21:16.55,00:21:18.30
You don't want to skimp there.

00:21:18.51,00:21:19.58
You're a genius.

00:21:19.83,00:21:21.23
It came to about $1 1 2.

00:21:21.47,00:21:23.75
But what the hell,[br]call it an even 1 1 0?

00:21:25.11,00:21:27.07
I'll pay you tomorrow. Bye!

00:21:27.27,00:21:29.63
So they all took off.

00:21:29.87,00:21:32.83
It was pretty hard[br]watching them go, you know?

00:21:33.07,00:21:34.59
Yeah, okay.[br]Bye.

00:21:38.47,00:21:40.62
So I'm gonna take off then.

00:00:03.10,00:00:05.25
-Here you go.[br]-Thank you.

00:00:07.10,00:00:08.17
"Say, Rachel...

00:00:08.42,00:00:11.34
...l was wondering if you'd[br]go to a movie with me sometime...

00:00:11.54,00:00:13.02
...as my lover. "

00:00:16.22,00:00:17.37
Too out there.

00:00:17.62,00:00:20.30
"Maybe you'd like to have[br]dinner with me sometime...

00:00:21.18,00:00:22.58
...as my lover. "

00:00:26.74,00:00:28.38
All right, let's go shopping.

00:00:28.66,00:00:31.18
Before we go, there's something[br]I need to say.

00:00:36.62,00:00:39.06
I've kind of had this crush on you.

00:00:40.14,00:00:42.86
Since you were with Ross,[br]I didn't do anything about it.

00:00:43.10,00:00:46.86
Now that you're not, I'd really[br]like to ask you out sometime.

00:00:47.50,00:00:49.46
So that's what I'm doing. . .

00:00:49.78,00:00:50.61
: : :now:

00:01:06.30,00:01:07.58
I dropped a cup.

00:01:09.34,00:01:11.46

00:02:02.18,00:02:06.50
You know, so you could be, like,[br]"Wash my car. " "Clean my room. "

00:02:06.70,00:02:10.33
It won't be able to do any of those[br]things, but it'll understand.

00:02:11.74,00:02:12.97
Oh, this was so great.

00:02:13.18,00:02:14.46
Yeah, it was.

00:02:16.14,00:02:17.21
All right, then.

00:02:18.78,00:02:20.06
Bye.

00:02:25.58,00:02:28.14
Hello, people who do not live here.

00:02:32.22,00:02:34.37
I gave you a key for emergencies.

00:02:34.62,00:02:36.62
We were out of Doritos.

00:02:38.14,00:02:40.74
Hey, how'd the date go[br]with Mr. Millionaire?

00:02:40.94,00:02:43.94
"Mr. Millionaire.[br]New, from Snooty Playthings.

00:02:44.78,00:02:46.58
Third wife sold separately. "

00:02:47.54,00:02:50.26
He's great. We have such[br]a good time together.

00:02:50.50,00:02:55.34
He's so funny and so sweet.[br]And I'm not attracted to him at all!

00:02:55.74,00:02:56.73
Still?

00:02:57.66,00:03:01.13
It's driving me crazy. In every[br]other way, he's the perfect guy.

00:03:01.34,00:03:05.18
He has everything.[br]Plus, he actually has everything.

00:03:05.82,00:03:08.78
Life-sized lmperial Storm Troopers[br]from Sharper lmage?

00:03:09.02,00:03:10.42
Two.

00:03:10.98,00:03:13.05
Can Joey and I put them on and fight?

00:03:15.42,00:03:19.46
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy![br]I am a big old baddy

00:03:20.22,00:03:23.74
Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy![br]I am a big old baddy

00:03:27.54,00:03:30.62
I guess he must've gotten the part[br]in that play.

00:03:30.82,00:03:32.74
Either that, or Gloria Estefan[br]was right.

00:03:32.98,00:03:35.34
Eventually, the rhythm[br]is going to get you.

00:03:41.02,00:03:42.98
-Joe, how's it going?[br]-Good.

00:03:50.30,00:03:51.86
So you're playing Adrianne?

00:03:52.10,00:03:54.49
Yes. Are you one of the[br]retarded cousins?

00:03:56.62,00:04:00.06
No. I'm playing your husband, victor.[br]I'm Joey Tribbiani.

00:04:00.30,00:04:02.53
Hi. Nice to meet you.[br]Kate Miller.

00:04:09.22,00:04:11.53
So the play's pretty great, huh?

00:04:11.78,00:04:14.14
Oh, yeah.[br]I love Jennifer Banberry's work.

00:04:14.38,00:04:18.34
She's so incisive when it comes[br]to deconstructing the middle class.

00:04:18.54,00:04:20.69
Oh, forget about it. She rocks!

00:04:26.10,00:04:28.14
Where do I know you from?

00:04:29.62,00:04:31.22
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

00:04:32.54,00:04:33.82
Days of our Lives?

00:04:34.30,00:04:36.98
voted most datable neurosurgeon[br]by Teen Beat?

00:04:38.30,00:04:39.82
No, that's not it.

00:04:40.82,00:04:42.54
So you're a soap actor.

00:04:42.74,00:04:45.86
This must be exciting for you,[br]being in a real play.

00:04:46.06,00:04:48.74
Hey, I've done plays before.[br]I'm a serious actor.

00:04:50.14,00:04:51.18
That infomercial!

00:04:53.38,00:04:55.18
For the milk-carton-spout thing!

00:04:55.42,00:04:57.89
You're the guy who doesn't[br]know how to pour milk!

00:04:59.42,00:05:03.50
I actually can pour milk. But I got[br]you believing that I couldn't.

00:05:03.70,00:05:05.26
Now, see, that's acting.

00:05:05.90,00:05:08.54
Right. At the end, you choked[br]on a cookie.

00:05:08.98,00:05:09.86
That was real.

00:05:12.10,00:05:15.18
-I cannot believe Mark asked you out.[br]-I know.

00:05:15.42,00:05:17.14
What are you gonna tell him?

00:05:17.34,00:05:21.18
I told him I would think about it,[br]but I'm gonna tell him no.

00:05:23.42,00:05:25.94
I think I'd say no[br]to anybody right now.

00:05:29.10,00:05:32.18
But it was so strange.[br]I mean, I'm standing there. . .

00:05:32.42,00:05:36.54
. . .with this charming, cute guy[br]who's asking me to go out with him. . .

00:05:36.74,00:05:38.54
. . .which I'm allowed to do. . .

00:05:38.78,00:05:42.57
. . .and I felt guilty, like I'd be[br]cheating on Ross or something.

00:05:43.18,00:05:46.18
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means. . .

00:05:46.38,00:05:50.14
. . .you're not over Ross yet[br]and you have issues with your father.

00:05:53.98,00:05:57.58
-I don't have issues with my father.[br]-So it's just the Ross thing.

00:05:59.82,00:06:01.74
I hate this woman! I hate her!

00:06:01.94,00:06:04.33
She told everyone[br]about that infomercial. . .

00:06:04.54,00:06:07.54
. . .and now they all keep asking me[br]to open their drinks!

00:06:07.78,00:06:11.86
And whenever I can't do it,[br]they're all, like, laughing at me!

00:06:17.02,00:06:18.50
So Rachel called.

00:06:19.78,00:06:21.10
Wants to see me.

00:06:22.54,00:06:24.02
Going over in a minute.

00:06:24.74,00:06:29.14
-What do you think she wants?[br]-Maybe the crazy fog has lifted. . .

00:06:29.38,00:06:32.30
. . .and she realizes that life[br]without me. . .

00:06:32.78,00:06:33.58
. . .sucks.

00:06:34.82,00:06:39.53
It's possible. You are very lovable.[br]I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

00:06:40.58,00:06:42.22
Just trying to be supportive.

00:06:43.34,00:06:45.10
Be supportive like a guy.

00:06:46.26,00:06:48.54
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.

00:06:56.74,00:06:58.18
You wanted to see me?

00:07:03.14,00:07:05.53
Here's a box of your stuff.

00:07:09.14,00:07:13.70
It's just hats and a shirt and CDS.[br]Just stuff that you've left here.

00:07:14.30,00:07:17.54
What are you doing? Are you trying[br]to hurt me or something?

00:07:23.42,00:07:27.13
It just seems that, you know,[br]it's time we move on.

00:07:27.38,00:07:28.78
I mean, don't you think?

00:07:32.22,00:07:33.66
-Yes, I do.[br]-Good.

00:07:34.38,00:07:35.86
I really do.

00:07:39.54,00:07:41.46
This was a gift.

00:07:41.66,00:07:44.54
You got that for free[br]from the museum gift shop.

00:07:45.02,00:07:46.54
It's still a gift.

00:07:46.78,00:07:49.17
I got it from the "gift" shop.

00:07:50.82,00:07:53.74
Okay! All right! Give me the mug![br]I'll keep the mug!

00:07:53.98,00:07:55.38
Don't do me any favors.

00:07:55.62,00:07:56.98
In fact. . .

00:07:57.70,00:08:00.26
. . .where's the rest of my stuff?[br]Like my. . . .

00:08:02.58,00:08:04.14
This book is mine!

00:08:06.82,00:08:10.86
And that T-shirt you sleep in?[br]I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.

00:08:12.62,00:08:16.94
You know how much I love that T-shirt.[br]You never even wear that T-shirt.

00:08:17.30,00:08:19.66
I'm just trying to help you "move on. "

00:08:20.62,00:08:23.06
Oh, you are a petty man.

00:08:23.30,00:08:25.34
You are a petty, petty. . .

00:08:25.54,00:08:26.94
-Petty. . .[br]-. . . petty, petty. . .

00:08:27.18,00:08:28.38
-. . .small. . . .[br]-. . .small. . . .

00:08:32.26,00:08:35.34
You are so just doing this[br]out of spite.

00:08:36.46,00:08:39.38
I'm gonna wear this all the time![br]I love this shirt!

00:08:40.02,00:08:44.89
You haven't worn it since you were 1 5![br]It doesn't even fit you anymore!

00:08:59.62,00:09:02.93
If you don't mind, I'm gonna[br]take the rest of my stuff. . .

00:09:03.42,00:09:05.02
. . .and "relax" . . .

00:09:06.30,00:09:08.26
. . .in my favorite shirt.

00:09:10.14,00:09:12.14
You have a pleasant evening.

00:09:21.54,00:09:23.34
So you're, like, a zillionaire.

00:09:25.06,00:09:27.26
And you're our age.[br]You're our age.

00:09:27.98,00:09:30.45
You know what?[br]You should buy a state. . .

00:09:30.70,00:09:32.82
. . .and then just name it[br]after yourself.

00:09:33.42,00:09:34.70
Like, "Pete Dakota"?

00:09:36.38,00:09:37.94
Or "Mississi-Pete. "

00:09:39.78,00:09:42.22
I got it: "Pete Chicago. "

00:09:44.14,00:09:45.98
That's not a state, Joe.

00:09:46.42,00:09:48.73
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

00:09:50.74,00:09:52.10
I gotta go.

00:09:52.70,00:09:54.14
I'll see you guys later.

00:09:54.34,00:09:55.86
You're our age.

00:09:58.22,00:09:59.86
So are we on for tomorrow?

00:10:00.10,00:10:01.33
Absolutely.

00:10:03.14,00:10:05.34
Now, get out of here, you!

00:10:11.38,00:10:14.34
Okay, I'm running out of places[br]I can touch him.

00:10:14.98,00:10:16.42
Is something wrong with me?

00:10:16.66,00:10:19.26
Why am I only attracted to guys[br]with no future?

00:10:19.50,00:10:22.02
Either they're too old,[br]or they're too young.

00:10:22.26,00:10:24.26
And there's Pete,[br]who's crazy about me. . .

00:10:24.50,00:10:27.74
. . .and he's absolutely perfect,[br]and there's zip going on!

00:10:27.94,00:10:30.06
Does it sound like[br]something's wrong with me?

00:10:30.30,00:10:31.42
Yeah, kind of.

00:10:34.54,00:10:37.34
Happy? ls that what I'm[br]supposed to be, vic?

00:10:37.58,00:10:38.78
Happy?

00:10:39.02,00:10:41.54
Why don't you tell me what[br]you're supposed to be?

00:10:41.74,00:10:43.94
Because I sure as hell can't[br]figure it out!

00:10:44.14,00:10:46.34
I talk to you, and nothing!

00:10:46.58,00:10:48.58
You look at me, and it's nothing!

00:10:52.10,00:10:53.25
Nothing.

00:10:55.82,00:10:56.81
Tasty.

00:10:58.46,00:11:02.42
I'm really starting to feel like[br]you guys have a history. It's nice.

00:11:02.66,00:11:04.58
I have a question about this scene.

00:11:05.70,00:11:09.22
I don't understand why Adrianne's[br]attracted to victor.

00:11:09.46,00:11:11.14
Peel the onion.

00:11:12.22,00:11:14.10
First of all, he's good-looking.

00:11:15.82,00:11:18.58
My character needs a bit more[br]of a reason than that.

00:11:18.82,00:11:21.98
Hey, how about this one?[br]It says so in the script!

00:11:24.82,00:11:27.54
I don't know why my character[br]likes you either.

00:11:27.78,00:11:30.54
I mean, it says in the script[br]that you're a bitch.

00:11:31.42,00:11:34.54
-It doesn't say that in the script.[br]-It does in mine.

00:11:37.34,00:11:39.98
I can blow-dry it, gel it.[br]It doesn't matter.

00:11:40.22,00:11:41.94
I still wind up with this little. . .

00:11:42.18,00:11:46.38
. . .cowlick-y thing on the middle part[br]of my head. It's so annoying.

00:11:46.58,00:11:48.70
-Does it bug you?[br]-You bug me.

00:12:01.50,00:12:04.30
Is there any chance[br]you didn't see that?

00:12:07.78,00:12:09.93
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?

00:12:10.18,00:12:12.94
You can't stare through[br]the peephole for three hours.

00:12:15.54,00:12:17.06
You're gonna get peep-eye.

00:12:18.14,00:12:20.94
I knew it. I knew it.[br]I always knew she liked him.

00:12:21.30,00:12:25.74
She'd say no, but here we are. We just[br]broke up, first thing she does!

00:12:25.94,00:12:27.38
You didn't "just break up. "

00:12:27.62,00:12:29.38
It's been, like, three weeks!

00:12:29.62,00:12:33.38
You slept with somebody three hours[br]after you thought you broke up.

00:12:33.62,00:12:35.82
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.

00:12:37.38,00:12:39.02
Here they come! Here they--

00:12:39.34,00:12:42.02
If she kisses him good night,[br]I'll kill myself.

00:12:42.26,00:12:43.70
I can't watch.

00:12:44.94,00:12:46.86
Come on.[br]Date over! Date over!

00:12:47.62,00:12:49.74
Here we go. She's going in.

00:12:50.46,00:12:51.53
She's going in.

00:12:51.78,00:12:53.54
Wait! He's going in!

00:12:54.82,00:12:55.94
He's going in!

00:12:56.38,00:13:00.14
The door's closed! I can't see[br]anything with the door closed!

00:13:00.42,00:13:03.94
And the inventor of the door[br]rests happily in his grave.

00:13:04.42,00:13:06.73
I have to do something.[br]I have to stop it!

00:13:06.98,00:13:08.78
-Stop what?[br]-I don't know.

00:13:09.02,00:13:11.49
But I have a feeling[br]my being there will do it.

00:13:11.70,00:13:13.98
I'll go over and I will[br]borrow something!

00:13:14.34,00:13:15.98
Juice! I need juice!

00:13:16.22,00:13:17.10
You can't!

00:13:18.22,00:13:20.37
-They must be stopped![br]-I am your friend. . .

00:13:20.62,00:13:22.46
. . .and I won't let you do this!

00:13:22.74,00:13:24.89
You are surprisingly strong!

00:13:25.78,00:13:29.14
-I need juice! People need juice![br]-Look, man. . . .

00:13:29.34,00:13:31.22
-People need juice![br]-Listen to me!

00:13:35.82,00:13:39.86
She's moving on. If it's not[br]this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.

00:13:40.10,00:13:42.94
And unless you're thinking about[br]subletting my peephole. . .

00:13:43.14,00:13:46.22
. . .you'll have to get used to the fact[br]that it's over!

00:13:46.46,00:13:49.06
Okay, man? It's over.

00:13:55.62,00:13:57.82
It's just I miss her so much.

00:13:59.22,00:14:00.29
I know.

00:14:03.02,00:14:05.17
Why do your coffee mugs have numbers?

00:14:05.42,00:14:07.94
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.

00:14:08.18,00:14:11.73
So if one of them's missing,[br]she can be like, "Where's number 27?"

00:14:20.50,00:14:21.38
You know what?

00:14:21.62,00:14:24.22
No, and I don't think[br]I'm gonna want to.

00:14:24.98,00:14:28.42
-I can't do this.[br]-That's what I didn't want to know.

00:14:28.82,00:14:32.58
Oh, I'm just doing this[br]for the wrong reasons, you know?

00:14:32.78,00:14:34.70
I'm doing it to get back at Ross.

00:14:34.90,00:14:37.37
I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.

00:14:40.34,00:14:41.94
Fair, shmair. You know?

00:14:42.14,00:14:45.18
You wanna get back at Ross,[br]I am here for you.

00:14:46.38,00:14:47.42
Really.

00:14:47.66,00:14:52.14
I say we get back at him right here[br]on this couch. Right here!

00:14:53.82,00:14:55.78
Oh, my God.

00:14:57.50,00:14:58.94
I'm sorry about this.

00:15:00.42,00:15:01.49
That's okay.

00:15:03.54,00:15:04.34
You sure?

00:15:07.38,00:15:10.38
I can just go home and get back[br]at him by myself.

00:15:13.98,00:15:16.86
--and should become the penicillin[br]of the 2 1st century.

00:15:17.10,00:15:20.73
And so today, this hospital[br]is about to take major steps. . .

00:15:20.98,00:15:23.29
. . .toward leading that revolution.

00:15:24.98,00:15:26.46
Can I ask you something?

00:15:30.42,00:15:31.25
Where are we?

00:15:32.22,00:15:35.34
Well, with all these doctors[br]and nurses. . .

00:15:35.58,00:15:37.46
. . .I'm gonna say, "Midget Rodeo. "

00:15:38.50,00:15:39.86
Just tell me the truth.

00:15:45.18,00:15:47.74
You know, I don't think[br]I told you this. . .

00:15:47.94,00:15:51.18
. . .but I just recently got out[br]of a serious relationship.

00:15:51.42,00:15:53.62
Oh, right.[br]Wasn't that a year ago?

00:15:55.62,00:15:57.14
So I did tell you.

00:15:57.90,00:15:59.78
That's not really the thing.

00:16:00.02,00:16:04.81
I'm just in a place in my life[br]where I need to focus on me.

00:16:05.34,00:16:07.38
-Do you know what I mean?[br]-Oh, I know.

00:16:09.54,00:16:13.78
-I so want to be attracted to you.[br]-But you're not. Okay. Good.

00:16:14.02,00:16:15.17
I'm sorry.

00:16:17.54,00:16:19.34
You know what? Don't be.

00:16:20.30,00:16:22.37
Don't be, because it's not so bad.

00:16:23.14,00:16:23.94
It's not?

00:16:24.14,00:16:26.58
Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

00:16:28.90,00:16:31.21
Or someone you find attractive.

00:16:32.22,00:16:34.18
I just think, you know. . .

00:16:34.42,00:16:37.89
. . .that you might end up[br]feeling differently.

00:16:41.22,00:16:43.98
I don't want this[br]to come out wrong. . .

00:16:44.18,00:16:47.97
. . .but you're awfully confident for a[br]guy I said I wasn't attracted to.

00:16:48.22,00:16:50.34
Stupidly charming, isn't it?

00:16:52.90,00:16:56.69
You wanna get something to eat?[br]This place is kind of depressing.

00:16:57.70,00:17:02.49
Now the man who made all of this[br]possible, Mr. Peter Becker.

00:17:03.06,00:17:04.10
One second.

00:17:11.54,00:17:16.06
I don't think this town is big enough[br]for the both of us to relax in.

00:17:19.18,00:17:20.33
Draw!

00:17:24.02,00:17:25.58
I wasn't doing anything.

00:17:32.54,00:17:34.18
What did she do now?

00:17:34.42,00:17:38.94
Just because she went to Yale, she[br]thinks she's the greatest actress. . .

00:17:39.14,00:17:41.29
. . .since sliced bread.

00:17:42.30,00:17:45.34
Ah, Sliced Bread.[br]A wonderful Lady Macbeth.

00:17:46.02,00:17:49.57
I hate her. I hate her[br]with her "Oh, I'm so talented" . . .

00:17:49.82,00:17:53.53
. . .and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"[br]and "Oh, I smell so good. "

00:17:54.50,00:17:56.73
I think somebody has a crush[br]on somebody.

00:17:56.98,00:18:00.86
Can we please try and stay focused[br]on my problem here?

00:18:01.38,00:18:04.30
I'm talking about you,[br]you big, big freak.

00:18:08.42,00:18:10.14
You're out of your mind!

00:18:10.38,00:18:12.98
You've done nothing but talk[br]about her for 48 hours.

00:18:13.18,00:18:17.74
If you were in school, you'd be pulling[br]her pigtails and pushing her down now.

00:18:17.94,00:18:20.17
Then how come I keep thinking[br]about her. . .

00:18:20.42,00:18:23.18
. . .in all these sexual scenarios[br]and stuff?

00:18:29.34,00:18:33.18
Happy? ls that what I'm[br]supposed to be, vic? Happy?

00:18:33.42,00:18:36.18
Why don't you tell me what[br]you're supposed to be, huh?

00:18:36.42,00:18:38.65
Because I sure as hell can't[br]figure it out.

00:18:38.90,00:18:40.90
I talk to you, and it's nothing.

00:18:41.42,00:18:43.65
You look at me, and nothing.

00:18:56.50,00:18:57.65
Nothing.

00:18:59.70,00:19:03.09
You guys make me fly!

00:19:05.62,00:19:06.90
High!

00:19:08.02,00:19:10.74
Okay, we're gonna pick it up[br]here, tomorrow.

00:19:12.90,00:19:15.18
-Well, that was. . . .[br]-Better?

00:19:16.22,00:19:18.45
Yeah, it was definitely. . .

00:19:18.70,00:19:20.18
. . .an improvement.

00:19:21.62,00:19:23.46
-Good night.[br]-Kate.

00:19:25.54,00:19:26.77
You forgot your shoes.

00:19:29.22,00:19:31.69
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?

00:19:36.42,00:19:37.70
Hey, listen. . .

00:19:38.82,00:19:40.94
. . .you feel like getting[br]a cup of coffee?

00:19:42.42,00:19:43.33
Kate. . .

00:19:43.54,00:19:44.45
. . .you ready to go?

00:19:47.10,00:19:49.38
very nice. very nice.

00:19:54.38,00:19:56.18
-See you tomorrow?[br]-Yeah. Sure.

00:19:56.42,00:19:57.74
-Right.[br]-Good night.

00:20:10.50,00:20:12.30
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

00:20:12.90,00:20:14.66
Like Goldman, Silverman?

00:20:15.54,00:20:17.74
Because it's not his last name.

00:20:18.22,00:20:19.02
It isn't?

00:20:19.26,00:20:20.94
It's not, like. . .

00:20:21.14,00:20:22.74
. . .Phil Spiderman.

00:20:25.62,00:20:26.74
He's a Spider-. . .

00:20:26.98,00:20:28.54
: : :man:

00:20:29.58,00:20:32.46
You know, like, Goldman[br]is a last name.

00:20:32.70,00:20:35.09
But there's no Gold Man.

00:20:37.62,00:20:39.22
There should be a Gold Man!

00:20:43.54,00:20:44.94
-How was work?[br]-Oh, great.

00:20:45.18,00:20:47.94
Although I did sit down[br]where there wasn't a chair.

00:20:48.82,00:20:51.13
By the way, Ross dropped by[br]a box of your stuff.

00:20:51.38,00:20:54.30
Oh. Well, I guess I had[br]that one coming.

00:20:55.02,00:20:58.22
I'm just gonna throw it out.[br]It's probably just shampoo and--

00:21:00.02,00:21:01.22
Something wrong?

00:21:10.38,00:21:11.82
No. Nothing.

00:21:18.70,00:21:22.14
So what kind of powers[br]would "Gold Man" have?

00:21:23.30,00:21:26.34
Okay. Well, he would turn things[br]to gold.

00:21:26.94,00:21:30.90
-And things that are already gold?[br]-His work is done.

00:21:32.50,00:21:33.65
Let's play my game.

00:21:35.10,00:21:38.57
All right, you yellow-bellied,[br]lily-livered--

00:21:38.82,00:21:39.78
Draw!

00:21:43.38,00:21:44.21
Yeah, it's fun.

00:00:03.98,00:00:06.02
You're telling me[br]this actress person. . .

00:00:06.26,00:00:10.17
. . .is the only woman you ever wanted[br]who didn't want you back?

00:00:10.94,00:00:12.17
Oh, my God.

00:00:12.86,00:00:14.66
Is this what it's like to be you?

00:00:16.34,00:00:19.14
-You're crazy about her, huh?[br]-You have no idea.

00:00:19.38,00:00:23.17
When we're on stage, I get to[br]kiss her and touch her.

00:00:23.42,00:00:24.93
She goes home with the director. . .

00:00:25.14,00:00:26.97
. . .and it's like somebody's[br]ripping out my heart.

00:00:27.70,00:00:30.69
Oh, it's so great to see you[br]feeling like this.

00:00:35.30,00:00:37.02
Dad called this morning.

00:00:38.06,00:00:40.29
Aunt Sylvia passed away.

00:00:46.82,00:00:49.29
We were all[br]pretty shaken up about it.

00:00:49.74,00:00:50.81
Am I missing something?

00:00:51.06,00:00:53.78
I thought death was supposed[br]to be sad, in a way.

00:00:54.74,00:00:56.81
Well, Aunt Sylvia was. . .

00:00:57.06,00:00:58.41
. . .not a nice person.

00:00:58.66,00:01:02.29
She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.

00:01:03.34,00:01:04.57
And I'm sorry she died.

00:01:06.22,00:01:07.33
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

00:01:07.58,00:01:10.62
-You get the dollhouse.[br]-I get the dollhouse!

00:01:12.42,00:01:15.09
A house for dolls![br]That is so cool.

00:01:16.26,00:01:18.53
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.

00:01:19.78,00:01:21.69
You had a barrel for a dollhouse?

00:01:22.50,00:01:24.09
No, just a barrel.

00:01:25.38,00:01:27.29
You know what? You can play[br]with my dollhouse.

00:01:27.54,00:01:28.34
Really?

00:01:28.58,00:01:29.81
Any time you want.

00:01:30.06,00:01:32.89
When I was young I wanted[br]to play with this dollhouse.

00:01:33.14,00:01:36.29
But no! It was to be looked at,[br]never played with.

00:01:36.54,00:01:38.85
My grandmother said[br]the same thing to me.

00:01:41.30,00:01:43.37
The One With the Doll House

00:01:44.66,00:01:45.65
Subtitles and Rip by[br].:staz:. (staz@post.cz)

00:02:31.94,00:02:34.58
Thanks for lunch.[br]You didn't have to walk me here.

00:02:35.46,00:02:37.50
That's okay. No problem.

00:02:40.26,00:02:43.54
You realize we don't keep[br]the women's lingerie here.

00:02:46.06,00:02:47.89
Yes, I realize that.

00:02:48.66,00:02:50.89
-Summer catalog.[br]-That's the stuff.

00:02:52.14,00:02:54.70
Rachel, I need the versace invoice.

00:02:55.54,00:02:57.29
You don't work for me.

00:02:57.54,00:03:00.42
Joanna, this is my friend[br]Chandler Bing. Joanna.

00:03:00.66,00:03:02.14
Bing? That's a great name.

00:03:02.38,00:03:04.94
It's Gaelic for,[br]"Thy turkey's done. "

00:03:08.30,00:03:10.53
-I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you.[br]-You too.

00:03:14.22,00:03:16.10
So what's wrong with him?

00:03:16.30,00:03:20.69
Nothing. He's just goofy like that.[br]I actually hardly notice it anymore.

00:03:22.66,00:03:26.05
I mean, is he married[br]or involved with anyone?

00:03:27.50,00:03:30.17
He's not married or involved[br]with anyone.

00:03:33.46,00:03:35.10
Actually, you know what?[br]Forget it.

00:03:36.30,00:03:38.61
-I'll ask him for you, if you want.[br]-Would you?

00:03:38.86,00:03:42.41
Or is it too sad and desperate,[br]like something Sophie would do?

00:03:42.66,00:03:44.85
-I am here.[br]-I know that.

00:03:47.78,00:03:49.26
Look at it!

00:03:50.98,00:03:53.13
Wallpaper's a little faded.[br]That's okay.

00:03:53.38,00:03:54.70
Carpet's a little loose.

00:03:54.90,00:03:56.30
Hardwood floors?!

00:04:02.58,00:04:05.89
-It's so beautiful![br]-I know!

00:04:06.82,00:04:09.13
So I'm here, ready to play!

00:04:09.58,00:04:13.81
I brought a bunch of stuff[br]for the house, so check it out.

00:04:17.38,00:04:18.33
What's this?

00:04:18.58,00:04:20.81
That's a dog.[br]Every house should have a dog.

00:04:21.38,00:04:23.13
Not one that can pee on the roof.

00:04:25.58,00:04:30.05
Maybe it's so big because the house[br]was built on radioactive waste.

00:04:32.22,00:04:35.29
And is this in case the house sneezes?

00:04:38.14,00:04:40.53
No, that's the ghost for the attic.

00:04:41.62,00:04:45.09
-I don't want a ghost.[br]-Well, nobody wants a ghost.

00:04:46.62,00:04:47.94
But you've got one. . .

00:04:48.18,00:04:52.09
. . .because the house is sitting on[br]an ancient lndian burial ground.

00:04:53.94,00:04:56.98
Wait a minute. The house[br]was built on radioactive waste. . .

00:04:57.22,00:05:00.37
. . .and an ancient[br]lndian burial ground?

00:05:00.62,00:05:01.89
That would never happen.

00:05:03.50,00:05:06.70
Obviously you don't know much[br]about the U.S. government.

00:05:10.74,00:05:13.57
-I need to talk to you.[br]-Sure. What's up?

00:05:14.30,00:05:16.10
Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.

00:05:17.62,00:05:18.94
I know.

00:05:20.66,00:05:23.49
Well, if something comes up. . . .

00:05:26.62,00:05:29.74
I'm glad you guys are past[br]that little awkward phase.

00:05:31.78,00:05:34.37
My boss. Joanna. When you left. . .

00:05:34.62,00:05:37.09
. . .she started asking questions[br]about you. . . .

00:05:37.30,00:05:38.86
Liked what she saw?

00:05:41.02,00:05:43.09
Dug my action, did she?

00:05:43.30,00:05:46.21
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!

00:05:50.10,00:05:51.29
That was. . .

00:05:51.50,00:05:53.38
. . .surreal.

00:05:53.62,00:05:55.61
What do you think?[br]Are you interested?

00:05:56.50,00:06:00.09
She seemed cool. Attractive.[br]I'll do it.

00:06:00.30,00:06:03.69
Thank you, Chandler.[br]This is great. She's gonna love me.

00:06:03.90,00:06:07.49
Dinosaur attack![br]Quick, everybody into the house!

00:06:09.26,00:06:12.70
All right, Phoebe, you know what?[br]That's it. That's it.

00:06:12.94,00:06:15.98
No dinosaurs, no ghosts,[br]no giant dogs, okay?

00:06:16.22,00:06:19.89
They're not the right size, they're[br]not victorian and they don't go.

00:06:22.58,00:06:23.85
Fine.

00:06:24.86,00:06:28.90
Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome[br]in the house of no imagination.

00:06:29.10,00:06:33.49
While we're on the subject,[br]I have to say that dinosaurs. . .

00:06:33.70,00:06:36.50
. . .they don't go, "ruff! "

00:06:37.98,00:06:39.62
The little ones do.

00:06:47.42,00:06:49.30
-Hey, Kate.[br]-Morning.

00:06:49.66,00:06:51.81
I went to that restaurant[br]you talked about--

00:06:52.06,00:06:53.29
Hey, lovely.

00:06:53.50,00:06:55.62
Come, talk to me for a minute.

00:06:56.38,00:06:58.45
I ate the food. It was good.[br]I had the fish.

00:07:02.30,00:07:03.89
I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.

00:07:05.02,00:07:05.93
Joey Tribbiani.

00:07:06.50,00:07:07.30
I know.

00:07:07.54,00:07:09.21
I'm a big fan of yours.

00:07:09.46,00:07:10.41
What?

00:07:12.22,00:07:15.69
I used to schedule my classes[br]so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray. . .

00:07:15.90,00:07:17.46
. . .on Days of our Lives.

00:07:17.66,00:07:20.33
-Get out of here. Really?[br]-Absolutely.

00:07:20.74,00:07:23.54
But then they dropped you[br]down that elevator shaft.

00:07:23.78,00:07:25.37
They gave me the shaft, all right.

00:07:27.54,00:07:29.05
You're so funny.

00:07:29.54,00:07:31.10
What are you doing after rehearsal?

00:07:31.34,00:07:33.17
You want to get a drink?

00:07:40.02,00:07:41.50
Sure. A drink sounds great.

00:07:41.74,00:07:44.65
-Cool. I'll see you then.[br]-All right.

00:07:48.18,00:07:52.25
All right. It's time to act,[br]my talking props.

00:07:58.50,00:08:00.65
Look everybody![br]Look at my new dollhouse!

00:08:06.54,00:08:07.61
Look, look!

00:08:11.02,00:08:12.29
Hey, what's this?

00:08:12.50,00:08:15.25
It's a slide instead of stairs.[br]Look.

00:08:17.70,00:08:18.97
very interesting, Phoebe.

00:08:21.02,00:08:21.82
What's this?

00:08:22.06,00:08:25.50
The licorice room.[br]You can eat all the furniture.

00:08:27.06,00:08:30.65
And when guests come over, they can[br]stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.

00:08:32.22,00:08:34.41
This is the coolest house ever!

00:08:36.14,00:08:38.41
Does anyone want to join me[br]in the Aroma Room?

00:08:38.66,00:08:40.25
-All right.[br]-I would.

00:08:40.98,00:08:42.41
Hey, guys? Guys!

00:08:42.66,00:08:44.81
Did you see my new china cabinet?

00:08:48.18,00:08:49.69
Watch. Watch.

00:08:50.82,00:08:52.54
And? And?

00:08:56.70,00:08:59.29
Hey, my father's house does that.

00:09:01.74,00:09:03.14
How did it go?[br]Tell me everything!

00:09:03.38,00:09:04.57
The movie was great. . .

00:09:04.82,00:09:09.29
. . .dinner was great, and there's nothing[br]like a cool, crisp New York evening.

00:09:09.50,00:09:14.10
Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that[br]because Joanna's such a dull dud!

00:09:15.02,00:09:17.17
Chandler is fantastic!

00:09:18.02,00:09:20.29
-What?[br]-You know how people just click?

00:09:20.50,00:09:24.57
He came by to pick me up, I opened[br]the door and it was just like, "click! "

00:09:24.82,00:09:26.17
Did he tell you?

00:09:26.42,00:09:28.98
Doesn't he have a good heart?

00:09:29.22,00:09:32.89
And he's so sweet. He said he'd[br]call, so put him straight through.

00:09:33.18,00:09:36.06
-Isn't this great?[br]-Don't spoil it.

00:09:37.86,00:09:40.37
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?

00:09:40.62,00:09:41.89
What do you say?

00:09:45.02,00:09:47.41
It's you.[br]Just one sec.

00:09:49.06,00:09:50.78
I'm going to take this call.

00:09:51.98,00:09:55.02
When I continue,[br]I hope there will appear on-stage. . .

00:09:55.26,00:09:59.57
. . .this magical thing[br]that in the theater we call. . .

00:09:59.82,00:10:02.62
. . .committing to the moment!

00:10:06.70,00:10:08.89
The guy's like a cartoon.

00:10:09.70,00:10:11.50
What do you see in him, anyway?

00:10:11.70,00:10:13.13
He happens to be brilliant.

00:10:13.34,00:10:16.30
Which is more than I can say[br]for that sweater you're dating.

00:10:17.94,00:10:20.09
I'm not interested in her sweater.

00:10:20.34,00:10:22.41
It's what's underneath her sweater[br]that counts.

00:10:25.50,00:10:27.33
And besides. . .

00:10:27.58,00:10:29.25
. . .since when do you care[br]who I'm with?

00:10:29.54,00:10:32.26
I don't care.[br]Why, do you want me to care?

00:10:32.98,00:10:35.70
Do you want me to want you to care?

00:10:36.14,00:10:37.49
Do you?

00:10:38.02,00:10:38.97
What?

00:10:39.54,00:10:44.09
Okay. I'm afraid to say this,[br]but let's pick up where we left off.

00:10:50.54,00:10:54.37
Come on, baby, don't go. Please?[br]What do you say?

00:10:54.62,00:10:56.89
I've got no reason to stay.

00:10:59.10,00:11:00.61
Stop!

00:11:00.86,00:11:04.30
Stop it! You must stop!

00:11:06.06,00:11:08.62
You are bad actors!

00:11:08.98,00:11:11.29
This is a terrible play!

00:11:11.54,00:11:13.69
I'll see you in the morning.

00:11:16.22,00:11:19.29
I can't believe we go on[br]in a week.

00:11:19.66,00:11:21.89
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

00:11:22.74,00:11:25.49
Since we're getting off early,[br]do you want to go paint mugs?

00:11:28.42,00:11:29.49
What?

00:11:30.02,00:11:32.37
At the place I told you about[br]last night?

00:11:33.90,00:11:36.49
Yeah, with the mug-painting.

00:11:36.70,00:11:38.89
I was so listening to that.

00:11:40.02,00:11:42.85
But you know what?[br]I need to work on my stuff tonight.

00:11:44.82,00:11:46.49
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:11:58.42,00:11:59.90
Are you okay?

00:12:00.10,00:12:01.50
I guess.

00:12:03.18,00:12:05.49
What are we gonna do about the scene?

00:12:05.74,00:12:06.85
I don't know.

00:12:10.90,00:12:13.09
Maybe if it had more heat.

00:12:13.86,00:12:15.29
Well, how do you mean?

00:12:15.58,00:12:18.30
Adrianne's looking for a reason[br]to stay, right?

00:12:19.94,00:12:22.37
victor can't just kiss her.[br]He's gotta. . .

00:12:22.62,00:12:24.81
. . .he's gotta give her a reason.

00:12:25.74,00:12:27.70
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.

00:12:33.46,00:12:35.02
Or maybe. . .

00:12:35.26,00:12:39.01
. . .maybe he could grab her[br]and lift her up.

00:12:39.54,00:12:42.66
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs[br]around his waist.

00:12:43.46,00:12:46.90
Then she could rip off his shirt and[br]kiss his chest and stomach.

00:12:47.14,00:12:51.10
Then he could use his teeth[br]to undo her dress and. . .

00:12:51.30,00:12:52.18
. . .and bite her!

00:12:53.06,00:12:56.37
Then right when the scene ends,[br]he could take her. . .

00:12:56.62,00:12:59.29
. . .with this raw, animal. . . .

00:13:03.94,00:13:05.61
Something like that?

00:13:05.98,00:13:08.37
That's pretty much[br]what I had in mind.

00:13:29.90,00:13:32.70
It's a little early to be drinking.

00:13:34.18,00:13:37.57
Things finally happened with Kate.

00:13:37.82,00:13:39.57
You're kidding? That's great.

00:13:39.82,00:13:41.09
It was so amazing.

00:13:41.34,00:13:43.49
After the lovemaking. . .

00:13:43.74,00:13:44.62
Oh, my.

00:13:46.46,00:13:49.50
. . .I just watched her sleep for hours.

00:13:49.70,00:13:51.10
Just breathing in. . .

00:13:51.34,00:13:53.09
. . .and breathing out.

00:13:53.74,00:13:55.30
I knew she was dreaming because. . .

00:13:55.50,00:13:57.73
. . .her eyes kept going like this.

00:14:03.74,00:14:05.78
I'm telling you,[br]she's got it all wrong.

00:14:06.02,00:14:09.38
All I said was, "This was fun.[br]Let's do it again sometime.

00:14:09.62,00:14:10.77
I'll give you a call. "

00:14:12.54,00:14:15.34
I wonder why she thinks you're going[br]to call her?

00:14:16.10,00:14:17.90
It's what you say at the end[br]of a date.

00:14:18.10,00:14:20.77
You can't just say,[br]"Nice to meet you. Good night?"

00:14:21.30,00:14:22.53
To her face?

00:14:24.50,00:14:26.09
I'm standing there. . .

00:14:26.34,00:14:28.53
. . .she's waiting for me to say[br]I'll call her. . .

00:14:28.78,00:14:30.93
. . .and it comes out.[br]I can't help it.

00:14:31.18,00:14:32.17
It's a compulsion.

00:14:33.82,00:14:38.37
When a guy says he'll call,[br]it doesn't mean he's going to call.

00:14:38.74,00:14:40.62
This never happened to you?

00:14:40.86,00:14:42.69
Well, they always called.

00:14:43.86,00:14:45.09
Bite me.

00:14:51.30,00:14:53.42
-Did he call?[br]-No, sorry.

00:14:53.66,00:14:56.73
Why? He said he'd call.[br]Why hasn't he called?

00:14:56.98,00:15:00.86
Maybe he's intimidated by smart,[br]strong, successful women.

00:15:01.30,00:15:03.89
Sophie, will you please[br]climb out of my butt.

00:15:05.74,00:15:07.97
Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?

00:15:09.86,00:15:13.30
Maybe he feels awkward because[br]you're my boss.

00:15:13.50,00:15:16.38
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?

00:15:16.62,00:15:19.05
You didn't tell him[br]not to call me, did you?

00:15:19.70,00:15:22.13
If you're uncomfortable with[br]your friend dating me. . .

00:15:22.38,00:15:24.77
. . .there are always ways to fix that.

00:15:28.06,00:15:30.02
Call her. Call her now!

00:15:31.38,00:15:33.89
Multiple so many paper cuts.

00:15:35.02,00:15:38.90
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?[br]Why, why? I don't understand! "

00:15:39.10,00:15:42.33
I'm telling you, she's flipped out![br]She's gone crazy!

00:15:43.30,00:15:45.29
Well, give me the phone then.

00:15:45.78,00:15:48.42
She thinks it's my fault[br]you haven't called her.

00:15:48.66,00:15:49.89
You have to call her.

00:15:50.14,00:15:52.13
You can't call somebody[br]after this long to say:

00:15:52.38,00:15:55.50
"In case you didn't notice,[br]I don't like you. "

00:15:55.78,00:15:57.61
Then you'll have to[br]take her out again.

00:15:58.54,00:16:00.50
She's really dull,[br]and she gets this. . .

00:16:00.74,00:16:04.70
. . .gross mascara-goop thing[br]in the corner of her eye!

00:16:06.06,00:16:07.09
I don't care!

00:16:07.34,00:16:09.17
You'll take her out again[br]and end it. . .

00:16:09.42,00:16:11.69
. . .in a way she knows it's ended.

00:16:11.94,00:16:15.57
I don't care how hard it is.[br]Don't tell her you'll call her again!

00:16:15.98,00:16:16.78
All right, fine!

00:16:17.02,00:16:20.09
But just lunch.[br]From now on, I get my own dates.

00:16:20.34,00:16:22.38
I don't want you setting me up again!

00:16:22.62,00:16:23.53
That's fine!

00:16:24.94,00:16:27.50
-That's just a lot of big talk.[br]-I know.

00:16:31.14,00:16:33.10
I'm in the shower!

00:16:45.50,00:16:47.01
Fire! There's a fire! Fire!

00:17:20.98,00:17:24.69
I talked to Lauren.[br]I told her how things were with us.

00:17:24.94,00:17:26.53
Did you talk to Marshall?

00:17:27.66,00:17:28.65
About what?

00:17:29.94,00:17:32.17
About what happened with us.

00:17:34.54,00:17:38.09
No, there's really no reason[br]why he should find out.

00:17:38.34,00:17:40.90
So let's not make a big deal[br]out of it, okay?

00:17:42.78,00:17:44.50
What are you talking about?

00:17:44.82,00:17:46.89
It was a big deal.

00:17:48.26,00:17:51.09
You can't tell me last night[br]didn't mean something to you.

00:17:51.30,00:17:54.50
I was there.[br]You're not that good an actress.

00:17:57.46,00:17:59.61
I was just caught up in the moment.

00:17:59.86,00:18:01.50
That's all it was.

00:18:02.54,00:18:05.29
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but. . .

00:18:05.50,00:18:09.29
. . .haven't you slept with a woman[br]and it meant more to her than to you?

00:18:17.26,00:18:18.37
Hi, pig!

00:18:22.82,00:18:24.94
Sorry I scared you in there.

00:18:25.18,00:18:26.69
It's okay.

00:18:27.58,00:18:28.57
By the way. . .

00:18:28.82,00:18:31.81
. . .I was just checking[br]the shower massager.

00:18:36.10,00:18:37.90
I tried to reach you at work.

00:18:38.14,00:18:40.41
There's been a fire.

00:18:40.66,00:18:43.09
What?[br]Oh, my God!

00:18:44.90,00:18:46.41
What happened?

00:18:46.66,00:18:49.30
We believe it originated here. . .

00:18:50.42,00:18:52.33
. . .in the Aroma Room.

00:18:53.02,00:18:55.29
Did everyone get out okay?

00:18:55.50,00:18:58.62
The giraffe's okay,[br]and so is the pirate.

00:18:58.86,00:19:00.29
-What's this?[br]-No, don't look!

00:19:00.50,00:19:02.49
You don't want to see[br]what's under there!

00:19:05.38,00:19:07.26
The foster puppets!

00:19:11.50,00:19:15.97
It's not a big deal. It's right[br]here, and it's all the time.

00:19:18.94,00:19:20.93
Thanks again for lunch.

00:19:23.70,00:19:27.14
-This was pleasant.[br]-It was, wasn't it?

00:19:28.18,00:19:31.22
-The food there was great.[br]-Wasn't it?

00:19:33.34,00:19:35.49
So take care.

00:19:35.70,00:19:37.13
You too.

00:19:38.26,00:19:40.93
I'll give you a call.[br]We should do it again!

00:19:41.18,00:19:43.49
Great. I'm looking forward to it.

00:19:43.74,00:19:46.21
-Any messages?[br]-Sophie's desk.

00:19:50.30,00:19:51.89
Are you gonna call her?

00:19:53.78,00:19:57.33
I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak[br]and pathetic and sorry.

00:19:57.58,00:19:59.93
You are gonna tell her.[br]You'll tell her now.

00:20:00.18,00:20:01.85
I'm not gonna call you.

00:20:04.38,00:20:05.18
What?

00:20:06.54,00:20:08.37
I'm sorry.

00:20:08.62,00:20:12.17
I'm sorry I said I was going to[br]when I'm not.

00:20:13.74,00:20:15.09
This has nothing to do with you.

00:20:15.30,00:20:17.57
And this isn't Rachel's fault.[br]It's me.

00:20:17.82,00:20:20.73
I have serious problems[br]when it comes to women.

00:20:20.98,00:20:24.94
I have issues with commitment,[br]intimacy. . .

00:20:26.50,00:20:27.93
: : :mascara goop:

00:20:30.90,00:20:33.33
I'm really sorry. It's just that. . .

00:20:33.58,00:20:35.17
. . .this isn't going to work out.

00:20:38.86,00:20:41.33
This isn't how I was hoping[br]this would end. . .

00:20:41.58,00:20:44.73
. . .but I guess I have to appreciate[br]your honesty.

00:20:52.62,00:20:55.37
I'll give you a call.[br]We should do it again sometime!

00:21:01.42,00:21:04.01
Anyway, Beth,[br]what I'm saying is. . .

00:21:04.26,00:21:08.94
. . .I should have considered your[br]feelings before I went home with you.

00:21:10.66,00:21:13.62
I've recently learned what it's like[br]to be on your side. . .

00:21:13.86,00:21:15.50
. . .and I'm sorry.

00:21:17.06,00:21:19.13
Do you think you can forgive me?

00:21:20.18,00:21:22.01
Great. Thanks.

00:21:31.86,00:21:33.50
Hello, Jennifer?

00:21:33.74,00:21:36.30
Hi, Mrs. Laurio.[br]Is Jennifer there?

00:21:36.54,00:21:38.77
She's not home, huh?

00:21:40.30,00:21:43.02
Actually I kind of need[br]to talk to you too.

Whose idea was it to put[br]everybody in the diner on skates?

00:00:06.46,00:00:09.45
Some idiot customer put a suggestion[br]in the suggestion box.

00:00:09.66,00:00:12.49
-Oh, my God! They took my idea![br]-That was you?

00:00:13.50,00:00:14.85
Okay, there you go.

00:00:15.46,00:00:17.21
Rachel, I made you cocoa.

00:00:17.42,00:00:18.90
Oh, that's so. . . .

00:00:20.54,00:00:22.89
Oh, my God! Are you guys okay?

00:00:26.18,00:00:27.45

You know, with that goatee,[br]you kind of look like Satan.

00:01:25.14,00:01:28.21
So that's why the priest[br]threw holy water on me.

00:01:30.46,00:01:31.86
You have to cheer up.

00:01:32.38,00:01:34.49
You should come out with Ross and me.

00:01:34.70,00:01:38.29
Anything is better than sitting[br]here crying all day about Kate.

00:01:38.54,00:01:43.21
I was crying because[br]nobody believed Quincy's theory.

00:01:45.02,00:01:46.34
I'm gonna be on Tv!

00:01:46.58,00:01:47.81
No way!

00:01:48.06,00:01:51.53
They're putting together a panel[br]to talk about the fossils in Peru.

00:01:51.74,00:01:53.25
The Discovery Channel's filming it!

00:01:53.46,00:01:57.05
Oh, my God![br]Who's gonna watch that?

00:01:58.46,00:02:00.05
Thanks. You ready to go?

00:02:00.50,00:02:02.22
I saw a girl with that vest.

00:02:02.46,00:02:03.45
Thanks.

00:02:05.94,00:02:09.90
Most of us think of chocolate and[br]baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

00:02:10.10,00:02:13.06
Some people insist on[br]giving live chicks as presents.

00:02:14.18,00:02:19.09
Unfortunately, most of these guys[br]won 't live to see the 4th of July.

00:02:19.30,00:02:22.45
As a result of improper care,[br]they will be dead.

00:02:22.98,00:02:24.70
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

00:02:24.90,00:02:29.81
I was watching this commercial on Tv,[br]and, man, those things are cute!

00:02:33.42,00:02:36.89
Pete, you're back![br]Hey, check this out!

00:02:37.18,00:02:39.13
Skates!

00:02:42.46,00:02:46.09
You're sturdier than Chandler.[br]He crumbled like a piece of paper.

00:02:46.34,00:02:47.37
How was your trip?

00:02:48.18,00:02:50.09
What'd you bring me?

00:02:51.38,00:02:54.53
Hotel toiletries from Japan!

00:02:54.78,00:02:56.85
These are gonna go[br]in my permanent collection.

00:02:57.54,00:02:59.37
-Want some coffee?[br]-That'd be great.

00:03:03.38,00:03:04.57
Regular or decaf?

00:03:05.46,00:03:06.94
Whichever's closest.

00:03:08.46,00:03:11.21
-Ask me what I did today.[br]-What did you do today?

00:03:11.42,00:03:14.89
I bought a restaurant[br]and I'd like you to be the chef.

00:03:20.38,00:03:22.49
Can you believe he[br]offered me a restaurant?

00:03:22.74,00:03:25.70
What a jerk.[br]You want me to kick his ass?

00:03:26.38,00:03:29.13
It's been my dream since[br]I got my first Easy-Bake Oven. . .

00:03:29.38,00:03:31.89
. . .and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.

00:03:38.58,00:03:41.73
I would kill for this job.[br]I can totally do this job. . .

00:03:41.98,00:03:45.49
. . .and God knows, I've paid my dues.

00:03:46.90,00:03:49.54
But Pete's doing this[br]because he has a crush on me.

00:03:49.78,00:03:52.29
And you're still not[br]attracted to him at all?

00:03:53.78,00:03:56.29
How could I accept a restaurant[br]from him? I can't.

00:03:56.54,00:03:59.53
I couldn't accept a necklace[br]from Stu vincent in the 7th grade.

00:03:59.74,00:04:03.70
But, Mon, that was totally different.[br]He was your health teacher.

00:04:04.90,00:04:06.30
What, honey?

00:04:06.74,00:04:09.21
My side hurts from when[br]you crashed into me.

00:04:09.46,00:04:10.94
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

00:04:11.18,00:04:12.37
Oh, God!

00:04:13.26,00:04:14.85
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

00:04:19.46,00:04:21.02
Got a job on a riverboat?

00:04:23.14,00:04:26.05
I didn't wear this suit for a year,[br]because you hated it.

00:04:26.30,00:04:28.33
You're not my girlfriend[br]anymore, so: : : :

00:04:28.58,00:04:30.69
I see. This suit is making a point.

00:04:30.94,00:04:35.01
Now that you're on your own, you're[br]free to look as stupid as you'd like.

00:04:35.74,00:04:36.61
You like it, right?

00:04:36.86,00:04:40.17
I like it even more on you[br]than I did on Colonel Sanders.

00:04:41.02,00:04:42.69
Ross, I'm kidding. Come here.

00:04:42.90,00:04:44.49
What were you gonna tell us?

00:04:44.70,00:04:47.26
Was it how you[br]invented the cotton gin?

00:04:48.82,00:04:51.38
So after you put the suggestion[br]in the box. . .

00:04:51.62,00:04:53.85
. . .how long did it take[br]for it to happen?

00:04:54.10,00:04:55.74
About three months.

00:04:55.98,00:05:00.26
So I guess that's about two weeks[br]before the topless thing kicks in.

00:05:05.58,00:05:08.69
I got you something.[br]Open it! Open it!

00:05:15.90,00:05:17.38
It's a chicken.

00:05:18.74,00:05:19.97
It's cute, huh?

00:05:20.18,00:05:22.41
You guys? Do you know[br]anything about chicks?

00:05:22.66,00:05:24.73
Fowl? No.

00:05:25.06,00:05:27.25
Women? No.

00:05:28.30,00:05:30.49
They are a huge responsibility.

00:05:30.74,00:05:33.41
Especially at this age.[br]They require constant care.

00:05:33.66,00:05:36.69
They need just the right food[br]and lots and lots of love.

00:05:36.94,00:05:39.33
Well, no problem there.

00:05:44.66,00:05:45.65
Easy, Lenny.

00:05:50.46,00:05:53.10
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

00:05:53.38,00:05:54.57
Okay, here's the thing.

00:05:54.82,00:05:57.62
Not "the thing. "[br]I hate "the thing. "

00:05:57.82,00:05:59.01
What's "the thing"?

00:06:00.58,00:06:01.73
I can't do it.

00:06:01.98,00:06:03.73
I'm sorry. I wish I could. . .

00:06:03.98,00:06:06.65
. . .but you have these feelings for me.

00:06:06.90,00:06:08.93
That's what you're worried about?

00:06:09.18,00:06:11.69
If that's the problem,[br]we've got no problem.

00:06:12.90,00:06:16.45
I was gonna tell you over dinner,[br]but I met somebody else, on my trip.

00:06:17.94,00:06:20.77
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.[br]We met on the plane.

00:06:20.98,00:06:22.38
She wanted to finish off[br]my peanuts.

00:06:22.58,00:06:25.41
I thought she said something else.[br]We had a big laugh.

00:06:28.10,00:06:30.33
I got tired of waiting.

00:06:30.58,00:06:35.49
That's great. I'm sorry,[br]but I'm so happy for you.

00:06:35.86,00:06:37.89
-Now I can work for you![br]-I guess you can.

00:06:38.14,00:06:41.89
Oh, my God! This is incredible!

00:06:42.74,00:06:46.13
You know what? I'm gonna roll[br]right into that office and quit!

00:06:46.38,00:06:47.89
All right!

00:06:48.34,00:06:50.25
Could you give me a little push?

00:06:50.50,00:06:51.29
Good luck!

00:06:51.54,00:06:53.21
I'm quitting!

00:06:57.26,00:06:59.49
I'm okay! I'm all right!

00:07:02.66,00:07:06.21
That's exciting.[br]You went to Japan, made up a woman.

00:07:06.78,00:07:07.97
What?

00:07:08.26,00:07:12.01
I'm just saying, this "woman,"[br]I mean, she's fictitious, no?

00:07:12.86,00:07:14.97
-Why would you say that?[br]-You're still into Monica.

00:07:15.22,00:07:18.05
You said there's somebody else[br]so she'd work with you.

00:07:18.30,00:07:21.41
If you spend time together,[br]maybe something might happen.

00:07:22.78,00:07:24.65
You're good. You're good.

00:07:25.42,00:07:28.38
No, I'm fairly intuitive. And psychic.

00:07:28.78,00:07:30.69
It's a substantial gift.

00:07:32.06,00:07:34.53
Can you promise me[br]that you won't tell her?

00:07:34.78,00:07:38.29
Absolutely. I promise.[br]Tell her what?

00:07:39.18,00:07:40.37
Thanks a lot.

00:07:40.70,00:07:43.29
No, I'm serious.[br]I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.

00:07:45.46,00:07:47.49
Okay, but this is the last time.

00:07:48.18,00:07:50.90
With a chick-chick here[br]And a chick-chick there

00:07:51.14,00:07:53.70
Here a chick, there a chick[br]Everywhere a chick-chick

00:07:53.94,00:07:55.29
Chicken....

00:07:58.98,00:08:00.49
How's she doing?

00:08:00.86,00:08:01.85
She?

00:08:02.46,00:08:04.10
Don't you think it's a she?

00:08:04.90,00:08:06.22
I don't know.

00:08:15.90,00:08:18.49
I can't tell. Whatever it was[br]went back in too quickly.

00:08:19.94,00:08:22.90
I gotta change. I'm meeting[br]some of the cast for drinks.

00:08:23.14,00:08:24.25
Excuse me?

00:08:24.50,00:08:25.49
What?

00:08:25.94,00:08:27.97
I stayed home while[br]you were at rehearsal. . .

00:08:28.22,00:08:30.65
. . .so somebody could be here[br]with our chick.

00:08:30.94,00:08:34.73
Who was up from 2:00 this[br]morning until 5:00. . .

00:08:34.98,00:08:36.89
. . .trying to get her back to sleep?

00:08:37.46,00:08:39.37
You don't think I get up[br]when you get up?

00:08:40.42,00:08:41.61
Oh, here it comes.

00:08:41.86,00:08:45.29
Yes! Here it comes![br]I'm stuck here all day!

00:08:45.54,00:08:48.45
And then you come in[br]and spend two seconds with us. . .

00:08:50.18,00:08:53.41
. . .and then expect to go off[br]gallivanting with your friends?

00:08:53.66,00:08:55.53
Well, I don't think so, mister!

00:08:56.54,00:08:59.57
I need to relax, okay?[br]I was working all day.

00:09:00.34,00:09:03.30
And you don't think[br]taking care of our chick is work?

00:09:05.94,00:09:08.33
That's not what I said.[br]I just meant--

00:09:08.58,00:09:11.09
I know what you meant!

00:09:16.98,00:09:19.70
Did you notice that ever since[br]we got this chick. . .

00:09:20.18,00:09:22.90
. . .we've been fighting[br]a lot more than we used to?

00:09:24.90,00:09:27.70
I don't know, maybe we weren't[br]ready to have a chick.

00:09:29.58,00:09:31.49
I'll take her back tomorrow.

00:09:32.10,00:09:33.45
We'll get our $3 back?

00:09:39.02,00:09:42.09
I have that Tv thing in two hours,[br]and I need your help.

00:09:42.30,00:09:46.26
What do you think?[br]This blue suit or this brown one?

00:09:46.58,00:09:48.41
The brown one brings out your eyes.

00:09:48.62,00:09:51.50
But your butt looks great[br]in the blue one.

00:09:52.74,00:09:53.93
Really?

00:10:07.66,00:10:10.30
That aspirin dance really works.

00:10:13.10,00:10:15.41
-Is that still. . .?[br]-I'm fine.

00:10:15.66,00:10:17.45
-No, you're not![br]-Yes, I am.

00:10:17.70,00:10:20.29
Look, I'm fine.[br]Watch. Look at that.

00:10:22.02,00:10:24.74
You've got to go to a doctor, okay?

00:10:24.98,00:10:27.81
I have to get ready and go[br]to a dinner at my boss's house.

00:10:28.06,00:10:30.17
There's people there[br]that I have to meet.

00:10:30.42,00:10:33.33
I'm sure you'll make a great[br]impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.

00:10:33.58,00:10:35.09
It's nice to meet you. "

00:10:36.50,00:10:38.25
Come on, you probably[br]have a broken rib.

00:10:38.50,00:10:41.65
I'll go to the hospital tomorrow.[br]It'll still be broken then.

00:10:41.86,00:10:44.09
But you know, I could use a hand[br]getting ready.

00:10:44.34,00:10:46.41
Either help me, or go.

00:10:46.66,00:10:47.93
Fine. I'll go.

00:10:49.38,00:10:51.61
But before you go,[br]could you help me first?

00:10:55.30,00:10:57.29
Sure. I'll help you.

00:10:58.22,00:11:01.45
Good! Do you guys know how[br]to get a chick out of a vCR?

00:11:10.38,00:11:14.61
You know what?[br]I cannot do this with my left hand.

00:11:14.86,00:11:17.21
Would you please help me[br]with this too?

00:11:25.10,00:11:26.82
Let's use this brush.

00:11:27.66,00:11:29.14
-This stuff?[br]-Careful.

00:11:29.38,00:11:30.25
Light.

00:11:30.50,00:11:34.62
Just sweep it across the lid.[br]Just sweep it.

00:11:35.30,00:11:36.45
Sorry!

00:11:37.14,00:11:38.57
That's just poking me in the eye.

00:11:38.78,00:11:40.01
I'm sorry. Close. . . .

00:11:40.26,00:11:42.13
-Just sweep it.[br]-I'm sweeping.

00:11:42.54,00:11:44.33
Sweep, sweep. . . .

00:11:44.78,00:11:46.77
Now make it even,[br]because we don't. . . .

00:11:47.22,00:11:49.86
I don't want it to be too much.[br]I want it to be subtle.

00:11:50.10,00:11:52.98
You don't wear enough of this.

00:11:57.14,00:12:00.81
Since when do you think[br]I don't wear enough of this?

00:12:01.06,00:12:03.53
Close your eye.[br]You're gonna like this better. . . .

00:12:05.26,00:12:07.17
-Close, close.[br]-Blow it.

00:12:08.38,00:12:11.73
Because I think this will make you[br]a little more sophisticated.

00:12:12.30,00:12:14.21
Sophisticated like a hooker?

00:12:18.22,00:12:19.97
-Guess what I'm doing tonight.[br]-What?

00:12:20.18,00:12:22.01
I'm checking out[br]the restaurant with Pete.

00:12:22.26,00:12:24.53
Monica, I am so excited for you!

00:12:25.86,00:12:27.18
I have to tell you something.

00:12:27.50,00:12:28.29
What?

00:12:28.54,00:12:29.94
I can't tell you.

00:12:31.50,00:12:34.89
Wouldn't it be easier to tell[br]me something that you could tell me?

00:12:35.14,00:12:37.09
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

00:12:38.86,00:12:42.49
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,[br]and I swore to all my Gods.

00:12:45.58,00:12:47.61
Does it have to do with[br]Ross and Rachel?

00:12:48.62,00:12:49.81
Does it have to do with Joey?

00:12:50.94,00:12:54.33
Does it have to do with Chandler[br]and that sock he keeps by his bed?

00:12:56.54,00:12:58.33
No, but let's come back to that later.

00:13:02.38,00:13:05.73
There you go![br]Good enough for your party?

00:13:11.54,00:13:12.73
Sure.

00:13:13.46,00:13:17.61
Sure. I'll just sit next to[br]the transsexual from purchasing.

00:13:22.06,00:13:25.21
All right, I gotta go,[br]So good luck at the party.

00:13:25.46,00:13:28.21
Could you just stay[br]and help me get dressed?

00:13:30.58,00:13:31.90
Sure.

00:13:32.66,00:13:35.97
Great. Okay, just turn around.

00:13:36.38,00:13:37.29
What?

00:13:37.54,00:13:39.45
I don't want you to see me naked.

00:13:39.70,00:13:43.41
I've seen you naked a million times.[br]I ate hot fudge off you naked.

00:13:43.66,00:13:46.65
I sucked that mini-marshmallow[br]out of your bellybutton.

00:13:47.98,00:13:50.49
Yeah, but that was different.[br]We were going out then.

00:13:50.74,00:13:52.33
Now it's weird.

00:13:52.58,00:13:55.97
Rach, you know, I can see[br]you naked anytime I want.

00:13:56.58,00:13:57.53
What?

00:13:58.34,00:14:02.09
All I have to do is close my eyes.[br]See?

00:14:05.46,00:14:08.05
Ross, stop that!

00:14:08.98,00:14:11.45
Come on! Don't think of me[br]like that anymore.

00:14:11.70,00:14:13.34
Sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

00:14:13.58,00:14:16.01
It's one of my rights[br]as the ex-boyfriend.

00:14:19.06,00:14:22.25
Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!

00:14:22.50,00:14:24.53
I'm sorry. It will never happen--

00:14:24.78,00:14:26.13
Wait a minute! Wait, wait. . . .

00:14:26.38,00:14:29.49
Now there are 1 00 of you,[br]and I'm the king!

00:14:32.58,00:14:34.33
Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

00:14:35.86,00:14:38.37
All right. Fine.

00:14:42.50,00:14:45.46
See what you did?[br]I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

00:14:46.90,00:14:49.37
Oh, my God. All right, look, look. . . .

00:14:50.26,00:14:53.37
Easy. Easy.[br]You have to go to the hospital, okay?

00:14:53.62,00:14:55.34
I do. I really do.

00:14:55.58,00:14:57.97
I'll get your coat,[br]then I'll put you in a cab.

00:14:58.22,00:14:59.89
You're not gonna come with me?

00:15:03.38,00:15:05.49
Of course I am.

00:15:05.70,00:15:07.49
I just have to make a call.

00:15:08.58,00:15:09.81
Thank you.

00:15:15.66,00:15:16.65
What's wrong?

00:15:16.90,00:15:20.29
I'm sorry. I just can't go[br]to the hospital looking like this.

00:15:21.58,00:15:23.57
Does it involve travel?

00:15:23.86,00:15:25.93
Does it involve clogs?

00:15:26.18,00:15:28.53
Clogs or claws?

00:15:28.98,00:15:29.81
Clogs.

00:15:30.58,00:15:32.06
Claws?

00:15:34.74,00:15:38.45
So it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel[br]or Chandler or Joey.

00:15:38.94,00:15:39.97
What about Pete?

00:15:41.10,00:15:42.69
What is it?

00:15:43.46,00:15:46.05
-What about Pete?[br]-I don't know!

00:15:47.50,00:15:48.93
I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

00:15:50.94,00:15:54.33
-Phoebe, would you just tell me?[br]-I can't!

00:15:54.58,00:15:57.33
-I gotta go.[br]-But you're so close!

00:15:57.58,00:15:59.37
Something to do[br]with Pete's company?

00:15:59.62,00:16:01.10
Go! You'll never get it!

00:16:10.38,00:16:11.57
I know.

00:16:13.26,00:16:15.33
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

00:16:15.54,00:16:18.21
She's a completely different[br]kind of chick.

00:16:22.06,00:16:23.89
I love you both.

00:16:25.06,00:16:27.53
But in very different ways.

00:16:32.42,00:16:35.09
What are you doing?[br]You were gonna take her back.

00:16:35.30,00:16:37.13
I did. But the store[br]wouldn't take her back.

00:16:37.38,00:16:40.49
Then I took her to the shelter.[br]You know what I found out?

00:16:46.26,00:16:49.49
If they can't find a home for her,[br]they kill her!

00:16:49.90,00:16:52.05
I won't let that happen[br]to little Jasmine.

00:16:54.34,00:16:58.54
Good, good, because I was[br]kind of having second thoughts too.

00:16:58.78,00:17:01.97
And it's not just chicks.[br]It's all kinds of other animals.

00:17:02.22,00:17:04.61
That's horrible.[br]You did the right thing.

00:17:04.86,00:17:07.74
Thanks. I'm glad[br]you see it that way.

00:17:18.78,00:17:20.29
Funny story!

00:17:22.90,00:17:24.85
I don't believe this!

00:17:25.10,00:17:28.29
Look at this refrigerator![br]It's gigantic!

00:17:28.54,00:17:32.09
I could live in this thing![br]I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!

00:17:33.78,00:17:37.05
Oh, my God! Look at these spider[br]burners! I love spider burners!

00:17:37.30,00:17:38.65
So you like it?

00:17:38.90,00:17:42.49
It is so perfect![br]Thank you so much.

00:17:42.70,00:17:44.13
You're welcome.

00:17:50.54,00:17:51.94
Did you just smell my hair?

00:17:53.10,00:17:55.29
No! No way! What?

00:17:56.10,00:17:57.82
-Oh, God.[br]-What?

00:17:59.50,00:18:01.25
You still have feelings for me.

00:18:01.50,00:18:05.17
I'm just excited about the restaurant,[br]that's all.

00:18:06.10,00:18:07.50
I love you. Is that so bad?

00:18:09.50,00:18:11.69
No, it's not bad.[br]It's not bad at all.

00:18:11.90,00:18:13.69
It's really nice.

00:18:14.14,00:18:17.73
The only one who stands to get hurt[br]is me, and I'm okay with that.

00:18:18.82,00:18:20.33
You may be okay with getting hurt. . .

00:18:20.58,00:18:23.69
. . .but I am not okay with being[br]the one who hurts you.

00:18:25.46,00:18:27.13
That's why I can't take this job.

00:18:27.38,00:18:28.49
What?

00:18:29.78,00:18:32.42
We probably shouldn't[br]see each other anymore.

00:18:33.38,00:18:34.70
I'm sorry.

00:18:37.22,00:18:41.05
I mean, if that's[br]really what you want, okay.

00:18:51.06,00:18:52.01
I'm sorry things--

00:18:52.22,00:18:56.10
Shut up for a second[br]and let me just see something.

00:19:09.78,00:19:11.13
You'd tell me the truth?

00:19:11.38,00:19:14.65
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.

00:19:16.58,00:19:20.89
Now you stay out here[br]and you think about what you did!

00:19:22.54,00:19:24.97
-That's a duck![br]-That's a bad duck!

00:19:27.78,00:19:30.09
How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?

00:19:31.50,00:19:32.73
What thing? What thing?

00:19:32.98,00:19:35.89
Nothing. There was this thing[br]at the museum. Come on.

00:19:36.14,00:19:37.17
Easy.

00:19:38.82,00:19:43.10
Now, when you come back, I hope you[br]remember that that chick is not a toy!

00:19:47.14,00:19:48.93
What "thing"? What is this "thing"?

00:19:49.18,00:19:53.33
I was kind of supposed to be on Tv[br]tonight for the Discovery Channel.

00:19:53.86,00:19:55.65
Oh, my God!

00:19:55.90,00:19:57.57
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

00:19:57.82,00:20:00.41
I knew that if I told you,[br]you'd make me go. . .

00:20:00.66,00:20:04.54
. . .and I knew you needed someone[br]to be with you tonight. Come on.

00:20:05.38,00:20:07.61
-I cannot believe you.[br]-What?

00:20:07.86,00:20:10.69
That is the sweetest thing.

00:20:20.58,00:20:22.01
You should get some sleep.

00:20:24.98,00:20:26.54
Sorry I spoiled your evening.

00:20:26.78,00:20:28.89
As long as you're okay.

00:20:29.10,00:20:32.06
So I'll see you tomorrow.

00:20:40.78,00:20:42.01
See you.

00:20:54.18,00:20:55.45
What did you do?

00:21:06.26,00:21:07.25
What you doing?

00:21:07.46,00:21:09.25
Having a swim.

00:21:09.78,00:21:11.69
What about the chick?

00:21:12.06,00:21:13.49
Chicks don't swim.

00:21:13.70,00:21:15.13
Are you sure?

00:21:16.94,00:21:18.50
I don't know.

00:21:19.82,00:21:21.61
-Should we try?[br]-Sure.

00:21:29.18,00:21:31.69
See, I told you.[br]They don't swim.

00:21:32.38,00:21:34.02
Well, give him a minute.

00:21:35.98,00:21:39.69
It's okay.[br]It's okay, baby, baby, baby.

00:00:03.06,00:00:04.49
Are you still on hold?

00:00:04.70,00:00:07.00
I was supposed to call my dad back[br]two hours ago.

00:00:07.26,00:00:08.69
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

00:00:08.94,00:00:11.81
Call him as soon as you get a chance.[br]He's at Flimbees.

00:00:12.34,00:00:13.21
What's Flimbees?

00:00:13.42,00:00:16.29
That's the word I use when[br]I can't remember the real thing.

00:00:17.86,00:00:20.09
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

00:00:20.30,00:00:22.33
No. That's what they want me to do.

00:00:22.58,00:00:25.09
My warranty expires tomorrow.[br]If I don't get through. . .

00:00:25.30,00:00:27.89
. . .they won't fix my crappy,[br]broken phone for free!

00:00:28.10,00:00:30.13
We cannot let them win![br]It's us versus them!

00:00:30.38,00:00:31.69
Yes!

00:00:35.26,00:00:38.29
I gotta double-check for tickets[br]tonight. Who got what?

00:00:38.54,00:00:39.49
I have one.

00:00:39.74,00:00:42.04
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

00:00:42.38,00:00:43.57
My boyfriend.

00:00:45.54,00:00:47.57
I have a boyfriend now.

00:00:47.98,00:00:49.49
Two it is. How about you?

00:00:50.78,00:00:52.61
Yeah, I also need two.

00:00:53.38,00:00:55.13
Really? Who's number two?

00:00:55.38,00:00:59.69
Whose Number Two? One of the more[br]difficult games sewer workers play.

00:01:01.58,00:01:03.61
No, it's just this person.

00:01:03.98,00:01:05.57
Like a date-type person?

00:01:05.90,00:01:08.49
Yeah, kind of.[br]It's this woman from work.

00:01:08.74,00:01:11.49
I hope that won't be too weird.[br]Will it, Rach?

00:01:12.78,00:01:15.73
Not at all. I was actually[br]gonna bring someone myself.

00:01:16.14,00:01:18.13
But you said one ticket.

00:01:21.26,00:01:23.61
I meant me plus one.

00:01:24.14,00:01:26.65
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

00:01:28.78,00:01:30.53
All right. I'll see you tonight.

00:01:30.78,00:01:31.69
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:01:31.94,00:01:32.85
Bye-bye.

00:01:33.74,00:01:34.85
Okay, I need a date!

00:01:36.78,00:01:40.09
Oh, hey! You guys are finally[br]gonna get to meet Kate!

00:01:40.30,00:01:42.76
And I borrowed your cologne.[br]I hope she likes it.

00:01:42.98,00:01:45.54
What are you doing?[br]She's seeing somebody.

00:01:45.78,00:01:47.97
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

00:01:48.78,00:01:52.21
-Bottle next to the shaving cream.[br]-Worm medicine for the duck.

00:02:42.46,00:02:44.89
-Here you go. You can wear this.[br]-Thanks.

00:02:48.42,00:02:50.17
I'm setting the phone down.

00:02:51.34,00:02:52.65
But I'm still here.

00:02:53.66,00:02:55.89
Just don't go anywhere.[br]I'm still here.

00:02:56.34,00:03:00.25
Don't switch or anything, because[br]I'm right here. Just one sec.

00:03:01.66,00:03:03.65
One sec. One second!

00:03:04.14,00:03:06.25
Wait! One second! Just. . . .

00:03:06.94,00:03:08.85
What? Monica, I'm scared!

00:03:09.86,00:03:11.97
Honey, that's a sleeve.

00:03:13.14,00:03:15.60
And we also have a speakerphone.

00:03:15.86,00:03:18.93
Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is important to us.

00:03:19.18,00:03:21.09
You gotta hang up.[br]We'll be late.

00:03:21.30,00:03:23.89
Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

00:03:24.14,00:03:26.44
Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

00:03:26.94,00:03:29.29
You were gonna have me hang up.

00:03:32.78,00:03:34.93
Can you take a duck and a chick[br]to the theater?

00:03:36.30,00:03:37.61
Of course not.

00:03:37.94,00:03:40.61
I just wanted them to hear it[br]from somebody else.

00:03:48.90,00:03:50.49
Oh, hi, how are you?

00:03:50.74,00:03:51.77
Good.

00:03:53.54,00:03:56.33
-Looks like we're the first ones here.[br]-Looks that way.

00:03:56.58,00:03:57.69
First ones here!

00:04:01.18,00:04:03.69
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.[br]Ross, Tommy.

00:04:03.90,00:04:06.09
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.[br]Cailin--

00:04:06.34,00:04:07.25
Sorry.

00:04:07.86,00:04:08.89
And break!

00:04:12.98,00:04:15.36
I think I'm gonna run[br]to the ladies' room.

00:04:15.58,00:04:17.69
-I'll join you.[br]-I'll get our seats.

00:04:19.98,00:04:21.37
Well, this is. . .

00:04:21.62,00:04:22.68
. . .awkward.

00:04:24.30,00:04:26.89
Well, because Rachel and I[br]used to go out.

00:04:27.14,00:04:28.73
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:04:30.94,00:04:33.53
Well, then this is awkward.

00:04:35.18,00:04:37.64
-So what do you. . .?[br]-I think we're here.

00:04:39.90,00:04:41.69
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:04:41.90,00:04:44.01
I think you may be in our seats.

00:04:45.78,00:04:47.25
No, I don't think so.

00:04:47.46,00:04:49.89
-Could we take a look at your ticket?[br]-Sure.

00:04:51.78,00:04:54.41
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" . . . .

00:04:55.54,00:04:57.09
Oh, well, I thought that--

00:04:57.30,00:05:00.81
You thought? Well, that didn't[br]really work out for you. Idiot!

00:05:02.50,00:05:05.85
What are you, a moron?[br]It says, "D-1 3" ! Okay?

00:05:06.18,00:05:09.09
You're surrounded by even numbers![br]Does that give you a clue?

00:05:09.58,00:05:12.21
-The usher told me--[br]-The usher must be right!

00:05:12.46,00:05:14.09
With all his training!

00:05:14.54,00:05:15.60
Get out!

00:05:16.58,00:05:17.45
Here!

00:05:21.06,00:05:23.49
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?[br]-No, I'm good.

00:05:35.26,00:05:37.13
-There he is![br]-There's our star!

00:05:37.38,00:05:38.89
You were great!

00:05:39.10,00:05:40.29
So? What'd you think?

00:05:40.58,00:05:44.28
Almost as good as the play with[br]the two naked girls on the seesaw.

00:05:45.18,00:05:47.09
-I wasn't in that.[br]-I know.

00:05:48.06,00:05:51.13
I want you to meet everybody.[br]Everybody, this is Kate.

00:05:51.38,00:05:53.68
Excuse me. Excuse me.[br]Sweetheart!

00:05:56.54,00:05:57.49
Come!

00:06:01.14,00:06:03.29
So that's the girl you like.

00:06:05.38,00:06:07.94
I tell you, this guy[br]Rachel is with is crazy.

00:06:08.18,00:06:12.77
He viciously screamed at total[br]strangers. I think he's bad news.

00:06:14.26,00:06:17.65
Wait a minute. You don't like[br]the guy Rachel's dating?

00:06:18.06,00:06:19.12
Well, that's odd.

00:06:20.62,00:06:24.53
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is[br]Kate's understudy, Lauren.

00:06:24.78,00:06:26.69
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

00:06:26.94,00:06:29.53
I ran into you in the hallway[br]in your building.

00:06:29.78,00:06:33.48
It was right after I slept with Joey.[br]He dumped me the next day.

00:06:35.18,00:06:37.05
So how'd you guys meet?

00:06:37.90,00:06:41.13
The short version is, I pursued[br]her for a couple of months.

00:06:41.38,00:06:44.33
Then I gave her a check for $20,000[br]and she was mine.

00:06:45.98,00:06:50.29
In the long version, I dump him[br]for telling people the short version.

00:06:51.06,00:06:53.41
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

00:06:54.98,00:06:56.93
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

00:06:57.18,00:06:58.29
How do you do?

00:06:58.50,00:07:01.45
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

00:07:01.98,00:07:03.97
Do they have representation?

00:07:04.90,00:07:06.57
They weren't in the play.

00:07:06.90,00:07:08.12
We're not actors.

00:07:08.46,00:07:09.33
What a shame!

00:07:09.78,00:07:13.73
With her face and her chest,[br]I could really put something together.

00:07:15.90,00:07:17.21
Could I borrow it?

00:07:19.58,00:07:21.33
Hi. Remember me?

00:07:22.06,00:07:24.62
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line[br]for the bathroom. . .

00:07:24.86,00:07:27.77
. . .and someone just cut.[br]I think he's gonna snap.

00:07:29.30,00:07:30.49
I'm gonna go.

00:07:30.86,00:07:32.08
Go? Why?

00:07:32.30,00:07:34.97
I don't know. Could be[br]because I don't feel like. . .

00:07:35.22,00:07:38.21
. . .waiting all night for a guy[br]who may or may not scream.

00:07:40.70,00:07:42.73
He definitely will scream.

00:07:43.98,00:07:45.09
Goodbye.

00:07:49.14,00:07:50.69
Here we go, people!

00:07:56.98,00:07:58.37
"Boxing Day.

00:07:59.30,00:08:01.17
The Lucille Lortel Theatre. . . .

00:08:03.18,00:08:07.65
Joey Tribbiani gives[br]an uneven performance.

00:08:08.14,00:08:11.21
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst[br]thing in this production. "

00:08:11.46,00:08:12.41
Yes!

00:08:15.98,00:08:20.21
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered[br]portrayal is laughable. "

00:08:21.50,00:08:23.61
Here it is! "The direction. . .

00:08:23.86,00:08:26.97
. . .by Marshall Townend is. . . . "

00:08:32.98,00:08:34.53
Thank you, boys and girls.

00:08:34.78,00:08:37.29
You've ruined my life.

00:08:37.58,00:08:40.89
Please stuff your talentless faces. . .

00:08:41.10,00:08:43.45
. . .with my mother's crab cakes!

00:08:44.26,00:08:45.48
Excuse me!

00:08:51.06,00:08:52.93
Does anyone mind if I save this?

00:08:58.26,00:09:00.05
-Is the play over?[br]-Where were you?

00:09:00.58,00:09:04.09
Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

00:09:04.50,00:09:07.89
You were "the next caller" hours ago.[br]You must be going crazy.

00:09:08.14,00:09:10.21
I've kept myself busy.

00:09:18.30,00:09:22.29
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in[br]her room and her stuff in your room.

00:09:28.30,00:09:29.13
You okay?

00:09:30.50,00:09:31.37
Fabulous.

00:09:31.70,00:09:36.33
Drama critics, they're nothing but[br]people who couldn't make it as actors.

00:09:36.58,00:09:38.81
-You know what to do?[br]-Become a drama critic.

00:09:43.58,00:09:44.89
I am hurt!

00:09:47.78,00:09:49.09
A plague. . .

00:09:49.46,00:09:51.57
. . .on both your houses!

00:09:54.06,00:09:57.49
By the way, he dumped me tonight[br]after he read my review.

00:09:57.70,00:09:59.41
Oh, classy.

00:10:01.50,00:10:03.33
I sure know how to pick them.

00:10:04.94,00:10:07.89
You know I gave up a part[br]on a soap for this?

00:10:10.30,00:10:11.57
I gave up a job too.

00:10:11.98,00:10:14.81
-Really? What?[br]-Declawing cats.

00:10:16.78,00:10:19.34
Hey, tell you what,[br]let me walk you home.

00:10:19.58,00:10:23.57
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn[br]every copy of The Times and The Post.

00:10:23.86,00:10:26.01
-Why The Post?[br]-You didn't see The Post?

00:10:26.26,00:10:28.93
-No. You?[br]-No. Why?

00:10:36.10,00:10:38.89
You really think these newspapers[br]are just jealous of me?

00:10:39.10,00:10:42.25
Absolutely. You're talented[br]and you're good-looking.

00:10:42.74,00:10:45.12
You're sweet and cute.

00:10:45.38,00:10:47.68
I know. That's why they trashed me.

00:10:54.66,00:10:56.65
-Wait. Wait a minute.[br]-What?

00:10:58.58,00:11:00.29
I don't get you.

00:11:00.50,00:11:02.37
I mean, first you hate me.

00:11:02.66,00:11:05.17
Then you sleep with me.

00:11:05.58,00:11:08.33
Then you want nothing to do with me.[br]Now you want me again?

00:11:08.58,00:11:11.04
You never went out[br]with an actress before?

00:11:12.50,00:11:15.09
Kate, do you even like me?

00:11:17.86,00:11:21.29
-Of course I do.[br]-So how come you blew me off?

00:11:21.54,00:11:24.81
-How come you were with him?[br]-I don't know.

00:11:25.46,00:11:27.13
I just do this.

00:11:27.66,00:11:30.53
I always have to pick, like,[br]the smartest guy. . .

00:11:30.78,00:11:32.29
. . .or the most talented guy.

00:11:33.58,00:11:35.88
Why can't I just[br]pick someone like you?

00:11:38.98,00:11:40.04
Thanks.

00:11:42.34,00:11:43.81
You know what I mean.

00:11:45.70,00:11:47.97
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

00:11:49.46,00:11:51.01
You're just so. . . .

00:11:52.30,00:11:53.41
You're so. . .

00:11:54.70,00:11:55.61
: : :so: : : :

00:12:06.98,00:12:09.54
Here we go.[br]Let's get your feet up there.

00:12:17.06,00:12:18.41
Good night.

00:12:19.54,00:12:20.85
Sweet dreams.

00:12:27.38,00:12:30.69
I'm gonna put this can right here[br]in case you have to hurl.

00:12:38.78,00:12:42.69
Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is very important to us.

00:12:43.74,00:12:46.93
You've been up for 24 hours.[br]Go to sleep.

00:12:47.18,00:12:48.29
This isn't healthy.

00:12:48.50,00:12:50.09
No, no, I'm fine.

00:12:50.30,00:12:53.61
And you know why?[br]Because of all the riboflavin.

00:12:58.82,00:13:00.73
Didn't you have that on last night?

00:13:01.54,00:13:03.45
I stayed at Kate's[br]but nothing happened.

00:13:04.58,00:13:06.01
Hey, where were you?

00:13:06.26,00:13:09.88
I'm so, so sorry.[br]I am definitely gonna see your play.

00:13:10.10,00:13:13.33
I swear, your play is very important[br]to us. Thank you for your patience.

00:13:13.58,00:13:16.37
Your play is the next play[br]I'm gonna see.

00:13:18.18,00:13:19.49
How'd it go with Kate?

00:13:19.70,00:13:20.49
It was great!

00:13:20.70,00:13:25.21
I walked her home, and it was[br]amazing how much we connected.

00:13:25.46,00:13:26.81
Then she passed out.

00:13:27.06,00:13:28.73
But then she woke up.

00:13:28.98,00:13:31.28
And we stayed up all night talking.

00:13:31.50,00:13:33.57
And now we're crazy about each other!

00:13:35.18,00:13:36.53
You had "the night" !

00:13:37.58,00:13:40.49
When two people realize[br]their feelings for each other. . .

00:13:40.70,00:13:44.09
. . .and they talk for hours and learn[br]all about the other person.

00:13:44.30,00:13:45.28
You think?

00:13:45.54,00:13:48.29
-Did you learn about her family?[br]-Two brothers. One died!

00:13:48.54,00:13:49.37
Yes!

00:13:56.38,00:13:58.29
This is from the woman at the bar.

00:14:02.86,00:14:05.49
Sorry. She thought[br]you were somebody else.

00:14:08.98,00:14:10.33
-What time is it?[br]-One.

00:14:10.58,00:14:11.97
7: 1 5.

00:14:12.98,00:14:14.33
Watch doesn't work.

00:14:15.58,00:14:18.69
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.[br]We're going to lunch.

00:14:21.06,00:14:24.76
Look, I wasn't gonna[br]say anything to you, but. . . .

00:14:24.98,00:14:28.49
All right, I don't think[br]you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

00:14:29.54,00:14:30.76
You don't?

00:14:30.98,00:14:35.13
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.[br]I think you should stay away from him.

00:14:36.26,00:14:39.49
Or maybe I should stay away[br]from all men.

00:14:39.90,00:14:42.09
It's not just because I'm jealous.

00:14:43.70,00:14:46.05
I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

00:14:46.66,00:14:50.97
Look, the guy actually screamed[br]at this couple sitting in our seats.

00:14:51.22,00:14:53.49
Yeah, and at the end of the play. . .

00:14:53.90,00:14:58.49
. . .he got up, and he just started,[br]like, banging his hands together.

00:15:00.86,00:15:03.29
You don't want to believe me,[br]that's fine.

00:15:03.54,00:15:04.65
We're kidding.

00:15:07.38,00:15:10.33
No one believe me.[br]I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

00:15:10.66,00:15:13.45
-Sorry, Tommy.[br]-What's in the cup?

00:15:15.02,00:15:17.09
What is in the cup?

00:15:17.30,00:15:18.36
Okay, it's coffee.

00:15:18.58,00:15:20.77
Iced coffee?[br]Tell me it's iced coffee.

00:15:22.38,00:15:24.81
-It's hot--[br]-Hot coffee!

00:15:25.38,00:15:28.73
You idiot! You gonna spill[br]hot coffee all over me, huh?

00:15:28.98,00:15:33.25
What are you? Just a big, stupid[br]doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

00:15:37.58,00:15:39.88
What's your favorite thing[br]about summertime?

00:15:40.14,00:15:43.97
Going to the beach[br]when it stays light real late.

00:15:48.74,00:15:50.81
What's your favorite thing[br]about summer?

00:15:51.78,00:15:54.81
I don't know. Probably the smell[br]of freshly cut grass.

00:15:55.18,00:15:56.77
That's a good one.

00:16:01.38,00:16:05.33
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and[br]my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

00:16:05.90,00:16:08.09
We held the curtain for you.[br]Let's go!

00:16:13.34,00:16:16.21
vic! Where have you been, baby?

00:16:20.38,00:16:21.25
Where's Kate?

00:16:21.50,00:16:22.81
She got a job in L.A.

00:16:25.58,00:16:30.21
I've been waiting up all night[br]for you. Where have you been?

00:16:31.10,00:16:33.37
Where have you been, vic?

00:16:35.30,00:16:39.08
Go to the window. I wanna run down[br]to the truck and show you something.

00:16:41.38,00:16:43.65
What do you got down there, vic?

00:16:43.90,00:16:46.28
What do you got under that tarp?

00:16:49.30,00:16:50.33
When is she leaving?

00:16:50.66,00:16:53.17
Tonight. What are you doing?

00:16:54.74,00:16:55.93
I'm coming up!

00:16:59.14,00:17:01.29
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

00:17:06.38,00:17:08.94
Use ours across the hall[br]because she. . .

00:17:09.18,00:17:10.49
. . .has problems.

00:17:10.74,00:17:11.69
Thanks.

00:17:14.74,00:17:15.53
Sorry, Tommy.

00:17:15.78,00:17:18.45
I almost spilled this[br]hot coffee on you.

00:17:19.50,00:17:21.09
Yeah, but you didn't.

00:17:21.34,00:17:22.48
No, but. . .

00:17:23.06,00:17:24.20
. . .it's hot.

00:17:27.86,00:17:30.29
Would you stop it?[br]It's getting really old.

00:17:30.54,00:17:32.41
I can't believe no one believes me.

00:17:32.78,00:17:34.17
I do. I believe you.

00:17:34.74,00:17:35.57
You do?

00:17:35.82,00:17:39.01
Yeah. But I also believed her[br]when she said I was next.

00:17:46.74,00:17:48.21
Hey there, little fella.

00:17:48.50,00:17:50.69
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

00:17:54.90,00:17:55.81
Gross!

00:17:56.50,00:17:57.29
Idiot!

00:17:58.34,00:18:01.13
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

00:18:01.38,00:18:05.13
"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute![br]I'm a little chick who's disgusting! "

00:18:05.38,00:18:07.76
You're so stupid![br]How are you not yet extinct?

00:18:10.78,00:18:12.45
What are you quacking about?

00:18:12.86,00:18:14.41
Dumb Donald Dodo!

00:18:18.38,00:18:20.65
Step away from the duck.

00:18:23.94,00:18:25.89
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

00:18:26.10,00:18:28.05
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

00:18:30.98,00:18:33.01
I guess we're not going out anymore.

00:18:33.26,00:18:34.24
Man!

00:18:38.54,00:18:42.13
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.[br]I couldn't find you before.

00:18:42.54,00:18:44.37
What's all this about L.A.?

00:18:44.70,00:18:46.53
They still want me[br]for General Hospital.

00:18:46.74,00:18:47.57
But. . .

00:18:48.10,00:18:49.41
. . .what about us?

00:18:50.74,00:18:52.69
Last night was wonderful.

00:18:53.70,00:18:55.69
But I can't stay here just for you.

00:18:56.78,00:18:58.65
So stay for the museums.

00:18:59.50,00:19:01.65
-I'm sorry.[br]-Joey, on-stage!

00:19:02.34,00:19:04.33
At least stay till the end[br]of the play.

00:19:04.58,00:19:07.29
I'll go to the airport with you.[br]I want to say goodbye.

00:19:07.54,00:19:08.89
Where are you, vic?

00:19:09.38,00:19:11.57
Flight's in an hour.[br]I gotta go.

00:19:11.78,00:19:13.09
vic?

00:19:13.34,00:19:14.25
vic?

00:19:15.74,00:19:17.49
-vic![br]-In a minute!

00:19:19.98,00:19:22.25
So this is it, victor?

00:19:23.14,00:19:25.25
Yeah. I guess it is.

00:19:31.98,00:19:32.96
Listen. . .

00:19:34.78,00:19:38.37
. . .I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say[br]it quick because this is killing me.

00:19:38.98,00:19:43.37
One thing you gotta know[br]is that I will never forget you.

00:19:43.62,00:19:46.33
But you got things[br]you have to do now.

00:19:46.98,00:19:48.09
And so do l.

00:19:50.18,00:19:51.13
And so. . .

00:19:53.54,00:19:55.89
. . .I'm gonna get on[br]this spaceship. . .

00:20:02.98,00:20:07.09
. . .and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7[br]in search of alternative fuels.

00:20:07.98,00:20:11.17
But when I return[br]200 years from now. . .

00:20:11.70,00:20:13.81
. . .you'll be long gone. . .

00:20:14.38,00:20:16.33
. . .but I won't have aged at all.

00:20:19.78,00:20:23.09
So you tell your great,[br]great granddaughter. . .

00:20:23.50,00:20:24.69
. . .to look me up.

00:20:26.66,00:20:28.01
Because, Adrianne. . .

00:20:28.78,00:20:29.69
. . .baby. . .

00:20:31.94,00:20:33.89
. . .I'm gonna want to meet her.

00:20:41.42,00:20:43.05
So long, vic!

00:20:50.70,00:20:53.05
It's been two days.

00:20:53.74,00:20:54.77
Yeah, I know.

00:20:55.30,00:20:58.21
Good thing it's one of those[br]801 numbers, right?

00:20:58.42,00:21:03.13
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.[br]801 is Utah.

00:21:05.58,00:21:10.01
It has to be 800 because all those[br]big companies have 800 numbers.

00:21:10.26,00:21:11.17
Every. . . .

00:21:12.14,00:21:15.33
Yeah, every big Utah-based company[br]has one.

00:21:16.66,00:21:19.53
Sorry. I'm so sorry.[br]I will pay you back.

00:21:20.06,00:21:22.69
And yet she's still not[br]hanging up the phone.

00:21:22.90,00:21:24.49
-Hang up![br]-Hang up the phone!

00:21:24.78,00:21:26.13
Fine! Fine!

00:21:33.34,00:21:35.05
Well, I think I broke it.

00:21:37.54,00:21:41.08
But that's all right.[br]Here's the number where you can call.

00:00:03.51,00:00:06.47
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck[br]and our chick had a baby?

00:00:06.71,00:00:08.74
We could call it Chuck.

00:00:10.35,00:00:11.75
Or Dick.

00:00:15.51,00:00:17.74
Listen, I need a favor.

00:00:18.83,00:00:21.14
I was in the shower,[br]and as I was. . .

00:00:21.39,00:00:24.86
. . .cleansing myself, I felt something.

00:00:25.07,00:00:27.95
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

00:00:29.99,00:00:32.18
No. I mean, like,[br]a thing on my body.

00:00:32.83,00:00:33.98
Well, what was it?

00:00:34.19,00:00:37.66
Well, I don't know.[br]It's kind of in a place that's not. . . .

00:00:37.91,00:00:41.79
It's not visually accessible to me.[br]And I was hoping maybe you guys. . .

00:00:42.03,00:00:43.18
. . .could help me out.

00:00:45.91,00:00:47.94
Come on, you guys![br]It's no big deal!

00:00:52.11,00:00:54.75
Well, what is it?[br]ls it a mole?

00:00:56.39,00:00:58.95
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

00:00:59.19,00:01:00.94
Is it--?[br]What, a pimple?

00:01:04.23,00:01:05.34
No, it's. . .

00:01:05.91,00:01:07.79
. . .fancier than a pimple.

00:01:08.03,00:01:10.22
-Ross, just go see a doc--[br]-Guys, what's--?

00:01:15.63,00:01:18.38
Well, it's definite.[br]Two more weeks of winter.

00:01:18.59,00:01:19.38
Yeah, right.

00:01:20.59,00:01:22.54

00:02:09.71,00:02:13.18
And this is the coffeehouse.[br]This is where I play my music.

00:02:13.43,00:02:15.38
-Good deal.[br]-These are my friends.

00:02:15.63,00:02:18.62
People? This is vince.[br]vince, the people.

00:02:20.55,00:02:22.03
vince is a fireman.

00:02:23.11,00:02:25.46
Have you ever rescued anyone[br]from a burning building?

00:02:25.67,00:02:27.98
Ninety-eight hot saves.[br]Highest on the force.

00:02:28.19,00:02:32.02
If Joey and I play with matches,[br]we could get you up to an even 1 00.

00:02:34.03,00:02:36.18
Fire safety is not a joke, son.

00:02:38.55,00:02:40.14
You're right. I know.

00:02:41.31,00:02:43.34
Look, I gotta go.[br]I'm on call tonight.

00:02:43.59,00:02:44.58
See you Saturday.

00:02:47.95,00:02:49.06
He's cute, Pheebs.

00:02:49.31,00:02:51.30
But you just started dating[br]that teacher.

00:02:51.51,00:02:52.38
Oh, Jason?

00:02:52.63,00:02:54.38
We're seeing each other tonight.

00:02:54.63,00:02:56.27
Well, Pheebs?

00:02:56.55,00:02:59.11
Two dates in one day?[br]That's so unlike you.

00:02:59.31,00:03:02.38
I know, I know.[br]I'm, like, playing the field.

00:03:02.63,00:03:06.34
I'm juggling two guys.[br]I'm sowing my wild oats.

00:03:06.79,00:03:10.75
You know, this kind of, like,[br]oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

00:03:11.07,00:03:12.79
So do they know about each other?

00:03:13.39,00:03:15.58
Does a dog's lips move[br]when he reads?

00:03:19.83,00:03:21.74
Okay, no, they don't know.

00:03:23.79,00:03:24.94
Hey, guys.

00:03:28.03,00:03:29.94
-Well?[br]-How'd it go at the doctor's?

00:03:30.15,00:03:33.90
He said there's definitely[br]nothing to worry about. It's benign.

00:03:34.11,00:03:36.18
-What is it?[br]-He couldn't even tell me.

00:03:36.43,00:03:41.34
He said it was just[br]some sort of "skin abnormality. "

00:03:42.15,00:03:45.35
The worse thing is, he said,[br]being unable to identify it. . .

00:03:45.59,00:03:47.39
. . .he was reluctant to remove it.

00:03:47.63,00:03:48.98
You should go to my guy.

00:03:49.23,00:03:51.54
Because when I went in there[br]with my third nipple. . .

00:03:52.71,00:03:54.74
. . .he just lopped it right off.

00:03:55.07,00:03:56.74
So I guess I'm lucky.

00:03:56.99,00:04:00.95
I mean, not as lucky as people[br]who are born with two nipples.

00:04:01.55,00:04:05.34
At least they knew what yours was.[br]You know? Yours had a name.

00:04:06.23,00:04:08.54
Maybe they'll name yours after you.

00:04:09.23,00:04:11.34
You know?[br]They'd call it "The Ross. "

00:04:11.91,00:04:15.54
And then people would be, like,[br]"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

00:04:17.03,00:04:18.75
Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:04:20.79,00:04:22.35
Pete's breaking up with me.

00:04:22.59,00:04:23.38
What?

00:04:24.19,00:04:25.75
I just checked my messages.

00:04:25.99,00:04:29.11
He said that when he gets back,[br]"We need to talk. "

00:04:29.55,00:04:30.98
-And?[br]-Well, that's it.

00:04:31.19,00:04:34.42
People never say, "We need to talk,"[br]unless it's something bad.

00:04:34.63,00:04:37.35
That doesn't necessarily mean[br]he's breaking up with you.

00:04:37.99,00:04:38.78
Really?

00:04:38.99,00:04:41.02
Maybe he just cheated on you.

00:04:46.11,00:04:49.38
I won't get rich doing it,[br]but I gotta say, it's cool. . .

00:04:49.63,00:04:52.38
. . .knowing you're making[br]a difference in a kid's life.

00:04:52.63,00:04:54.54
That is so great.

00:04:55.91,00:04:57.14
Oh, my God!

00:04:57.59,00:04:58.86
Oh, my God!

00:04:59.11,00:05:00.86
We'd better call[br]the fire department.

00:05:02.03,00:05:03.98
Well, we don't need a fireman.

00:05:04.23,00:05:06.95
We need, like, a good mechanic.

00:05:08.23,00:05:10.87
Here they come![br]We gotta get out of here!

00:05:11.11,00:05:11.90
Wait. Why?

00:05:12.15,00:05:14.62
If I wanted to see a fireman,[br]I'd date one.

00:05:17.35,00:05:19.18
That's all it is.[br]A third nipple.

00:05:19.43,00:05:22.82
You know? Just your[br]run-of-the-mill third nipple.

00:05:23.03,00:05:26.38
You can take it off.[br]Just slice that baby right off.

00:05:26.63,00:05:29.59
Take your shirt off.[br]Let's see what we're dealing with.

00:05:32.23,00:05:33.74
What are you doing?

00:05:34.59,00:05:38.95
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,[br]slice-it-right-off third nipple.

00:05:39.15,00:05:41.58
Well, that's not a third nipple.

00:05:41.83,00:05:44.14
First of all, it's on your ass.

00:05:45.11,00:05:46.46
Well, then what is it?

00:05:47.03,00:05:48.75
Wait a minute. Hold it.

00:05:50.91,00:05:53.22
-Jansen, come in here.[br]-I'm with Hamilton!

00:05:53.83,00:05:56.14
He's good with weird things.[br]Bring him in too.

00:05:58.79,00:06:00.74
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

00:06:00.95,00:06:04.94
You know what? lf he's gonna break up[br]with me, maybe I won't water them.

00:06:05.19,00:06:08.78
If he's gonna break up with you,[br]maybe Joey and I should do it. . .

00:06:11.59,00:06:13.54
. . .if you know what I mean.

00:06:14.11,00:06:14.94
Or. . .

00:06:15.79,00:06:17.46
. . .we could go and pee on them.

00:06:20.55,00:06:22.19
I can't take it, you know.

00:06:22.43,00:06:25.18
I'm afraid one of them[br]will catch me with the other.

00:06:25.39,00:06:26.74
It's making me crazy!

00:06:26.99,00:06:28.94
Why don't you break up[br]with one of them?

00:06:30.35,00:06:33.47
What happened to playing the field?

00:06:33.71,00:06:35.82
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

00:06:36.03,00:06:38.94
It's feels like work.[br]It's like I'm working in the field.

00:06:39.95,00:06:41.38
So pick one of them.

00:06:41.59,00:06:42.70
Which one do you like more?

00:06:42.91,00:06:47.14
vince is great, you know?[br]Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

00:06:47.35,00:06:51.06
He's just so burly,[br]so very burly.

00:06:52.83,00:06:55.66
Okay, good. So there you go.[br]Go with vince.

00:06:55.91,00:06:57.42
But Jason's really sensitive.

00:06:57.63,00:06:59.46
Sensitive is important.[br]Pick him.

00:07:00.95,00:07:03.34
Oh, sure.[br]Go with the sissy.

00:07:04.83,00:07:06.94
Jason is not a sissy.

00:07:07.51,00:07:08.94
I meant Chandler.

00:07:19.55,00:07:22.19
You know, I have dinner plans.

00:07:23.39,00:07:26.78
Thank you so much for coming[br]on such a short notice.

00:07:27.03,00:07:31.78
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been[br]practicing medicine for 23 years. . .

00:07:32.03,00:07:33.35
. . .and I'm stumped.

00:07:45.23,00:07:46.46
Okay, this is the den.

00:07:46.71,00:07:48.94
All right, check this out.[br]Lights!

00:07:49.83,00:07:52.55
All right, less lights![br]Bad lights!

00:07:52.79,00:07:53.82
Lights, go away!

00:07:56.23,00:07:58.42
See? You just need the right command.

00:07:59.23,00:08:01.14
And the dimmer switch.

00:08:02.43,00:08:04.50
For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.

00:08:04.71,00:08:06.19
That's the video phone.

00:08:06.43,00:08:09.18
But you shouldn't be here.[br]So don't touch anything.

00:08:10.23,00:08:13.35
IKEA, this is comfortable!

00:08:14.31,00:08:16.34
This place is amazing!

00:08:16.55,00:08:19.22
-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.[br]-I know.

00:08:19.43,00:08:20.62
It's the nicest kitchen.

00:08:20.87,00:08:23.14
The refrigerator[br]told me to have a great day.

00:08:24.83,00:08:26.66
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

00:08:26.87,00:08:28.19
Joey, put that down.

00:08:29.83,00:08:31.74
Oh, my God, that's Pete.[br]Get out!

00:08:31.99,00:08:34.34
How the hell do you answer[br]a video phone?

00:08:37.63,00:08:39.03
I guess that's how.

00:08:39.43,00:08:41.15
Monica, how's it going?

00:08:41.35,00:08:43.54
Oh, it's good. It's good.

00:08:43.79,00:08:45.43
Just here, watering the plants.

00:08:45.63,00:08:47.66
Don't forget that ficus[br]there by Rachel.

00:08:50.27,00:08:51.59
Chandler's on the couch!

00:08:53.51,00:08:56.10
I see him. You guys[br]are the worst hiders, ever.

00:08:56.31,00:08:58.98
-Hi.[br]-How you doing?

00:09:01.03,00:09:03.75
The other day when you said[br]you needed to talk. . .

00:09:03.95,00:09:06.54
. . .just so I know,[br]is it good news or bad news?

00:09:06.79,00:09:09.06
It's good news.[br]It's definitely good news.

00:09:09.55,00:09:11.86
Hold on a second,[br]I have another call.

00:09:12.11,00:09:13.22
How's it going?

00:09:13.95,00:09:15.06
It's still me.

00:09:15.39,00:09:17.14
I've got picture-in-picture here.

00:09:19.43,00:09:22.34
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

00:09:22.99,00:09:25.55
Monica? You.[br]I'm gonna have to call you back.

00:09:26.11,00:09:27.62
So I'll see you soon.

00:09:27.95,00:09:29.75
-Okay. I love you.[br]-I love you.

00:09:29.99,00:09:32.14
We love you too!

00:09:34.67,00:09:36.78
Well, it's good news.[br]It's good news.

00:09:36.99,00:09:40.03
-What do you think the good news is?[br]-Look at this!

00:09:40.23,00:09:44.35
He wrote a check for $50,000[br]to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design. "

00:09:46.43,00:09:49.15
Sorry. What do you think[br]the good news is?

00:09:51.11,00:09:52.10
Oh, my!

00:09:52.31,00:09:54.11
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

00:09:54.79,00:09:57.86
You gotta get Mom on the phone![br]Call Mom! Call Mom!

00:10:00.55,00:10:02.19
And that's Pete's mom.

00:10:08.35,00:10:11.78
You have to make it a theme wedding.[br]And the theme could be:

00:10:11.99,00:10:13.98
"Look How Much Money We've Got! "

00:10:15.67,00:10:18.39
I mean, you could put money[br]in the invitations.

00:10:18.63,00:10:21.19
You could have, like,[br]little-money place settings.

00:10:21.39,00:10:23.86
And you could start[br]with a money salad.

00:10:24.11,00:10:26.94
I mean, it'll be dry,[br]but people will like it.

00:10:27.23,00:10:28.34
Would you stop?

00:10:28.55,00:10:30.14
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

00:10:30.35,00:10:31.75
We don't know if he'll propose.

00:10:31.99,00:10:34.18
But this is Pete.[br]He's not like other people.

00:10:34.43,00:10:36.18
On your first date, you went to Rome.

00:10:36.39,00:10:40.14
For most guys, that's like[br]a third or fourth date kind of thing.

00:10:41.43,00:10:43.99
Well, if that's what it is,[br]then it's crazy.

00:10:44.55,00:10:47.14
Monica's right.[br]We're talking about marriage here.

00:10:47.35,00:10:49.66
She can't just rush into this.

00:10:49.91,00:10:52.55
What do you know?[br]You married a lesbian!

00:10:58.31,00:11:00.66
I gotta go.[br]I have to break up with vince.

00:11:00.87,00:11:02.90
So you're going with the teacher?

00:11:03.11,00:11:06.74
I like vince a lot, you know?[br]But Jason is so sensitive.

00:11:06.95,00:11:10.22
In the long run, I think[br]sensitive is better than having. . .

00:11:10.43,00:11:13.94
. . .a really, really, really nice body.

00:11:17.43,00:11:19.54
Jason. Definitely Jason.

00:11:19.79,00:11:21.74
-Wish me luck![br]-Good luck!

00:11:24.19,00:11:25.38
Oh, my God!

00:11:28.15,00:11:28.94
Sorry.

00:11:29.19,00:11:32.39
I was imagining what it'd be like[br]to catch the money bouquet.

00:11:38.15,00:11:40.26
Excuse me. Is vince here?

00:11:40.51,00:11:41.54
Oh, sure.

00:11:46.11,00:11:48.58
I didn't know you guys[br]actually used those.

00:11:49.43,00:11:50.75
So what's up?

00:11:54.19,00:11:56.50
This isn't gonna be easy.

00:11:57.75,00:12:00.55
I don't think we should[br]see each other anymore.

00:12:03.43,00:12:04.58
Good deal.

00:12:05.95,00:12:06.78
I'm sorry.

00:12:07.03,00:12:07.90
No, it's okay.

00:12:08.83,00:12:12.79
It's just that I thought[br]we had something pretty special here.

00:12:13.03,00:12:16.94
I felt like you were someone[br]I could finally open up to.

00:12:17.15,00:12:20.35
There's so much in me[br]I haven't shared with you yet.

00:12:20.63,00:12:22.35
My God![br]I didn't know you were so--

00:12:22.55,00:12:24.35
I'm sorry. I can't talk.

00:12:26.23,00:12:28.38
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

00:12:31.79,00:12:33.02
Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:12:35.55,00:12:39.14
If you wanna take care of that thing,[br]go see my herbal guy.

00:12:39.71,00:12:42.75
Thanks. But I wanna remove it,[br]not make it savory.

00:12:44.99,00:12:48.46
When girls sleep with guys[br]with weird things on their body. . .

00:12:48.71,00:12:50.74
. . .they tell their friends about it.

00:12:51.51,00:12:52.74
Give me that.

00:12:55.63,00:12:59.42
Okay, don't be mad at me,[br]but I couldn't resist.

00:12:59.63,00:13:00.78
Bride's Magazines?

00:13:01.03,00:13:03.54
I know you said you'd say no[br]if he asked you. . .

00:13:03.75,00:13:06.74
. . .but how great would you look[br]walking down the aisle. . .

00:13:06.95,00:13:08.90
. . .in this Donna Karan?

00:13:09.59,00:13:11.54
You so would!

00:13:12.03,00:13:13.59
You should get that anyway.

00:13:15.71,00:13:17.19
Well, for clubbing.

00:13:18.31,00:13:19.54
It is so weird.

00:13:19.75,00:13:22.58
I know what I said.[br]But this morning. . .

00:13:22.83,00:13:26.14
. . .I was lying in bed, imagining[br]what it'd be like to say yes.

00:13:29.19,00:13:31.94
I know it's a little sudden,[br]and it's rushed. . .

00:13:32.19,00:13:34.70
. . .and it's not like me to do[br]something like this.

00:13:34.91,00:13:37.74
But it doesn't mean I can't.[br]Right?

00:13:37.95,00:13:39.59
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

00:13:39.83,00:13:42.55
And I know that[br]we want the same things.

00:13:42.79,00:13:44.94
And when I thought[br]about saying yes. . .

00:13:45.19,00:13:46.86
. . .it made me really happy.

00:13:47.07,00:13:48.34
Oh, my God!

00:13:50.11,00:13:51.18
I know.

00:13:52.11,00:13:52.94
I need more pie.

00:13:55.83,00:13:59.54
Mon, if you do get married,[br]can I bring two guests?

00:14:02.39,00:14:04.46
You didn't break up with that fireman?

00:14:04.71,00:14:06.27
That was my way of telling you.

00:14:07.31,00:14:09.66
Well, it turns out[br]he's incredibly sensitive.

00:14:09.91,00:14:11.98
He keeps a journal and he paints.

00:14:12.19,00:14:14.99
He even showed me charcoal drawings[br]that he drew of me.

00:14:15.23,00:14:19.43
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has[br]easy access to a lot of charcoal.

00:14:22.39,00:14:23.74
So will you dump Jason?

00:14:24.03,00:14:27.15
Yeah, because I have to break up[br]with someone.

00:14:27.35,00:14:31.18
So Jason is sensitive.[br]But now, so is vince.

00:14:31.39,00:14:33.46
Plus, vince has the body.[br]You know?

00:14:33.71,00:14:34.70
So. . . .

00:14:36.63,00:14:39.35
It's really just about the math.

00:14:46.59,00:14:48.15
Come on in.

00:14:56.31,00:14:58.14
You sounded serious on the phone.

00:14:58.39,00:15:00.14
Is anything wrong?

00:15:17.43,00:15:18.94
You must be Ross.

00:15:21.31,00:15:23.34
I am Guru Saj.

00:15:25.03,00:15:29.66
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never[br]been to a guru before, so. . . .

00:15:29.87,00:15:30.78
Well, relax.

00:15:31.03,00:15:33.46
If it makes you feel any better,[br]I've attended. . .

00:15:33.71,00:15:35.94
. . .fine medical schools[br]in Central America.

00:15:36.63,00:15:39.86
Well, let's take a look[br]at this skin abnormality of yours.

00:15:40.11,00:15:41.75
Come on, have a seat.

00:15:45.79,00:15:48.43
As I suspected, it's a kundus.

00:15:50.83,00:15:51.90
What's a "kundus"?

00:15:52.11,00:15:55.34
I don't know.[br]What's a kundus with you?

00:15:59.71,00:16:00.74
Please lie down.

00:16:01.15,00:16:04.74
I've got a salve that[br]ought to shrink that right up.

00:16:04.95,00:16:06.75
I guess it's worth a try.

00:16:06.95,00:16:08.59
Sure. We should see results--

00:16:09.19,00:16:11.34
Clearly not the way to go!

00:16:12.83,00:16:14.15
What? What?

00:16:14.39,00:16:16.46
We appear to have angered it.

00:16:16.95,00:16:18.78
We? We angered it?

00:16:20.99,00:16:22.94
I think I see the problem.

00:16:23.43,00:16:26.82
And I'm afraid we're gonna[br]have to use a much stronger tool.

00:16:28.55,00:16:29.62
Love.

00:16:30.99,00:16:32.06
Oh, God!

00:16:34.03,00:16:37.46
There is absolutely no way[br]this is gonna come off. . .

00:16:37.71,00:16:39.14
. . .unless you start to. . . .

00:16:39.79,00:16:41.54
What was that?

00:16:42.43,00:16:43.54
Well, it's gone.

00:16:45.23,00:16:46.10
How's that?

00:16:46.63,00:16:48.22
Got caught in my watch.

00:16:53.51,00:16:54.54
Lights.

00:16:55.95,00:16:57.54
Romantic lights.

00:16:59.03,00:16:59.98
Nice.

00:17:00.83,00:17:04.18
So there was this thing[br]I wanted to talk to you about.

00:17:04.55,00:17:08.14
Oh, right. I'd completely[br]forgot about that.

00:17:10.83,00:17:13.02
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

00:17:13.43,00:17:15.10
And I look at my life. . .

00:17:16.71,00:17:19.91
. . .and I feel like I've conquered[br]the business world.

00:17:20.83,00:17:23.63
And I feel like I've conquered[br]the intellectual world.

00:17:24.75,00:17:27.95
And now I have the most[br]beautiful woman in the world.

00:17:31.15,00:17:32.74
But there's one thing missing.

00:17:34.07,00:17:35.22
What's that?

00:17:36.79,00:17:39.62
It's time for me to conquer[br]the physical world.

00:17:46.31,00:17:47.95
I wanna become. . .

00:17:48.63,00:17:50.94
. . .the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:17:52.11,00:17:53.43
You wanna what?

00:17:54.55,00:17:56.58
I wanna be[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:17:56.83,00:17:59.55
It's the most intense[br]physical competition in the world.

00:17:59.75,00:18:01.10
It's banned in 49 states.

00:18:01.71,00:18:03.43
What are you talking about?

00:18:03.67,00:18:05.55
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me. . .

00:18:05.75,00:18:07.90
. . .Jeet Kune Do[br]and Brazilian streetfighting.

00:18:08.11,00:18:11.18
I even had my own[br]octagon training ring designed.

00:18:11.43,00:18:14.31
And I suppose you used[br]a ring designer for that.

00:18:17.43,00:18:20.15
I want you there,[br]in the front row, when I win.

00:18:20.35,00:18:22.74
I want you close enough[br]to smell the blood.

00:18:24.71,00:18:25.94
What do you think?

00:18:27.51,00:18:29.54
My parents will be so happy.

00:18:34.71,00:18:37.46
Crazy underwear[br]Creeping up my butt

00:18:39.59,00:18:42.79
Crazy underwear[br]Always in a rut

00:18:43.03,00:18:45.22
Crazy underwear

00:18:48.43,00:18:50.07
What is he doing here?

00:18:50.31,00:18:52.22
All right, just keep playing.

00:18:52.43,00:18:54.94
You'll get through this.[br]You'll be fine.

00:19:04.39,00:19:05.95
Okay, thank you.

00:19:06.95,00:19:10.42
And as always, no one talk to me[br]after the show.

00:19:15.35,00:19:17.38
I was passing by[br]and saw you were playing.

00:19:17.63,00:19:19.82
This is cool, seeing you up there.

00:19:22.95,00:19:24.98
What's going on here?[br]Who's this guy?

00:19:25.99,00:19:29.34
I don't know! He just started[br]kissing me. Get him, vince!

00:19:31.23,00:19:32.50
What?

00:19:33.63,00:19:35.86
I've been dating both of you.

00:19:37.19,00:19:40.15
And it's been really horrible,[br]because it's been. . .

00:19:40.39,00:19:42.19
. . .a lot of fun for me.

00:19:45.15,00:19:48.03
But I like you both. . .

00:19:48.27,00:19:50.38
. . .and I didn't know how to choose.

00:19:50.67,00:19:54.30
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.[br]I'm a terrible person.

00:19:55.35,00:19:57.78
Relax. It's okay.[br]I mean. . . .

00:19:58.03,00:20:00.26
We never said this was exclusive.

00:20:00.51,00:20:03.07
Neither did we.[br]So give yourself a break.

00:20:04.11,00:20:05.14
Really?

00:20:06.27,00:20:08.38
We haven't been going out that long.

00:20:08.63,00:20:11.19
Come on, we haven't even[br]slept together yet.

00:20:11.95,00:20:13.35
You haven't?

00:20:15.99,00:20:16.78
You have?

00:20:16.99,00:20:19.14
Well, this is none of my business.

00:20:21.87,00:20:24.83
I can't believe this![br]You slept with him?

00:20:25.11,00:20:27.75
Well, I made you[br]a candlelight dinner in the park.

00:20:29.79,00:20:32.75
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

00:20:38.31,00:20:40.54
That could've been really awkward.

00:20:43.55,00:20:46.54
You made him a candlelight dinner[br]in the park?

00:20:46.83,00:20:50.10
Yeah, but I can do that for you.[br]I'm gonna do that for you.

00:20:50.31,00:20:52.74
I can't believe[br]I went out with somebody. . .

00:20:52.99,00:20:56.34
. . .who'd have an open flame[br]in the middle of a wooded area!

00:21:05.19,00:21:07.54
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:21:08.63,00:21:10.14
Okay, Dick?

00:21:13.03,00:21:14.86
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

00:21:18.23,00:21:20.54
He's a duck, right?[br]Because otherwise. . .

00:21:20.79,00:21:22.74
. . .this is way out of my league.

00:21:23.67,00:21:27.46
He's got a really bad cough,[br]and our vet can't stop it.

00:21:27.67,00:21:29.34
Is there something you can do?

00:21:29.79,00:21:31.19
Let me see.

00:21:31.99,00:21:33.58
Let me see.

00:21:35.55,00:21:38.14
Do you think you could get him[br]to eat a bat?

Are you still on hold?

I was supposed to call my dad back[br]two hours ago.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Call him as soon as you get a chance.[br]He's at Flimbees.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's Flimbees?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That's the word I use when[br]I can't remember the real thing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, hang up! That's it. Come on!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No. That's what they want me to do.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My warranty expires tomorrow.[br]If I don't get through. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .they won't fix my crappy,[br]broken phone for free!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We cannot let them win![br]It's us versus them!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yes!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I gotta double-check for tickets[br]tonight. Who got what?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I have one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My boyfriend.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I have a boyfriend now.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Two it is. How about you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, I also need two.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Really? Who's number two?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Whose Number Two? One of the more[br]difficult games sewer workers play.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, it's just this person.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Like a date-type person?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, kind of.[br]It's this woman from work.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I hope that won't be too weird.[br]Will it, Rach?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Not at all. I was actually[br]gonna bring someone myself.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But you said one ticket.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I meant me plus one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay. Did you guys mean you plus one?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right. I'll see you tonight.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Bye-bye.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, I need a date!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, hey! You guys are finally[br]gonna get to meet Kate!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I borrowed your cologne.[br]I hope she likes it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you doing?[br]She's seeing somebody.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

-Here you go. You can wear this.[br]-Thanks.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm setting the phone down.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But I'm still here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Just don't go anywhere.[br]I'm still here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Don't switch or anything, because[br]I'm right here. Just one sec.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
One sec. One second!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait! One second! Just. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What? Monica, I'm scared!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Honey, that's a sleeve.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And we also have a speakerphone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is important to us.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You gotta hang up.[br]We'll be late.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yes! Yes! I'm the next caller!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You were gonna have me hang up.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Can you take a duck and a chick[br]to the theater?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Of course not.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I just wanted them to hear it[br]from somebody else.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, hi, how are you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Good.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Looks like we're the first ones here.[br]-Looks that way.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
First ones here!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.[br]Ross, Tommy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin.[br]Cailin--

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And break!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I think I'm gonna run[br]to the ladies' room.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-I'll join you.[br]-I'll get our seats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, this is. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .awkward.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, because Rachel and I[br]used to go out.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, then this is awkward.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-So what do you. . .?[br]-I think we're here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I think you may be in our seats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, I don't think so.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Could we take a look at your ticket?[br]-Sure.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" . . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, well, I thought that--

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You thought? Well, that didn't[br]really work out for you. Idiot!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you, a moron?[br]It says, "D-1 3" ! Okay?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're surrounded by even numbers![br]Does that give you a clue?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-The usher told me--[br]-The usher must be right!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
With all his training!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Get out!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Here!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?[br]-No, I'm good.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-There he is![br]-There's our star!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You were great!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So? What'd you think?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Almost as good as the play with[br]the two naked girls on the seesaw.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-I wasn't in that.[br]-I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I want you to meet everybody.[br]Everybody, this is Kate.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Excuse me. Excuse me.[br]Sweetheart!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So that's the girl you like.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I tell you, this guy[br]Rachel is with is crazy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He viciously screamed at total[br]strangers. I think he's bad news.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait a minute. You don't like[br]the guy Rachel's dating?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, that's odd.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, hey, Lauren. You guys, this is[br]Kate's understudy, Lauren.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I ran into you in the hallway[br]in your building.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It was right after I slept with Joey.[br]He dumped me the next day.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So how'd you guys meet?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The short version is, I pursued[br]her for a couple of months.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Then I gave her a check for $20,000[br]and she was mine.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
In the long version, I dump him[br]for telling people the short version.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How do you do?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Do they have representation?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
They weren't in the play.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We're not actors.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What a shame!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
With her face and her chest,[br]I could really put something together.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Could I borrow it?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hi. Remember me?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hi. Yeah. Tommy's in line[br]for the bathroom. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and someone just cut.[br]I think he's gonna snap.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna go.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Go? Why?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't know. Could be[br]because I don't feel like. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .waiting all night for a guy[br]who may or may not scream.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He definitely will scream.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Goodbye.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Here we go, people!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
"Boxing Day.

Joey Tribbiani gives[br]an uneven performance.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst[br]thing in this production. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yes!

Thank you, boys and girls.

You've ruined my life.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Please stuff your talentless faces. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Excuse me!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Does anyone mind if I save this?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Is the play over?[br]-Where were you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thank you for your patience.[br]You're the next caller.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You were "the next caller" hours ago.[br]You must be going crazy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've kept myself busy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in[br]her room and her stuff in your room.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You okay?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Fabulous.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Drama critics, they're nothing but[br]people who couldn't make it as actors.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-You know what to do?[br]-Become a drama critic.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I am hurt!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
A plague. . .

. . .on both your houses!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
By the way, he dumped me tonight[br]after he read my review.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, classy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I sure know how to pick them.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know I gave up a part[br]on a soap for this?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I gave up a job too.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Really? What?[br]-Declawing cats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, tell you what,[br]let me walk you home.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn[br]every copy of The Times and The Post.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Why The Post?[br]-You didn't see The Post?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-No. You?[br]-No. Why?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You really think these newspapers[br]are just jealous of me?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Absolutely. You're talented[br]and you're good-looking.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're sweet and cute.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know. That's why they trashed me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Wait. Wait a minute.[br]-What?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't get you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, first you hate me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Then you sleep with me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Then you want nothing to do with me.[br]Now you want me again?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You never went out[br]with an actress before?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Kate, do you even like me?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Of course I do.[br]-So how come you blew me off?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-How come you were with him?[br]-I don't know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I just do this.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I always have to pick, like,[br]the smartest guy. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .or the most talented guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Why can't I just[br]pick someone like you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thanks.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know what I mean.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're just so. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're so. . .

Good night.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sweet dreams.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna put this can right here[br]in case you have to hurl.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Please stay on the line.[br]Your call is very important to us.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You've been up for 24 hours.[br]Go to sleep.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This isn't healthy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, no, I'm fine.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And you know why?[br]Because of all the riboflavin.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Didn't you have that on last night?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I stayed at Kate's[br]but nothing happened.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, where were you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm so, so sorry.[br]I am definitely gonna see your play.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I swear, your play is very important[br]to us. Thank you for your patience.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Your play is the next play[br]I'm gonna see.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How'd it go with Kate?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It was great!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I walked her home, and it was[br]amazing how much we connected.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Then she passed out.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But then she woke up.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And we stayed up all night talking.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And now we're crazy about each other!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You had "the night" !

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
When two people realize[br]their feelings for each other. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and they talk for hours and learn[br]all about the other person.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You think?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Did you learn about her family?[br]-Two brothers. One died!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yes!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This is from the woman at the bar.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry. She thought[br]you were somebody else.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-What time is it?[br]-One.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
7: 1 5.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Watch doesn't work.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.[br]We're going to lunch.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Look, I wasn't gonna[br]say anything to you, but. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right, I don't think[br]you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You don't?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.[br]I think you should stay away from him.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Or maybe I should stay away[br]from all men.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's not just because I'm jealous.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, I'm not. I'm not jealous.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Look, the guy actually screamed[br]at this couple sitting in our seats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, and at the end of the play. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .he got up, and he just started,[br]like, banging his hands together.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You don't want to believe me,[br]that's fine.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We're kidding.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No one believe me.[br]I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Sorry, Tommy.[br]-What's in the cup?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What is in the cup?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, it's coffee.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Iced coffee?[br]Tell me it's iced coffee.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-It's hot--[br]-Hot coffee!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You idiot! You gonna spill[br]hot coffee all over me, huh?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you? Just a big, stupid[br]doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's your favorite thing[br]about summertime?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Going to the beach[br]when it stays light real late.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's your favorite thing[br]about summer?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't know. Probably the smell[br]of freshly cut grass.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That's a good one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry! Sorry I'm late! My duck and[br]my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We held the curtain for you.[br]Let's go!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
vic! Where have you been, baby?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Where's Kate?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
She got a job in L.A.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've been waiting up all night[br]for you. Where have you been?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Where have you been, vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Go to the window. I wanna run down[br]to the truck and show you something.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What do you got down there, vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What do you got under that tarp?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
When is she leaving?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Tonight. What are you doing?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm coming up!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Use ours across the hall[br]because she. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .has problems.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thanks.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry, Tommy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I almost spilled this[br]hot coffee on you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, but you didn't.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, but. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .it's hot.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Would you stop it?[br]It's getting really old.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I can't believe no one believes me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I do. I believe you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You do?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah. But I also believed her[br]when she said I was next.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey there, little fella.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Gross!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Idiot!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
"Oh, look at me! I'm so cute![br]I'm a little chick who's disgusting! "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're so stupid![br]How are you not yet extinct?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you quacking about?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Dumb Donald Dodo!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Step away from the duck.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I guess we're not going out anymore.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Man!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.[br]I couldn't find you before.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's all this about L.A.?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
They still want me[br]for General Hospital.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .what about us?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Last night was wonderful.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But I can't stay here just for you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So stay for the museums.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-I'm sorry.[br]-Joey, on-stage!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
At least stay till the end[br]of the play.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'll go to the airport with you.[br]I want to say goodbye.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Where are you, vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Flight's in an hour.[br]I gotta go.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
vic?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-vic![br]-In a minute!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So this is it, victor?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah. I guess it is.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Listen. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say[br]it quick because this is killing me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
One thing you gotta know[br]is that I will never forget you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But you got things[br]you have to do now.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And so do l.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And so. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .I'm gonna get on[br]this spaceship. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7[br]in search of alternative fuels.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But when I return[br]200 years from now. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .you'll be long gone. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .but I won't have aged at all.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So you tell your great,[br]great granddaughter. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .to look me up.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Because, Adrianne. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .baby. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .I'm gonna want to meet her.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So long, vic!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's been two days.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Good thing it's one of those[br]801 numbers, right?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Phoebe, 800 is toll free.[br]801 is Utah.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It has to be 800 because all those[br]big companies have 800 numbers.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Every. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, every big Utah-based company[br]has one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry. I'm so sorry.[br]I will pay you back.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And yet she's still not[br]hanging up the phone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Hang up![br]-Hang up the phone!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Fine! Fine!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, I think I broke it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But that's all right.[br]Here's the number where you can call.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck[br]and our chick had a baby?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We could call it Chuck.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Or Dick.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Listen, I need a favor.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I was in the shower,[br]and as I was. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .cleansing myself, I felt something.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No. I mean, like,[br]a thing on my body.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, what was it?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, I don't know.[br]It's kind of in a place that's not. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's not visually accessible to me.[br]And I was hoping maybe you guys. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .could help me out.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come on, you guys![br]It's no big deal!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, what is it?[br]ls it a mole?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Is it--?[br]What, a pimple?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, it's. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .fancier than a pimple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Ross, just go see a doc--[br]-Guys, what's--?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, it's definite.[br]Two more weeks of winter.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, right.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00

Fire safety is not a joke, son.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You're right. I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Look, I gotta go.[br]I'm on call tonight.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
See you Saturday.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's cute, Pheebs.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But you just started dating[br]that teacher.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, Jason?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We're seeing each other tonight.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, Pheebs?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Two dates in one day?[br]That's so unlike you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know, I know.[br]I'm, like, playing the field.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm juggling two guys.[br]I'm sowing my wild oats.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know, this kind of, like,[br]oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So do they know about each other?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Does a dog's lips move[br]when he reads?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, no, they don't know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hey, guys.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Well?[br]-How'd it go at the doctor's?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He said there's definitely[br]nothing to worry about. It's benign.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-What is it?[br]-He couldn't even tell me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He said it was just[br]some sort of "skin abnormality. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The worse thing is, he said,[br]being unable to identify it. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .he was reluctant to remove it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You should go to my guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Because when I went in there[br]with my third nipple. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .he just lopped it right off.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So I guess I'm lucky.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, not as lucky as people[br]who are born with two nipples.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
At least they knew what yours was.[br]You know? Yours had a name.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Maybe they'll name yours after you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know?[br]They'd call it "The Ross. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And then people would be, like,[br]"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Pete's breaking up with me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I just checked my messages.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He said that when he gets back,[br]"We need to talk. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-And?[br]-Well, that's it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
People never say, "We need to talk,"[br]unless it's something bad.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That doesn't necessarily mean[br]he's breaking up with you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Really?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Maybe he just cheated on you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I won't get rich doing it,[br]but I gotta say, it's cool. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .knowing you're making[br]a difference in a kid's life.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That is so great.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We'd better call[br]the fire department.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, we don't need a fireman.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We need, like, a good mechanic.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Here they come![br]We gotta get out of here!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait. Why?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
If I wanted to see a fireman,[br]I'd date one.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That's all it is.[br]A third nipple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know? Just your[br]run-of-the-mill third nipple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You can take it off.[br]Just slice that baby right off.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Take your shirt off.[br]Let's see what we're dealing with.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you doing?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,[br]slice-it-right-off third nipple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, that's not a third nipple.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
First of all, it's on your ass.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, then what is it?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait a minute. Hold it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Jansen, come in here.[br]-I'm with Hamilton!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's good with weird things.[br]Bring him in too.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know what? lf he's gonna break up[br]with me, maybe I won't water them.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
If he's gonna break up with you,[br]maybe Joey and I should do it. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .if you know what I mean.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Or. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .we could go and pee on them.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I can't take it, you know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm afraid one of them[br]will catch me with the other.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's making me crazy!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Why don't you break up[br]with one of them?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What happened to playing the field?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's feels like work.[br]It's like I'm working in the field.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So pick one of them.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Which one do you like more?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
vince is great, you know?[br]Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's just so burly,[br]so very burly.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, good. So there you go.[br]Go with vince.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But Jason's really sensitive.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sensitive is important.[br]Pick him.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, sure.[br]Go with the sissy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Jason is not a sissy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I meant Chandler.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You know, I have dinner plans.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thank you so much for coming[br]on such a short notice.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been[br]practicing medicine for 23 years. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and I'm stumped.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, this is the den.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right, check this out.[br]Lights!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right, less lights![br]Bad lights!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Lights, go away!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
See? You just need the right command.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And the dimmer switch.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That's the video phone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But you shouldn't be here.[br]So don't touch anything.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
IKEA, this is comfortable!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This place is amazing!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.[br]-I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's the nicest kitchen.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The refrigerator[br]told me to have a great day.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Joey, put that down.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God, that's Pete.[br]Get out!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How the hell do you answer[br]a video phone?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I guess that's how.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Monica, how's it going?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, it's good. It's good.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Just here, watering the plants.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Don't forget that ficus[br]there by Rachel.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Chandler's on the couch!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I see him. You guys[br]are the worst hiders, ever.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Hi.[br]-How you doing?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
The other day when you said[br]you needed to talk. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .just so I know,[br]is it good news or bad news?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's good news.[br]It's definitely good news.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hold on a second,[br]I have another call.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How's it going?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's still me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've got picture-in-picture here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Monica? You.[br]I'm gonna have to call you back.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So I'll see you soon.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Okay. I love you.[br]-I love you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We love you too!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, it's good news.[br]It's good news.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-What do you think the good news is?[br]-Look at this!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He wrote a check for $50,000[br]to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design. "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry. What do you think[br]the good news is?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You gotta get Mom on the phone![br]Call Mom! Call Mom!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And that's Pete's mom.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You have to make it a theme wedding.[br]And the theme could be:

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
"Look How Much Money We've Got! "

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, you could put money[br]in the invitations.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You could have, like,[br]little-money place settings.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And you could start[br]with a money salad.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, it'll be dry,[br]but people will like it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Would you stop?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We don't know if he'll propose.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But this is Pete.[br]He's not like other people.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
On your first date, you went to Rome.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
For most guys, that's like[br]a third or fourth date kind of thing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, if that's what it is,[br]then it's crazy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Monica's right.[br]We're talking about marriage here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
She can't just rush into this.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What do you know?[br]You married a lesbian!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I gotta go.[br]I have to break up with vince.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So you're going with the teacher?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I like vince a lot, you know?[br]But Jason is so sensitive.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
In the long run, I think[br]sensitive is better than having. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .a really, really, really nice body.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Jason. Definitely Jason.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
-Wish me luck![br]-Good luck!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sorry.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I was imagining what it'd be like[br]to catch the money bouquet.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Excuse me. Is vince here?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, sure.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I didn't know you guys[br]actually used those.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So what's up?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This isn't gonna be easy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't think we should[br]see each other anymore.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Good deal.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm sorry.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
No, it's okay.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's just that I thought[br]we had something pretty special here.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I felt like you were someone[br]I could finally open up to.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
There's so much in me[br]I haven't shared with you yet.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My God![br]I didn't know you were so--

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm sorry. I can't talk.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
If you wanna take care of that thing,[br]go see my herbal guy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Thanks. But I wanna remove it,[br]not make it savory.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
When girls sleep with guys[br]with weird things on their body. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .they tell their friends about it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Give me that.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, don't be mad at me,[br]but I couldn't resist.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Bride's Magazines?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know you said you'd say no[br]if he asked you. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .but how great would you look[br]walking down the aisle. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .in this Donna Karan?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You so would!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You should get that anyway.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, for clubbing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It is so weird.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know what I said.[br]But this morning. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .I was lying in bed, imagining[br]what it'd be like to say yes.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know it's a little sudden,[br]and it's rushed. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and it's not like me to do[br]something like this.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But it doesn't mean I can't.[br]Right?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I know that[br]we want the same things.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And when I thought[br]about saying yes. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .it made me really happy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, my God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I know.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I need more pie.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Mon, if you do get married,[br]can I bring two guests?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You didn't break up with that fireman?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That was my way of telling you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, it turns out[br]he's incredibly sensitive.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He keeps a journal and he paints.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He even showed me charcoal drawings[br]that he drew of me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has[br]easy access to a lot of charcoal.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So will you dump Jason?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, because I have to break up[br]with someone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So Jason is sensitive.[br]But now, so is vince.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Plus, vince has the body.[br]You know?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's really just about the math.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come on in.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You sounded serious on the phone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Is anything wrong?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You must be Ross.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I am Guru Saj.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never[br]been to a guru before, so. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, relax.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
If it makes you feel any better,[br]I've attended. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .fine medical schools[br]in Central America.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, let's take a look[br]at this skin abnormality of yours.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come on, have a seat.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
As I suspected, it's a kundus.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's a "kundus"?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't know.[br]What's a kundus with you?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Please lie down.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've got a salve that[br]ought to shrink that right up.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I guess it's worth a try.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Sure. We should see results--

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Clearly not the way to go!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What? What?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We appear to have angered it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We? We angered it?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I think I see the problem.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I'm afraid we're gonna[br]have to use a much stronger tool.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Love.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, God!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
There is absolutely no way[br]this is gonna come off. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .unless you start to. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What was that?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, it's gone.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
How's that?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Got caught in my watch.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Lights.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Romantic lights.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Nice.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So there was this thing[br]I wanted to talk to you about.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Oh, right. I'd completely[br]forgot about that.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I look at my life. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and I feel like I've conquered[br]the business world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I feel like I've conquered[br]the intellectual world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And now I have the most[br]beautiful woman in the world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But there's one thing missing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's that?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's time for me to conquer[br]the physical world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I wanna become. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You wanna what?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I wanna be[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's the most intense[br]physical competition in the world.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
It's banned in 49 states.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What are you talking about?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .Jeet Kune Do[br]and Brazilian streetfighting.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I even had my own[br]octagon training ring designed.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And I suppose you used[br]a ring designer for that.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I want you there,[br]in the front row, when I win.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I want you close enough[br]to smell the blood.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What do you think?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
My parents will be so happy.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Crazy underwear[br]Creeping up my butt

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Crazy underwear[br]Always in a rut

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Crazy underwear

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What is he doing here?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
All right, just keep playing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You'll get through this.[br]You'll be fine.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, thank you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And as always, no one talk to me[br]after the show.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I was passing by[br]and saw you were playing.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
This is cool, seeing you up there.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What's going on here?[br]Who's this guy?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I don't know! He just started[br]kissing me. Get him, vince!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
What?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I've been dating both of you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
And it's been really horrible,[br]because it's been. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .a lot of fun for me.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
But I like you both. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .and I didn't know how to choose.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.[br]I'm a terrible person.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Relax. It's okay.[br]I mean. . . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We never said this was exclusive.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Neither did we.[br]So give yourself a break.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Really?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
We haven't been going out that long.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Come on, we haven't even[br]slept together yet.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You haven't?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You have?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, this is none of my business.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I can't believe this![br]You slept with him?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Well, I made you[br]a candlelight dinner in the park.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
That could've been really awkward.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
You made him a candlelight dinner[br]in the park?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Yeah, but I can do that for you.[br]I'm gonna do that for you.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
I can't believe[br]I went out with somebody. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .who'd have an open flame[br]in the middle of a wooded area!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Okay, Dick?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's a duck, right?[br]Because otherwise. . .

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
. . .this is way out of my league.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
He's got a really bad cough,[br]and our vet can't stop it.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Is there something you can do?

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Let me see.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Let me see.

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.00
Do you think you could get him[br]to eat a bat?

00:00:03.62,00:00:06.89
Do you think there's a town[br]in Missouri or someplace. . .

00:00:07.14,00:00:08.46
. . .called Sample?

00:00:08.66,00:00:12.45
And as you' re driving into the town,[br]there's a sign and it says:

00:00:12.70,00:00:14.61
"You' re in Sample. "

00:00:18.70,00:00:20.65
-How did it go with Pete?[br]-Tell us.

00:00:20.86,00:00:23.05
You' re not gonna believe this.[br]So I go--

00:00:23.30,00:00:25.21
I' m sorry. Excuse us.

00:00:28.34,00:00:31.09
-It's a little crowded. Do you mind?[br]-Could you skooch?

00:00:31.54,00:00:33.13
Move over just a little bit.

00:00:34.50,00:00:35.73
Keep on skooching.

00:00:37.26,00:00:40.61
So, guys, listen.[br]I go over there and, you know, I' m--

00:00:40.82,00:00:42.73
Why? What is wrong with me?

00:00:42.98,00:00:44.73
-What's the matter?[br]-Tim. . .

00:00:44.98,00:00:46.65
. . .I have a feeling. . .

00:00:46.86,00:00:50.45
. . .my wife is sleeping[br]with her gynecologist.

00:00:53.14,00:00:54.29
How do you know?

00:00:54.54,00:00:56.02
-He's got access.[br]-I know.

00:00:58.06,00:00:59.49
It's a feeling you get.

00:00:59.74,00:01:01.85
Like when you' re in[br]somebody else's bowling shoes?

00:01:02.10,00:01:03.05
That's the one.

00:01:04.62,00:01:06.89
-So you went to Pete's.[br]-What happened?

00:01:07.14,00:01:09.33
Why is this happening to me?

00:01:09.58,00:01:11.09
Maybe it's my wound.

00:01:11.54,00:01:12.33
Forget it.

00:01:14.18,00:01:15.53
It's not healed yet?

00:01:15.78,00:01:17.10
It's oozing!

00:01:17.54,00:01:19.89
Would you pass the cream?[br]There's the cream.

00:01:20.14,00:01:21.46
Thank you very much.

00:01:22.50,00:01:26.25
Tomas, this is gonna be hard,[br]but I wanted it to come from me.

00:01:26.46,00:01:29.05
-What is it?[br]-I've been sleeping with your wife.

00:01:29.30,00:01:30.29
You' re the gynecologist?

00:01:30.54,00:01:33.13
I' m trying to have[br]a private conversation.

00:01:34.86,00:01:37.58
Can I have a napkin?[br]Could you please hand me a napkin?

00:01:37.82,00:01:40.09
Just give me the thing, all right?

00:01:41.54,00:01:42.33
Enough!

00:01:42.58,00:01:44.85
And you are no longer my friend!

00:01:45.06,00:01:46.97
We are finished! Nada! No more!

00:01:47.22,00:01:49.09
You are a bastard for doing that!

00:01:49.34,00:01:50.74
Stay away from me!

00:01:51.54,00:01:52.49
Come back!

00:02:00.54,00:02:03.26
So what were you gonna tell us?

00:02:04.22,00:02:05.33
I have no idea.

00:02:07.50,00:02:09.61
The One With[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion

00:02:10.90,00:02:11.89
English Subtitles by[br]GELULA & CO., INC.

00:02:54.38,00:02:56.89
What was the big news[br]Pete wanted to tell you?

00:02:57.14,00:02:59.25
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?

00:03:00.02,00:03:02.25
Oh, keep your name.[br]Don't take his name.

00:03:02.54,00:03:04.57
He didn't ask me to marry him.

00:03:04.78,00:03:07.09
Then definitely don't take his name!

00:03:08.54,00:03:11.85
He wanted to tell me he's going[br]to compete in some Ultimate. . .

00:03:12.06,00:03:13.78
. . .Fighting Competition thingy.

00:03:13.98,00:03:16.25
-Pete?[br]-Why? What is it?

00:03:16.50,00:03:18.97
I don't know exactly.[br]It's sort of like wrestling.

00:03:20.26,00:03:22.05
But without the costumes.

00:03:23.30,00:03:25.33
And it's not fake.[br]It's totally brutal.

00:03:25.58,00:03:29.62
It's two guys in the ring and[br]the rules are, "There are no rules" !

00:03:30.46,00:03:32.89
You can bite and pull[br]people's hair and stuff?

00:03:33.14,00:03:36.25
Anything goes except eye-gouging[br]and fish-hooking.

00:03:36.46,00:03:38.81
-What's fish-hooking?[br]-What's fish-hook--

00:03:41.34,00:03:44.17
Thanks. That would have been[br]hard to describe.

00:03:44.54,00:03:45.97
What is that taste?

00:03:46.62,00:03:50.05
My hands are totally clean.[br]I just gave the duck a bath.

00:03:53.74,00:03:55.22
Thanks for the warm welcome.

00:03:55.50,00:03:59.70
It's good to have you guys on my team.[br]I come to play. I hope you do too.

00:03:59.94,00:04:02.29
Let's go out there and get them![br]And remember:

00:04:02.54,00:04:04.97
There is no "I" in "team. "

00:04:05.22,00:04:09.05
Yes, but there's two in "martini. "[br]So, everybody, back to my office.

00:04:10.02,00:04:12.74
You! Chuckles. What's your name?

00:04:12.98,00:04:14.97
It's Bing, sir.[br]I' m sorry. I was just. . . .

00:04:15.22,00:04:18.45
No, no. I heard what you said.[br]Funny. I like funny.

00:04:18.74,00:04:21.49
This team's about hard work,[br]but it's also about having fun.

00:04:21.74,00:04:23.65
Good to have you aboard, Bing!

00:04:30.58,00:04:32.01
That's right. Ryder.

00:04:32.70,00:04:34.97
Winona Ryder for six.

00:04:37.50,00:04:38.41
Thank you.

00:04:38.62,00:04:40.81
Yeah. We have the reservations.

00:04:41.54,00:04:43.45
All right, buddy! Way to go!

00:04:46.02,00:04:47.34
Dude, what are you doing?

00:04:47.94,00:04:52.17
Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my[br]butt, and acting like it's no big deal.

00:04:52.38,00:04:53.86
What'd you do about it?

00:04:54.06,00:04:56.70
I didn't do anything.[br]I didn't want to be the guy. . .

00:04:56.94,00:04:59.66
. . .who has a problem with his boss[br]slapping his bottom.

00:05:00.50,00:05:03.65
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay[br]to be that guy.

00:05:04.66,00:05:06.06
Maybe it's that jock thing.

00:05:06.26,00:05:09.85
You know, how football players[br]pat each other after touchdowns.

00:05:12.06,00:05:14.09
You know, I don't understand guys.

00:05:14.34,00:05:17.65
I mean, I would never congratulate[br]Monica on a great stew. . .

00:05:17.86,00:05:20.01
. . .by, you know, grabbing her boob.

00:05:21.74,00:05:23.89
I know. For a really great stew,[br]you'd just. . .

00:05:24.14,00:05:25.86
. . .stick your head in between them.

00:05:27.50,00:05:28.85
Can we please go eat?

00:05:29.10,00:05:32.06
-Yeah, what are we getting?[br]-Anything but stew.

00:05:33.02,00:05:36.37
So from now on, don't give[br]your boss a chance to get you.

00:05:36.62,00:05:38.26
Don't turn your back to him.

00:05:38.86,00:05:41.29
Or you could teach him[br]a lesson, you know?

00:05:41.54,00:05:45.93
What you do is rub something that[br]smells really bad on your butt, right?

00:05:46.14,00:05:49.37
Then, when he goes to smack you,[br]his hand will smell.

00:05:52.10,00:05:55.53
Now, what could you rub on your butt[br]that would smell bad?

00:05:58.42,00:06:00.33
What if Joey was President?

00:06:03.62,00:06:04.94
Can I ask you something?

00:06:05.62,00:06:07.29
Okay, you can totally say no. . .

00:06:07.50,00:06:11.38
. . .but would it be okay with you[br]if I set Ross up on a date?

00:06:13.54,00:06:14.33
With who?

00:06:14.58,00:06:17.30
My friend Bonnie.[br]She always thought Ross was cute. . .

00:06:17.54,00:06:20.05
. . .and she asked if I could set it up.

00:06:20.26,00:06:22.85
-But if that's not cool. . . .[br]-Which one is Bonnie?

00:06:23.10,00:06:25.45
You remember her from[br]my birthday party?

00:06:25.70,00:06:27.73
Average height. . .

00:06:27.98,00:06:30.09
. . .medium build, bald. . . .

00:06:33.82,00:06:35.17
That's fine.

00:06:35.78,00:06:38.85
Great! Okay! Good for you![br]All right!

00:06:44.26,00:06:46.98
You are iron! You are steel!

00:06:47.66,00:06:51.05
Let me ask you, how come when I call[br]your computer support line. . .

00:06:51.26,00:06:53.25
. . .I have to wait an hour and a half?

00:06:53.50,00:06:56.85
We' re adding operators all the time.[br]Could we concentrate on my training?

00:06:57.06,00:07:00.33
It's just hard when I know[br]I have e-mail I can't get.

00:07:06.22,00:07:07.05
Hi, honey.

00:07:07.26,00:07:09.33
On the table. On the table, please.

00:07:12.74,00:07:15.85
So listen, my friends were[br]telling me a little bit about. . .

00:07:16.06,00:07:17.78
. . .this Ultimate Fighting thing.

00:07:18.02,00:07:19.89
It sounds really dangerous.

00:07:20.14,00:07:23.10
I don't want you to get hurt[br]because I kind of like you.

00:07:23.30,00:07:26.57
I don't want to get hurt either.[br]I' m being smart about this.

00:07:26.82,00:07:29.70
See these guys? They' re[br]the best trainers in the world.

00:07:29.94,00:07:32.66
And Hoshi here used to be[br]a paid assassin.

00:07:33.42,00:07:35.89
A house painter![br]He used to be a house painter!

00:07:38.34,00:07:41.06
-Promise me you'll be careful.[br]-I promise.

00:07:41.26,00:07:44.14
Are we still on for tonight?[br]Good. Because. . .

00:07:44.34,00:07:46.98
. . .maybe we could have[br]a little workout of our own.

00:07:47.22,00:07:48.86
No boom-boom before big fight!

00:07:53.66,00:07:54.93
How about just a boom?

00:07:59.42,00:08:01.65
That was depressing.[br]I just bought a pretzel. . .

00:08:01.86,00:08:03.85
. . .from one of the kids from Fame.

00:08:04.70,00:08:07.61
Ready to go to the movies?[br]Oh, this is Bonnie!

00:08:09.82,00:08:10.93
This is Bonnie?

00:08:11.18,00:08:13.05
This is Bonnie? You' re Bonnie?

00:08:13.26,00:08:16.06
I can show you an l.D. if you want.

00:08:16.26,00:08:20.14
Oh, no. You look a lot different[br]than the last time I saw you.

00:08:20.38,00:08:23.13
Oh, yeah. Well, I just[br]started wearing bras again.

00:08:23.90,00:08:25.57
Oh, that must be it.

00:08:27.06,00:08:28.25
Have fun tonight.

00:08:28.46,00:08:29.61
Thanks. You too.

00:08:36.10,00:08:37.29
You said she was bald.

00:08:37.54,00:08:39.26
She was bald. She's not now.

00:08:41.26,00:08:43.05
How could you not tell me[br]she has hair?

00:08:43.30,00:08:46.05
I don't know.[br]I hardly ever say that about people.

00:08:46.30,00:08:48.05
Oh, well this is just perfect!

00:08:48.70,00:08:51.53
Well, I' m sorry.[br]I thought you said it was okay.

00:08:51.78,00:08:56.06
I said it was okay when I thought[br]she was some weird bald chick.

00:08:56.26,00:08:58.69
That girl has got hair[br]all over her head!

00:09:01.06,00:09:05.05
-Maybe Ross won't like her personality.[br]-Does she have a bad personality?

00:09:05.26,00:09:07.25
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!

00:09:12.74,00:09:13.53
Bing!

00:09:15.66,00:09:18.49
Read your CompuTek proposal.[br]Real home run.

00:09:19.86,00:09:22.50
Barely got you that time.[br]Get over here!

00:09:23.34,00:09:24.13
Come on.

00:09:24.74,00:09:26.25
Oh, yeah! Good one.

00:09:26.50,00:09:28.93
That was a good one.[br]Keep at it, team!

00:09:30.46,00:09:32.10
-What is with him?[br]-"With him"?

00:09:32.34,00:09:34.65
You' re his favorite.[br]You' re his guy!

00:09:34.86,00:09:36.21
We never get smacked.

00:09:37.74,00:09:39.73
That's not true.[br]He smacked you once.

00:09:39.98,00:09:42.97
Not on purpose.[br]He ricocheted off you and got me.

00:09:43.30,00:09:46.18
I' m telling you,[br]I need some smacks.

00:09:46.74,00:09:48.57
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.

00:09:48.82,00:09:51.46
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth?[br]Dartmouth sucks!

00:09:51.66,00:09:53.09
-You go to Dartmouth?[br]-No, sir.

00:09:53.34,00:09:54.82
There you go!

00:10:02.94,00:10:04.45
God, Ross! What is that?

00:10:04.70,00:10:06.26
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.

00:10:06.46,00:10:09.42
I saved 30 cents.[br]Plus, I get to keep the cup.

00:10:11.66,00:10:13.89
From New York City, New York. . .

00:10:14.14,00:10:18.10
. . .appearing in his Ultimate[br]Fighting Championship debut. . .

00:10:18.34,00:10:21.93
. . .he's known for his[br]confrontational business style!

00:10:23.06,00:10:26.37
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing. . .

00:10:26.58,00:10:28.97
. . .Pete Becker!

00:10:34.38,00:10:35.73
I love you, Pete!

00:10:39.66,00:10:43.54
And his opponent,[br]from Huntington Beach, California. . .

00:10:43.78,00:10:47.37
. . .he's a 300-pound[br]streetfighter. . .

00:10:47.86,00:10:50.17
. . .Tank Abbott!

00:11:02.50,00:11:03.29
Pete?

00:11:03.54,00:11:04.33
Pete?

00:11:04.70,00:11:06.85
-That guy's pretty huge.[br]-Don't worry.

00:11:07.10,00:11:09.45
I'll use his strength[br]and weight against him.

00:11:09.70,00:11:13.77
Well, then that guy is in serious,[br]serious trouble.

00:11:18.66,00:11:20.38
You go get him. Let's go!

00:11:21.66,00:11:23.30
Here we go, gentlemen.

00:11:23.54,00:11:24.81
Are you ready?

00:11:27.82,00:11:30.25
Are you ready?[br]Then let's get it on!

00:11:51.62,00:11:52.73
It's me.

00:11:53.62,00:11:55.26
Monica.

00:11:57.94,00:12:00.45
Can I just tell you how proud[br]I am of you?

00:12:00.66,00:12:04.49
It would be nice after hearing[br]20,000 people chant, "You suck! "

00:12:05.66,00:12:07.57
I thought you were nuts at first. . .

00:12:07.82,00:12:09.30
. . .but you did it.

00:12:09.66,00:12:12.57
Now you can just look back at this[br]with no regrets.

00:12:12.82,00:12:14.17
Look back?

00:12:14.94,00:12:16.73
You' re not gonna keep going?

00:12:17.10,00:12:20.65
Let me ask you a question:[br]Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?

00:12:22.66,00:12:24.30
Well, no. But--

00:12:24.54,00:12:27.69
I' m not gonna stop until I' m[br]the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:12:28.74,00:12:32.37
That guy stood on your neck[br]until you passed out.

00:12:33.14,00:12:34.78
Let me tell you a story.

00:12:35.62,00:12:39.77
When I set out to create MOSS 865,[br]do you think it happened overnight?

00:12:40.02,00:12:44.25
No. There was MOSS 1[br]that burned down my dad's garage.

00:12:44.50,00:12:48.25
There was MOSS 2 that would only[br]schedule appointments in January.

00:12:48.46,00:12:50.69
And 862 others that I learned from.

00:12:50.94,00:12:54.53
Just like I learned from this fight,[br]never to let a guy stand on my neck.

00:12:54.78,00:12:56.93
You didn't know that already?

00:12:58.34,00:13:00.29
Look, I' m gonna get better.

00:13:01.10,00:13:03.09
Okay? I promise you.

00:13:06.66,00:13:08.93
Just get a lot better.

00:13:09.34,00:13:10.66
Fast.

00:13:12.74,00:13:13.77
One other thing.

00:13:14.02,00:13:17.57
Hoshi thinks you being ringside[br]may have affected my concentration.

00:13:19.74,00:13:21.41
That was the problem.

00:13:27.74,00:13:30.49
-How long until Pete's fight?[br]-About five minutes.

00:13:30.74,00:13:32.38
They' re interviewing his opponent.

00:13:32.62,00:13:36.53
Apparently, he trains by going to lran[br]and pulling the arms off thieves.

00:13:37.86,00:13:39.93
-Hot dog?[br]-Four, please.

00:13:40.50,00:13:42.06
I' m really nervous.

00:13:42.94,00:13:43.97
Thank you.

00:13:46.14,00:13:49.13
So how did it go with Bonnie?

00:13:49.38,00:13:53.37
Oh, I gotta tell you,[br]I wasn't expecting to like her at all.

00:13:53.62,00:13:56.45
I actually wasn't expecting[br]to like anyone right now.

00:13:56.66,00:13:58.61
But she's really terrific.

00:13:58.90,00:13:59.77
It's too bad.

00:14:02.14,00:14:04.45
No, I' m saying I liked her.

00:14:04.70,00:14:06.53
There are other fish in the sea.

00:14:07.70,00:14:10.85
I think she's great, okay?[br]We' re going out again.

00:14:11.42,00:14:14.49
I hear you. Are you capable[br]of talking about anything else?

00:14:16.30,00:14:18.21
Which one's my turkey burger?

00:14:18.46,00:14:20.61
The one next to my foot.[br]Sorry.

00:14:21.54,00:14:23.69
-Fight's starting![br]-We'll be right in.

00:14:23.90,00:14:26.65
So did your boss try[br]to slap you again today?

00:14:26.86,00:14:28.26
Nine times.

00:14:29.06,00:14:30.62
I had to put on lotion.

00:14:32.70,00:14:35.50
But it'll be okay.[br]Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.

00:14:35.74,00:14:39.53
And if all goes as planned,[br]my butt will be smack-free.

00:14:40.22,00:14:41.33
Fight's over!

00:14:46.70,00:14:48.10
Excuse me, Doug?

00:14:50.42,00:14:52.37
Hey there, sports fan!

00:14:52.74,00:14:55.09
Bing! You got those numbers for me?

00:14:55.30,00:14:57.13
No. I didn't do them.

00:14:57.38,00:14:59.17
You forgot?

00:14:59.42,00:15:01.77
No, I just didn't do them.

00:15:02.02,00:15:05.57
Instead, I hung out with some[br]friends and had a couple of beers.

00:15:05.82,00:15:08.38
So I certainly don't[br]deserve praise. verbal. . .

00:15:08.62,00:15:10.13
. . .or otherwise.

00:15:10.74,00:15:13.70
I got tanked myself last night.[br]Pretty dicey drive home.

00:15:13.94,00:15:16.29
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.

00:15:17.30,00:15:20.33
That's okay. You' re still[br]my number-one guy! Bing!

00:15:20.94,00:15:22.42
Doug!

00:15:23.30,00:15:27.58
I' m a little bit uncomfortable with[br]the way that you express yourself.

00:15:27.82,00:15:30.25
Is it the swearing?[br]ls it the constant swearing?

00:15:30.46,00:15:34.29
Because I gotta tell you, if it is,[br]you can just kiss my ass!

00:15:36.30,00:15:38.89
It's not about the swearing.[br]It's more about. . .

00:15:39.14,00:15:41.49
. . .the way that you occasionally. . .

00:15:41.74,00:15:45.09
. . .concentrate your enthusiasm. . .

00:15:46.30,00:15:47.78
. . .on my buttocks.

00:15:50.14,00:15:52.94
Don't get me wrong.[br]I appreciate the sentiment.

00:15:53.14,00:15:56.81
It's just that I have a rather[br]sensitive posterior.

00:15:58.58,00:16:01.73
And besides, it's making[br]all the other guys jealous.

00:16:01.94,00:16:05.77
Well, say no more. You know,[br]it takes guts to bring this up.

00:16:06.02,00:16:07.89
Bing, you' re okay.

00:16:17.74,00:16:21.17
Would you rather live in the[br]shirt pocket of a sweaty giant. . .

00:16:21.42,00:16:23.81
. . .or inside his shower drain?

00:16:25.74,00:16:26.93
Oh, my God.

00:16:27.50,00:16:29.45
Look. It's Ross and that girl.

00:16:32.66,00:16:36.97
Look at that! It's a line of ants![br]They' re working as a team!

00:16:38.90,00:16:42.86
Right. Oh, yeah. It looks[br]like Ross is breaking up with her.

00:16:43.10,00:16:44.50
I hope he lets her down easy.

00:16:44.74,00:16:47.57
Look at that! They are not[br]breaking up! Look at them!

00:16:47.82,00:16:50.70
You know what that is?[br]A second date, that's what that is.

00:16:51.30,00:16:53.53
Look, she just put her hand[br]on his thigh.

00:16:53.78,00:16:56.25
That's nothing.[br]She's very sexually aggressive.

00:16:56.46,00:16:57.49
Oh, God!

00:16:57.74,00:17:02.33
It's your fault. Now he loves her.[br]He'll marry her. It's all your fault.

00:17:03.02,00:17:04.45
You said it was okay.

00:17:04.70,00:17:06.73
You said she was bald!

00:17:08.14,00:17:10.37
Was! Was, was, was!

00:17:11.62,00:17:15.45
We can't let it happen. We have to do[br]something. We have to break them up.

00:17:15.70,00:17:19.74
Just go in there and shave her head![br]You owe me one bald girl!

00:17:21.50,00:17:23.22
Okay, first of all, breathe.

00:17:24.42,00:17:26.69
Second of all, I don't get it.

00:17:27.02,00:17:29.98
Aren't you the one that decided[br]you didn't want to be with Ross?

00:17:33.30,00:17:36.85
Well, isn't he your friend?[br]Don't you want him to be happy?

00:17:40.90,00:17:42.01
So?

00:17:46.10,00:17:50.41
It's just, you know, I didn't[br]expect him to be this happy so soon.

00:17:59.82,00:18:00.69
-Oh, no.[br]-What?

00:18:00.94,00:18:01.97
We killed them all!

00:18:17.54,00:18:20.29
It's not as bad as it looks.[br]It's a precaution.

00:18:20.54,00:18:22.93
I' m not supposed to move my spine.

00:18:25.34,00:18:27.13
Please tell me you' re stopping now.

00:18:27.50,00:18:30.14
I' m fine. I'd fight tonight[br]if they'd let me.

00:18:31.74,00:18:34.25
Now, see this circle[br]I' m marking off here?

00:18:34.46,00:18:36.37
This is my Zone of Terror.

00:18:39.02,00:18:42.25
You are insane![br]You've got to give this up!

00:18:42.46,00:18:45.26
I can't until I' m[br]the Ultimate Fighter.

00:18:45.46,00:18:46.57
I will do it.

00:18:46.82,00:18:50.89
The day will come when children will[br]argue over who will win a fight. . .

00:18:51.14,00:18:52.97
. . .me or Superman.

00:18:54.78,00:18:57.66
Not that I could beat Superman,[br]but kids are stupid.

00:18:58.86,00:19:00.05
Just sit down.

00:19:00.26,00:19:02.05
Please listen to me.

00:19:02.26,00:19:07.05
You are terrible at this, okay? You[br]are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.

00:19:07.54,00:19:08.45
Ever!

00:19:09.82,00:19:13.70
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline[br]fracture in my right forearm. . .

00:19:13.94,00:19:17.90
. . .and a severely bruised Adam's[br]apple, but that really hurt.

00:19:23.30,00:19:25.45
Well, then, you know what?

00:19:27.42,00:19:31.41
I care about you too much to watch you[br]hurt yourself like this.

00:19:31.90,00:19:35.17
So if you have to do this,[br]you'll have to do it without me.

00:19:35.66,00:19:37.49
If you' re asking me to quit. . .

00:19:37.74,00:19:40.46
. . .then you' re asking me[br]to be someone I' m not.

00:19:40.74,00:19:42.14
I've got to do this.

00:19:46.30,00:19:48.05
Then I've gotta go.

00:19:49.86,00:19:50.73
Bye.

00:19:58.74,00:20:00.77
Could you leave a note?[br]I' m on painkillers. . .

00:20:01.02,00:20:03.05
. . .and I might not[br]remember this tomorrow.

00:20:08.30,00:20:13.09
So, in conclusion, the lines[br]all go up, so I' m happy.

00:20:13.94,00:20:16.17
Great job, team![br]Tomorrow at 8:30.

00:20:16.74,00:20:19.70
Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!

00:20:19.90,00:20:22.05
Goldberg, you maniac!

00:20:22.26,00:20:23.77
I love you!

00:20:26.94,00:20:29.58
-Couldn't have done it without you.[br]-Thank you, sir.

00:20:29.82,00:20:31.05
Oh, excuse me.

00:20:31.26,00:20:34.85
I forgot my briefcase, you know,[br]by accident.

00:20:35.10,00:20:38.45
Of course, you did. Forgot[br]something else too, you bastard!

00:20:41.06,00:20:43.05
Well, what about you?

00:20:43.30,00:20:45.65
You' re not feeling left out, are you?

00:20:46.94,00:20:49.45
No, not at all. That's ridiculous.

00:20:49.66,00:20:52.77
Everybody else got one,[br]and you want one too. Don't you?

00:20:55.98,00:20:57.21
Yes, I do.

00:20:57.50,00:20:59.53
Now, get on out of here, you!

00:21:04.62,00:21:06.26
Pete Becker circles the ring.

00:21:06.50,00:21:08.85
Looks like he's just trying[br]to feel him out.

00:21:09.06,00:21:10.49
Bruiser is charging!

00:21:10.74,00:21:13.30
Run, you crazy, rich freak!

00:21:14.90,00:21:16.13
I can't watch this.

00:21:16.38,00:21:17.94
Check it out! Pete's winning!

00:21:18.18,00:21:19.25
Really?

00:21:22.54,00:21:26.74
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas[br]and is going for his favorite area!

00:21:28.46,00:21:32.25
Wait! lf that's his favorite area,[br]why is he being so mean to it?

00:21:32.90,00:21:34.09
This is ironic.

00:21:34.34,00:21:36.90
Your last boyfriend, Richard,[br]didn't want to have kids.

00:21:37.14,00:21:39.65
And from the looks of it,[br]now Pete can't.

00:21:54.69,00:21:58.52
So your first sexual experience[br]was with a woman?

00:21:59.33,00:22:01.84
I was 1 5.[br]It was my best friend, Ruth.

00:22:02.05,00:22:04.36
And we got drunk on that hard cider.

00:22:04.61,00:22:07.25
And then suddenly,[br]we were making out.

00:22:08.41,00:22:09.24
Tell it again.

00:22:12.81,00:22:13.60
Seriously.

00:22:16.61,00:22:19.07
Can that woman talk[br]about anything else but sex?

00:22:20.49,00:22:24.24
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was[br]talking about geography.

00:22:25.13,00:22:28.44
She was listing the countries[br]she's done it in.

00:22:30.25,00:22:32.08
I think we all[br]learned something.

00:22:33.65,00:22:35.76
Hey, you guys! Look what I found!

00:22:36.01,00:22:37.88
That's my mom's writing. Look.

00:22:38.33,00:22:41.84
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,[br]graduation, 1 965. "

00:22:42.05,00:22:45.32
-Do you know what that means?[br]-That you're actually 50?

00:22:46.05,00:22:48.69
That's not "me" Phoebe.[br]That's her pal, Phoebe.

00:22:48.93,00:22:51.20
According to her yearbook,[br]they were BFF.

00:22:52.81,00:22:54.00
Best Friends Forever.

00:22:54.93,00:22:55.96
That's great!

00:22:56.21,00:23:00.20
I know! She probably has all kinds[br]of stories about my parents.

00:23:00.41,00:23:02.08
She might know where my dad is.

00:23:02.29,00:23:04.28
I looked her up.[br]She lives by the beach.

00:23:04.53,00:23:06.56
Maybe this weekend we can[br]go there.

00:23:07.81,00:23:10.76
-Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.[br]-That's too bad.

00:23:11.45,00:23:13.00
Big fat bummer.

00:23:14.53,00:23:16.84
So tomorrow we'll drive out[br]to Montauk.

00:23:17.05,00:23:18.92
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

00:23:21.25,00:23:23.40
The One At the Beach

00:23:24.61,00:23:25.60
English Subtitles by[br]GELULA & CO., INC.

00:24:11.61,00:24:13.04
Would you look at them?

00:24:14.13,00:24:16.16
I'm never gonna find[br]a boyfriend again.

00:24:16.41,00:24:18.64
I'm gonna die an old maid.

00:24:18.89,00:24:21.04
You're not gonna die an old maid.

00:24:21.25,00:24:23.71
Maybe an old spinster cook.

00:24:26.61,00:24:29.28
-Thanks.[br]-Besides, worse comes to worse. . .

00:24:29.49,00:24:31.24
. . .I'll be your boyfriend.

00:24:34.45,00:24:35.44
Yeah, right.

00:24:38.61,00:24:40.32
Why is that so funny?

00:24:40.57,00:24:42.48
You made a joke, right?

00:24:42.73,00:24:44.21
So I laughed.

00:24:46.73,00:24:48.16
A little too hard.

00:24:49.53,00:24:51.28
Am I not boyfriend material?

00:24:53.09,00:24:54.00
You're Chandler.

00:24:56.01,00:24:58.24
You know. Chandler!

00:24:58.69,00:25:01.60
Okay, so we've established[br]my name, and hit me.

00:25:02.49,00:25:05.08
But say we weren't friends.[br]Say it's a blind date.

00:25:05.33,00:25:09.68
I show up at your door and I'm,[br]like, "Hey, nice to meet you. "

00:25:11.21,00:25:15.04
I'd probably be scared of a guy[br]using a fake voice.

00:25:16.33,00:25:17.92
Oh, good. You bought food.

00:25:18.17,00:25:20.04
No, just my luggage.

00:25:27.13,00:25:29.36
I am having the best karma this week.

00:25:29.57,00:25:31.48
I find this woman[br]who knew my parents. . .

00:25:31.73,00:25:34.64
. . .and then my client[br]gives me his beach house.

00:25:34.85,00:25:37.49
What about that bike[br]messenger you hit?

00:25:37.73,00:25:40.00
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

00:25:42.01,00:25:43.84
Hey, check out the hat!

00:25:47.09,00:25:48.92
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

00:25:49.61,00:25:51.09
I was taken aboard that hat.

00:25:52.65,00:25:54.52
They did experiments on me.

00:25:54.73,00:25:56.05
I can't have children!

00:25:57.41,00:25:59.44
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

00:25:59.69,00:26:00.84
Ross gave it to me.

00:26:01.09,00:26:03.16
I think she looks good.

00:26:04.25,00:26:05.76
Did he buy it for you. . .

00:26:06.25,00:26:07.52
. . .or win it for you?

00:26:09.01,00:26:11.28
Excuse me,[br]my fashion-impaired friends. . .

00:26:11.53,00:26:13.44
. . .I'm here to tell you[br]hats are back.

00:26:13.69,00:26:17.24
And this time, they've ganged up[br]and formed one giant super-hat.

00:26:23.37,00:26:24.16
Go, go, go!

00:26:24.37,00:26:26.48
Now everybody wants to be[br]under the hat!

00:26:33.93,00:26:35.48
What's with all this sand?

00:26:35.73,00:26:38.16
Bob said there might be flood damage.

00:26:38.41,00:26:40.52
Either that or he has[br]a really big cat.

00:26:45.37,00:26:47.16
It's kind of an unusual house.

00:26:47.41,00:26:51.04
It has three beautiful bedrooms[br]and no baths.

00:26:51.37,00:26:54.24
But, you know, the ocean[br]is right there.

00:26:55.01,00:26:56.04
Knock, knock, knock.

00:26:56.53,00:26:58.36
Hang on.[br]Come in, come in.

00:26:58.61,00:27:00.52
Think about it and call me back.

00:27:02.29,00:27:03.48
Are you Phoebe Abbott?

00:27:04.61,00:27:07.80
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott![br]I'm your best friend's daughter!

00:27:10.13,00:27:11.35
You're lrwin's daughter?

00:27:11.61,00:27:14.28
I mean your old best friend.[br]Here.

00:27:15.01,00:27:18.84
-Lily? From high school? Remember?[br]-Oh, God, Lily. Yes.

00:27:19.05,00:27:21.00
Of course I remember Lily.

00:27:22.89,00:27:23.72
Then you must be--

00:27:23.97,00:27:25.29
Phoebe, Phoebe.

00:27:26.93,00:27:29.12
She named me after you, I guess.

00:27:29.53,00:27:32.09
Wow. Well.[br]Look, there's Frank!

00:27:32.29,00:27:33.88
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!

00:27:34.13,00:27:36.24
That's my dad. That's Frank!

00:27:36.45,00:27:38.84
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

00:27:39.45,00:27:41.68
Take it easy.[br]If you want, there's cookies.

00:27:41.93,00:27:44.65
Or sangria! I could make sangria!

00:27:44.89,00:27:46.80
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

00:27:49.53,00:27:53.00
Anyway, I've been[br]looking for my father.

00:27:54.01,00:27:57.44
-Have you heard from him or seen him?[br]-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:27:57.65,00:28:00.84
I lost track of everybody[br]after high school.

00:28:03.41,00:28:07.04
Well, so tell me everything[br]about my parents. Everything.

00:28:07.25,00:28:10.28
Oh, well, you know,[br]we were always together.

00:28:10.53,00:28:13.84
-The other kids had a nickname for us.[br]-What was it?

00:28:14.05,00:28:15.48
The Three Losers.

00:28:16.33,00:28:17.65
Oh, poor Lily.

00:28:19.65,00:28:23.64
I heard what happened. That must[br]have been just terrible for you. . .

00:28:23.89,00:28:25.68
. . .Iosing your mother that way.

00:28:26.85,00:28:28.48
Yeah, no, it was great.

00:28:39.61,00:28:42.12
You know what a really good[br]rainy-day game is?

00:28:42.37,00:28:44.04
I mean, naked game.

00:28:45.05,00:28:46.84
We should play strip poker.

00:28:47.29,00:28:48.24
Are you crazy?

00:28:48.49,00:28:52.20
Come on. When you go away,[br]you have to play. It's, like, a law.

00:28:53.61,00:28:55.16
-All done.[br]-Thank you.

00:28:55.41,00:28:57.12
Okay. Who's next?

00:29:01.73,00:29:02.95
No way!

00:29:03.17,00:29:07.16
Come on, please. I'm bored.[br]You let me do it once before.

00:29:11.33,00:29:14.44
Well, if that's the rule[br]this weekend. . . .

00:29:16.33,00:29:19.12
-Get away.[br]-Take it like a man. Come on!

00:29:21.01,00:29:22.00
Big bullies!

00:29:35.49,00:29:36.64
How are we doing?

00:29:36.89,00:29:38.44
Bored and bored.

00:29:39.93,00:29:42.88
You know what naked card game's[br]never boring?

00:29:45.25,00:29:46.84
So what's Phoebe like?

00:29:47.13,00:29:50.24
I'm kind, caring and sweet.[br]What's Monica like?

00:29:51.73,00:29:54.08
No, the other Phoebe.[br]The one you went to see?

00:29:54.33,00:29:56.89
I think she knows where my dad is!

00:29:57.09,00:29:57.96
Cool!

00:29:58.21,00:29:59.00
Where is he?

00:29:59.21,00:30:02.04
She was pretending she hasn't[br]heard from him. . .

00:30:02.29,00:30:04.28
. . .but I found this picture.

00:30:04.53,00:30:06.84
Isn't this what he would[br]look like now?

00:30:07.61,00:30:08.44
Totally familiar.

00:30:11.97,00:30:13.08
Why would she lie to you?

00:30:13.33,00:30:16.44
We're having dinner tomorrow.[br]Maybe she'll tell me then.

00:30:16.65,00:30:18.88
Maybe she just wanted[br]to give him time. . .

00:30:19.13,00:30:21.04
. . .to buy me presents.[br]I don't know.

00:30:22.37,00:30:24.04
So you're all bored?

00:30:25.09,00:30:28.36
I'll close my eyes and point[br]to someone. Whoever it is. . .

00:30:28.61,00:30:31.84
. . .has to think of something[br]fun to do. And we have to do it.

00:30:32.09,00:30:33.80
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

00:30:37.49,00:30:39.52
You know, we could just do this!

00:30:43.65,00:30:45.72
We all have to play strip poker?

00:30:49.09,00:30:50.44
Strip Happy Days Game?

00:30:51.45,00:30:56.36
I couldn't find cards, so it was this[br]or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

00:30:57.33,00:30:58.36
Done.

00:31:00.41,00:31:05.04
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.[br]Collect two cool points. "

00:31:06.33,00:31:09.72
Get five points, you get to make[br]someone take off one item of clothing.

00:31:09.97,00:31:12.43
It hasn't happened yet,[br]but we're very excited.

00:31:13.53,00:31:14.72
Okay, come on.

00:31:15.25,00:31:20.16
Daddy needs a new electromagnetic[br]microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.

00:31:25.41,00:31:29.52
"Take Pinky Tuscadero up[br]to lnspiration Point.

00:31:29.77,00:31:31.84
Collect three cool points. " Yeah!

00:31:32.05,00:31:33.68
Which gives me five.

00:31:33.93,00:31:36.57
And let's see, who is gonna lose[br]their clothes?

00:31:37.69,00:31:41.00
I think I pick our strip poker[br]sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

00:31:44.57,00:31:46.68
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

00:31:49.29,00:31:53.44
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.[br]Collect three cool points. "

00:31:53.69,00:31:58.44
Which means I have five and[br]that means I get Joey's boxers.

00:32:04.53,00:32:06.04
Fine. Gang up on me.

00:32:06.29,00:32:08.93
I got you all,[br]right where I want you.

00:32:09.41,00:32:11.08
Come on! Take them off!

00:32:11.33,00:32:12.84
Actually, it's kind of cold.

00:32:13.05,00:32:16.40
What if I keep them on and[br]give you a peek at the good stuff?

00:32:16.89,00:32:18.88
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

00:32:19.13,00:32:21.96
What are you doing?[br]Trying to get me drunk?

00:32:22.25,00:32:24.40
I'm just making margaritas.

00:32:25.69,00:32:27.20
Think I'll help her out.

00:32:30.89,00:32:32.11
What is going on here?

00:32:32.33,00:32:33.24
What?

00:32:33.49,00:32:36.84
You're painting his toenails.[br]Chasing him around the room.

00:32:37.05,00:32:38.04
Monica, please.

00:32:38.29,00:32:40.24
He's totally flirting with you too.

00:32:41.33,00:32:42.55
He is, isn't he?

00:32:44.13,00:32:48.09
I don't know. Maybe it's just[br]being here at the beach together. . .

00:32:48.33,00:32:49.73
. . .but it's like something--

00:32:55.21,00:32:56.00
Hi, Bonnie.

00:32:57.21,00:32:59.85
My boss let me off early,[br]so I took the train.

00:33:00.05,00:33:01.32
What are you guys doing?

00:33:01.57,00:33:03.96
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

00:33:05.01,00:33:06.52
Cool! I'll catch up!

00:33:15.65,00:33:18.32
So you still don't think. . .

00:33:18.61,00:33:20.24
. . .I'm boyfriend material?

00:33:22.29,00:33:25.28
I saw you checking me out[br]during the game last night.

00:33:25.73,00:33:27.64
You didn't even take off your pants.

00:33:27.89,00:33:28.72
Lucky for you.

00:33:30.65,00:33:32.20
-What?[br]-I don't know.

00:33:33.81,00:33:37.72
Well, is everybody else having[br]just the best time?

00:33:39.01,00:33:40.16
Joey's asleep.

00:33:49.73,00:33:52.84
He passed out. We put sand[br]around him to keep him warm.

00:33:55.73,00:33:59.08
Well, I assume the happy couple[br]isn't up yet?

00:33:59.33,00:34:01.52
Did you guys hear them last night?

00:34:01.81,00:34:05.96
I don't know what they were doing,[br]but sea turtles came up to the house.

00:34:08.33,00:34:09.44
Good morning.

00:34:10.33,00:34:11.65
-How'd you sleep?[br]-Great.

00:34:11.89,00:34:12.68
Like a log.

00:34:12.93,00:34:14.20
Us too.

00:34:16.21,00:34:17.24
I'm going for a walk.

00:34:22.69,00:34:25.48
Good morning.[br]Nice breasts by the way.

00:34:35.89,00:34:37.44
Hey, what happened to you?

00:34:37.65,00:34:40.92
Oh, nothing. I just felt like[br]hanging out and reading.

00:34:41.53,00:34:45.57
The water was so great. We jumped[br]off this pier and my suit came off.

00:34:47.09,00:34:48.44
Sorry I missed that.

00:34:48.65,00:34:50.72
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

00:34:53.01,00:34:55.24
I brought back half the beach[br]in my hair.

00:34:55.49,00:34:57.48
It was easier when I shaved my head.

00:35:02.25,00:35:04.24
You know, I gotta tell you. . .

00:35:04.45,00:35:07.28
. . .I just loved your look[br]when you were bald.

00:35:07.93,00:35:09.12
Really?

00:35:09.93,00:35:12.49
I think about shaving it[br]again sometimes.

00:35:13.05,00:35:14.16
Really?

00:35:15.21,00:35:16.80
You definitely should do that.

00:35:17.93,00:35:19.84
You know what? I should do it!

00:35:20.09,00:35:22.68
You know what? Thank you.[br]You are so cool.

00:35:22.93,00:35:24.72
Oh, stop. Go on.

00:35:25.25,00:35:27.64
-Now go shave that head.[br]-All right.

00:35:38.73,00:35:40.05
What's the matter?

00:35:40.25,00:35:42.89
She canceled.[br]My namesake canceled on me.

00:35:43.13,00:35:46.44
She claims she had to go out of town.[br]She's avoiding me.

00:35:46.69,00:35:50.04
She doesn't want to tell me[br]where my father is. She knows!

00:35:50.29,00:35:52.32
Pheebs, that sucks.

00:35:53.45,00:35:56.24
Well, don't[br]"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

00:35:57.25,00:35:59.64
-Where are you going?[br]-She's out of town.

00:35:59.89,00:36:02.48
Something in her house[br]will tell me where he is.

00:36:02.85,00:36:05.84
Some people call that[br]"breaking and entering. "

00:36:06.29,00:36:08.64
Well, are any of those people here?

00:36:09.89,00:36:12.20
Look, I'll do something nice, okay?

00:36:13.45,00:36:15.44
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

00:36:17.37,00:36:18.32
Hey, everybody!

00:36:23.93,00:36:25.08
Look what you did!

00:36:26.85,00:36:27.96
You wanna touch it?

00:36:28.17,00:36:30.12
No, but it's great.

00:36:30.37,00:36:31.88
Come on, touch it.

00:36:36.01,00:36:38.92
You can feel all the bones[br]in your skull.

00:36:47.29,00:36:51.36
I was having a little chat[br]with Bonnie, and guess what?

00:36:51.61,00:36:54.72
She brought up who was[br]behind the head-shaving idea.

00:36:54.97,00:36:57.64
And now, who was it?[br]Oh, that's right. It was you!

00:36:59.41,00:37:01.28
That was her idea.

00:37:01.53,00:37:04.20
I just gave her a nudge.

00:37:04.45,00:37:06.64
She said you gave her the razor.

00:37:09.21,00:37:11.24
So anyone up for a midnight dip?

00:37:11.49,00:37:13.48
-No, I'm good.[br]-No, thanks.

00:37:13.73,00:37:16.64
-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.[br]-Okay, have fun.

00:37:17.93,00:37:21.04
Come on, see?[br]She doesn't look that bad.

00:37:21.81,00:37:24.88
You can see the moonlight[br]bouncing off her head!

00:37:26.41,00:37:27.68
What were you thinking?

00:37:27.93,00:37:29.08
I don't know.

00:37:29.33,00:37:30.92
You balded my girlfriend!

00:37:31.17,00:37:32.12
All right.

00:37:34.21,00:37:37.32
Do you think it's easy for me[br]to see you with somebody else?

00:37:37.57,00:37:39.48
You're the one who ended it!

00:37:39.73,00:37:43.56
Because I was mad at you![br]Not because I stopped loving you!

00:37:44.69,00:37:45.84
You still love me?

00:37:49.33,00:37:50.24
You still love me.

00:37:51.29,00:37:52.28
Yeah, so?

00:37:52.53,00:37:53.52
You love me.

00:37:58.69,00:38:00.04
What does this mean?

00:38:00.25,00:38:02.89
I mean, do you want[br]to get back together?

00:38:03.13,00:38:04.88
No! Maybe!

00:38:05.73,00:38:07.21
I don't know.

00:38:12.85,00:38:16.04
I still can't forgive you[br]for what you did.

00:38:16.53,00:38:19.36
But sometimes when I'm with you,[br]I just feel so. . . .

00:38:19.81,00:38:20.80
What?

00:38:21.93,00:38:23.44
I just feel. . . .

00:38:25.25,00:38:27.52
-I just--[br]-What?

00:38:28.01,00:38:28.80
I feel--

00:38:37.09,00:38:38.68
No! I don't care!

00:38:38.93,00:38:42.81
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker[br]with you for practice!

00:38:43.13,00:38:45.08
But I made cards!

00:38:48.09,00:38:49.08
Good night.

00:38:50.05,00:38:51.60
I'm going upstairs.

00:38:52.13,00:38:53.84
-Good night.[br]-Good night.

00:39:00.53,00:39:02.84
Wanna play strip poker[br]for practice?

00:39:19.65,00:39:20.76
My ass!

00:39:58.49,00:39:59.89
Oh, it's me! It's me!

00:40:00.13,00:40:03.00
-I didn't wanna make any noise![br]-Then don't break in!

00:40:04.81,00:40:07.20
-I'm sorry![br]-What are you doing here?

00:40:07.73,00:40:11.24
I came to fill your ice cube tray.

00:40:12.45,00:40:13.32
What?

00:40:16.73,00:40:18.28
Okay, look.

00:40:19.69,00:40:23.47
I took this picture from your fridge.[br]I know that this is my father.

00:40:23.73,00:40:26.92
This is Frank Buffay, and you were[br]standing next to him!

00:40:27.49,00:40:29.76
I deserve to know where I came from.

00:40:30.01,00:40:33.04
So if you can help me find my father,[br]then you should.

00:40:33.25,00:40:35.36
Otherwise, you're just mean.

00:40:37.69,00:40:39.76
So just tell me the truth.

00:40:40.21,00:40:41.28
All right.

00:40:42.09,00:40:45.97
The man in that picture[br]is Chuck Mangione.

00:40:48.01,00:40:50.44
My father is Chuck Mangione?

00:40:50.89,00:40:52.56
That's just Chuck Mangione.

00:40:52.81,00:40:55.04
I sold him a house last year.

00:40:55.25,00:40:59.13
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't[br]know where your father is.

00:40:59.33,00:41:01.04
And that's the truth.

00:41:03.13,00:41:04.88
But you're right.

00:41:06.05,00:41:08.84
I think a person should know[br]where they come from.

00:41:09.53,00:41:11.40
Which is why l. . . .

00:41:20.13,00:41:21.56
I'm your mother.

00:41:26.61,00:41:29.64
I wanted to tell you[br]yesterday, but I just. . .

00:41:29.89,00:41:31.60
. . .felt all floopy, and. . . .

00:41:34.69,00:41:36.76
You guys are getting back together.

00:41:37.09,00:41:39.16
She doesn't even know what she wants.

00:41:39.41,00:41:41.32
Rachel's still mad at me.

00:41:41.57,00:41:44.68
Then you gotta back away.[br]You don't need that kind of hurt.

00:41:44.93,00:41:46.52
Take it from a guy who's. . .

00:41:46.97,00:41:49.88
. . .never had a long-term relationship.

00:41:50.85,00:41:55.16
I know, but I really want to go[br]up there and finish that kiss.

00:41:57.41,00:41:59.68
The water is great.[br]You should go in.

00:41:59.93,00:42:02.24
No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

00:42:03.53,00:42:04.36
Well, good night.

00:42:04.61,00:42:05.56
Good night.

00:42:06.89,00:42:07.88
Don't be too long.

00:42:08.13,00:42:09.48
Okey-dokey.

00:42:11.01,00:42:13.24
There is not one hair on that head.

00:42:13.49,00:42:17.88
It'll grow back, right?[br]And she's really fun, and she's cool.

00:42:18.13,00:42:19.88
And I'm finally moving on.

00:42:20.13,00:42:22.64
Getting over Rachel was so--

00:42:23.85,00:42:26.84
I'm finally feeling sane.[br]And if I go up there. . .

00:42:27.05,00:42:28.64
. . .and I kiss her. . . .

00:42:28.89,00:42:30.64
God, I want to kiss her!

00:42:31.53,00:42:35.16
And it doesn't work out. Do I wanna[br]put myself through that again?

00:42:35.41,00:42:36.68
Let me get this straight.

00:42:36.89,00:42:41.56
If you go with Bonnie, you do the[br]smart, healthy thing and move on.

00:42:41.81,00:42:45.12
Right? And if you go with Rachel,[br]Bonnie's free tonight?

00:43:09.13,00:43:09.96
Hi there.

00:43:11.81,00:43:13.96
That's that weird voice again.

00:43:14.21,00:43:15.43
Let me try it again.

00:43:15.65,00:43:18.24
You'll wanna date this next guy,[br]I swear!

00:43:23.57,00:43:24.92
Hi, I'm Dorf!

00:43:27.01,00:43:28.84
Your date for the evening.

00:43:31.21,00:43:34.40
Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?[br]That's good stuff!

00:00:00.00,00:00:00.10


00:00:03.69,00:00:07.52
So your first sexual experience[br]was with a woman?

00:00:08.33,00:00:10.84
I was 1 5.[br]It was my best friend, Ruth.

00:00:11.05,00:00:13.36
And we got drunk on that hard cider.

00:00:13.61,00:00:16.25
And then suddenly,[br]we were making out.

00:00:17.41,00:00:18.24
Tell it again.

00:00:21.81,00:00:22.60
Seriously.

00:00:25.61,00:00:28.07
Can that woman talk[br]about anything else but sex?

00:00:29.49,00:00:33.24
Yeah, sure. Earlier she was[br]talking about geography.

00:00:34.13,00:00:37.44
She was listing the countries[br]she's done it in.

00:00:39.25,00:00:41.08
I think we all[br]learned something.

00:00:42.65,00:00:44.76
Hey, you guys! Look what I found!

00:00:45.01,00:00:46.88
That's my mom's writing. Look.

00:00:47.33,00:00:50.84
"Me and Frank and Phoebe,[br]graduation, 1 965. "

00:00:51.05,00:00:54.32
-Do you know what that means?[br]-That you're actually 50?

00:00:55.05,00:00:57.69
That's not "me" Phoebe.[br]That's her pal, Phoebe.

00:00:57.93,00:01:00.20
According to her yearbook,[br]they were BFF.

00:01:01.81,00:01:03.00
Best Friends Forever.

00:01:03.93,00:01:04.96
That's great!

00:01:05.21,00:01:09.20
I know! She probably has all kinds[br]of stories about my parents.

00:01:09.41,00:01:11.08
She might know where my dad is.

00:01:11.29,00:01:13.28
I looked her up.[br]She lives by the beach.

00:01:13.53,00:01:15.56
Maybe this weekend we can[br]go there.

00:01:16.81,00:01:19.76
-Shoot, I can't go. I have to work.[br]-That's too bad.

00:01:20.45,00:01:22.00
Big fat bummer.

00:01:23.53,00:01:25.84
So tomorrow we'll drive out[br]to Montauk.

00:01:26.05,00:01:27.92
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!

00:01:30.25,00:01:32.40
The One At the Beach

00:02:20.61,00:02:22.04
Would you look at them?

00:02:23.13,00:02:25.16
I'm never gonna find[br]a boyfriend again.

00:02:25.41,00:02:27.64
I'm gonna die an old maid.

00:02:27.89,00:02:30.04
You're not gonna die an old maid.

00:02:30.25,00:02:32.71
Maybe an old spinster cook.

00:02:35.61,00:02:38.28
-Thanks.[br]-Besides, worse comes to worse. . .

00:02:38.49,00:02:40.24
. . .I'll be your boyfriend.

00:02:43.45,00:02:44.44
Yeah, right.

00:02:47.61,00:02:49.32
Why is that so funny?

00:02:49.57,00:02:51.48
You made a joke, right?

00:02:51.73,00:02:53.21
So I laughed.

00:02:55.73,00:02:57.16
A little too hard.

00:02:58.53,00:03:00.28
Am I not boyfriend material?

00:03:02.09,00:03:03.00
You're Chandler.

00:03:05.01,00:03:07.24
You know. Chandler!

00:03:07.69,00:03:10.60
Okay, so we've established[br]my name, and hit me.

00:03:11.49,00:03:14.08
But say we weren't friends.[br]Say it's a blind date.

00:03:14.33,00:03:18.68
I show up at your door and I'm,[br]like, "Hey, nice to meet you. "

00:03:20.21,00:03:24.04
I'd probably be scared of a guy[br]using a fake voice.

00:03:25.33,00:03:26.92
Oh, good. You bought food.

00:03:27.17,00:03:29.04
No, just my luggage.

00:03:36.13,00:03:38.36
I am having the best karma this week.

00:03:38.57,00:03:40.48
I find this woman[br]who knew my parents. . .

00:03:40.73,00:03:43.64
. . .and then my client[br]gives me his beach house.

00:03:43.85,00:03:46.49
What about that bike[br]messenger you hit?

00:03:46.73,00:03:49.00
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.

00:03:51.01,00:03:52.84
Hey, check out the hat!

00:03:56.09,00:03:57.92
Wait a minute, I know that hat.

00:03:58.61,00:04:00.09
I was taken aboard that hat.

00:04:01.65,00:04:03.52
They did experiments on me.

00:04:03.73,00:04:05.05
I can't have children!

00:04:06.41,00:04:08.44
Seriously, where did you get the hat?

00:04:08.69,00:04:09.84
Ross gave it to me.

00:04:10.09,00:04:12.16
I think she looks good.

00:04:13.25,00:04:14.76
Did he buy it for you. . .

00:04:15.25,00:04:16.52
. . .or win it for you?

00:04:18.01,00:04:20.28
Excuse me,[br]my fashion-impaired friends. . .

00:04:20.53,00:04:22.44
. . .I'm here to tell you[br]hats are back.

00:04:22.69,00:04:26.24
And this time, they've ganged up[br]and formed one giant super-hat.

00:04:32.37,00:04:33.16
Go, go, go!

00:04:33.37,00:04:35.48
Now everybody wants to be[br]under the hat!

00:04:42.93,00:04:44.48
What's with all this sand?

00:04:44.73,00:04:47.16
Bob said there might be flood damage.

00:04:47.41,00:04:49.52
Either that or he has[br]a really big cat.

00:04:54.37,00:04:56.16
It's kind of an unusual house.

00:04:56.41,00:05:00.04
It has three beautiful bedrooms[br]and no baths.

00:05:00.37,00:05:03.24
But, you know, the ocean[br]is right there.

00:05:04.01,00:05:05.04
Knock, knock, knock.

00:05:05.53,00:05:07.36
Hang on.[br]Come in, come in.

00:05:07.61,00:05:09.52
Think about it and call me back.

00:05:11.29,00:05:12.48
Are you Phoebe Abbott?

00:05:13.61,00:05:16.80
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott![br]I'm your best friend's daughter!

00:05:19.13,00:05:20.35
You're lrwin's daughter?

00:05:20.61,00:05:23.28
I mean your old best friend.[br]Here.

00:05:24.01,00:05:27.84
-Lily? From high school? Remember?[br]-Oh, God, Lily. Yes.

00:05:28.05,00:05:30.00
Of course I remember Lily.

00:05:31.89,00:05:32.72
Then you must be--

00:05:32.97,00:05:34.29
Phoebe, Phoebe.

00:05:35.93,00:05:38.12
She named me after you, I guess.

00:05:38.53,00:05:41.09
Wow. Well.[br]Look, there's Frank!

00:05:41.29,00:05:42.88
Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes!

00:05:43.13,00:05:45.24
That's my dad. That's Frank!

00:05:45.45,00:05:47.84
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.

00:05:48.45,00:05:50.68
Take it easy.[br]If you want, there's cookies.

00:05:50.93,00:05:53.65
Or sangria! I could make sangria!

00:05:53.89,00:05:55.80
Sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.

00:05:58.53,00:06:02.00
Anyway, I've been[br]looking for my father.

00:06:03.01,00:06:06.44
-Have you heard from him or seen him?[br]-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:06:06.65,00:06:09.84
I lost track of everybody[br]after high school.

00:06:12.41,00:06:16.04
Well, so tell me everything[br]about my parents. Everything.

00:06:16.25,00:06:19.28
Oh, well, you know,[br]we were always together.

00:06:19.53,00:06:22.84
-The other kids had a nickname for us.[br]-What was it?

00:06:23.05,00:06:24.48
The Three Losers.

00:06:25.33,00:06:26.65
Oh, poor Lily.

00:06:28.65,00:06:32.64
I heard what happened. That must[br]have been just terrible for you. . .

00:06:32.89,00:06:34.68
. . .Iosing your mother that way.

00:06:35.85,00:06:37.48
Yeah, no, it was great.

00:06:48.61,00:06:51.12
You know what a really good[br]rainy-day game is?

00:06:51.37,00:06:53.04
I mean, naked game.

00:06:54.05,00:06:55.84
We should play strip poker.

00:06:56.29,00:06:57.24
Are you crazy?

00:06:57.49,00:07:01.20
Come on. When you go away,[br]you have to play. It's, like, a law.

00:07:02.61,00:07:04.16
-All done.[br]-Thank you.

00:07:04.41,00:07:06.12
Okay. Who's next?

00:07:10.73,00:07:11.95
No way!

00:07:12.17,00:07:16.16
Come on, please. I'm bored.[br]You let me do it once before.

00:07:20.33,00:07:23.44
Well, if that's the rule[br]this weekend. . . .

00:07:25.33,00:07:28.12
-Get away.[br]-Take it like a man. Come on!

00:07:30.01,00:07:31.00
Big bullies!

00:07:44.49,00:07:45.64
How are we doing?

00:07:45.89,00:07:47.44
Bored and bored.

00:07:48.93,00:07:51.88
You know what naked card game's[br]never boring?

00:07:54.25,00:07:55.84
So what's Phoebe like?

00:07:56.13,00:07:59.24
I'm kind, caring and sweet.[br]What's Monica like?

00:08:00.73,00:08:03.08
No, the other Phoebe.[br]The one you went to see?

00:08:03.33,00:08:05.89
I think she knows where my dad is!

00:08:06.09,00:08:06.96
Cool!

00:08:07.21,00:08:08.00
Where is he?

00:08:08.21,00:08:11.04
She was pretending she hasn't[br]heard from him. . .

00:08:11.29,00:08:13.28
. . .but I found this picture.

00:08:13.53,00:08:15.84
Isn't this what he would[br]look like now?

00:08:16.61,00:08:17.44
Totally familiar.

00:08:20.97,00:08:22.08
Why would she lie to you?

00:08:22.33,00:08:25.44
We're having dinner tomorrow.[br]Maybe she'll tell me then.

00:08:25.65,00:08:27.88
Maybe she just wanted[br]to give him time. . .

00:08:28.13,00:08:30.04
. . .to buy me presents.[br]I don't know.

00:08:31.37,00:08:33.04
So you're all bored?

00:08:34.09,00:08:37.36
I'll close my eyes and point[br]to someone. Whoever it is. . .

00:08:37.61,00:08:40.84
. . .has to think of something[br]fun to do. And we have to do it.

00:08:41.09,00:08:42.80
Okay! Fan out! Fan out!

00:08:46.49,00:08:48.52
You know, we could just do this!

00:08:52.65,00:08:54.72
We all have to play strip poker?

00:08:58.09,00:08:59.44
Strip Happy Days Game?

00:09:00.45,00:09:05.36
I couldn't find cards, so it was this[br]or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.

00:09:06.33,00:09:07.36
Done.

00:09:09.41,00:09:14.04
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.[br]Collect two cool points. "

00:09:15.33,00:09:18.72
Get five points, you get to make[br]someone take off one item of clothing.

00:09:18.97,00:09:21.43
It hasn't happened yet,[br]but we're very excited.

00:09:22.53,00:09:23.72
Okay, come on.

00:09:24.25,00:09:29.16
Daddy needs a new electromagnetic[br]microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.

00:09:34.41,00:09:38.52
"Take Pinky Tuscadero up[br]to lnspiration Point.

00:09:38.77,00:09:40.84
Collect three cool points. " Yeah!

00:09:41.05,00:09:42.68
Which gives me five.

00:09:42.93,00:09:45.57
And let's see, who is gonna lose[br]their clothes?

00:09:46.69,00:09:50.00
I think I pick our strip poker[br]sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.

00:09:53.57,00:09:55.68
All right, relax. It's just a shoe.

00:09:58.29,00:10:02.44
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.[br]Collect three cool points. "

00:10:02.69,00:10:07.44
Which means I have five and[br]that means I get Joey's boxers.

00:10:13.53,00:10:15.04
Fine. Gang up on me.

00:10:15.29,00:10:17.93
I got you all,[br]right where I want you.

00:10:18.41,00:10:20.08
Come on! Take them off!

00:10:20.33,00:10:21.84
Actually, it's kind of cold.

00:10:22.05,00:10:25.40
What if I keep them on and[br]give you a peek at the good stuff?

00:10:25.89,00:10:27.88
I'm gonna make more margaritas.

00:10:28.13,00:10:30.96
What are you doing?[br]Trying to get me drunk?

00:10:31.25,00:10:33.40
I'm just making margaritas.

00:10:34.69,00:10:36.20
Think I'll help her out.

00:10:39.89,00:10:41.11
What is going on here?

00:10:41.33,00:10:42.24
What?

00:10:42.49,00:10:45.84
You're painting his toenails.[br]Chasing him around the room.

00:10:46.05,00:10:47.04
Monica, please.

00:10:47.29,00:10:49.24
He's totally flirting with you too.

00:10:50.33,00:10:51.55
He is, isn't he?

00:10:53.13,00:10:57.09
I don't know. Maybe it's just[br]being here at the beach together. . .

00:10:57.33,00:10:58.73
. . .but it's like something--

00:11:04.21,00:11:05.00
Hi, Bonnie.

00:11:06.21,00:11:08.85
My boss let me off early,[br]so I took the train.

00:11:09.05,00:11:10.32
What are you guys doing?

00:11:10.57,00:11:12.96
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.

00:11:14.01,00:11:15.52
Cool! I'll catch up!

00:11:24.65,00:11:27.32
So you still don't think. . .

00:11:27.61,00:11:29.24
. . .I'm boyfriend material?

00:11:31.29,00:11:34.28
I saw you checking me out[br]during the game last night.

00:11:34.73,00:11:36.64
You didn't even take off your pants.

00:11:36.89,00:11:37.72
Lucky for you.

00:11:39.65,00:11:41.20
-What?[br]-I don't know.

00:11:42.81,00:11:46.72
Well, is everybody else having[br]just the best time?

00:11:48.01,00:11:49.16
Joey's asleep.

00:11:58.73,00:12:01.84
He passed out. We put sand[br]around him to keep him warm.

00:12:04.73,00:12:08.08
Well, I assume the happy couple[br]isn't up yet?

00:12:08.33,00:12:10.52
Did you guys hear them last night?

00:12:10.81,00:12:14.96
I don't know what they were doing,[br]but sea turtles came up to the house.

00:12:17.33,00:12:18.44
Good morning.

00:12:19.33,00:12:20.65
-How'd you sleep?[br]-Great.

00:12:20.89,00:12:21.68
Like a log.

00:12:21.93,00:12:23.20
Us too.

00:12:25.21,00:12:26.24
I'm going for a walk.

00:12:31.69,00:12:34.48
Good morning.[br]Nice breasts by the way.

00:12:44.89,00:12:46.44
Hey, what happened to you?

00:12:46.65,00:12:49.92
Oh, nothing. I just felt like[br]hanging out and reading.

00:12:50.53,00:12:54.57
The water was so great. We jumped[br]off this pier and my suit came off.

00:12:56.09,00:12:57.44
Sorry I missed that.

00:12:57.65,00:12:59.72
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.

00:13:02.01,00:13:04.24
I brought back half the beach[br]in my hair.

00:13:04.49,00:13:06.48
It was easier when I shaved my head.

00:13:11.25,00:13:13.24
You know, I gotta tell you. . .

00:13:13.45,00:13:16.28
. . .I just loved your look[br]when you were bald.

00:13:16.93,00:13:18.12
Really?

00:13:18.93,00:13:21.49
I think about shaving it[br]again sometimes.

00:13:22.05,00:13:23.16
Really?

00:13:24.21,00:13:25.80
You definitely should do that.

00:13:26.93,00:13:28.84
You know what? I should do it!

00:13:29.09,00:13:31.68
You know what? Thank you.[br]You are so cool.

00:13:31.93,00:13:33.72
Oh, stop. Go on.

00:13:34.25,00:13:36.64
-Now go shave that head.[br]-All right.

00:13:47.73,00:13:49.05
What's the matter?

00:13:49.25,00:13:51.89
She canceled.[br]My namesake canceled on me.

00:13:52.13,00:13:55.44
She claims she had to go out of town.[br]She's avoiding me.

00:13:55.69,00:13:59.04
She doesn't want to tell me[br]where my father is. She knows!

00:13:59.29,00:14:01.32
Pheebs, that sucks.

00:14:02.45,00:14:05.24
Well, don't[br]"Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.

00:14:06.25,00:14:08.64
-Where are you going?[br]-She's out of town.

00:14:08.89,00:14:11.48
Something in her house[br]will tell me where he is.

00:14:11.85,00:14:14.84
Some people call that[br]"breaking and entering. "

00:14:15.29,00:14:17.64
Well, are any of those people here?

00:14:18.89,00:14:21.20
Look, I'll do something nice, okay?

00:14:22.45,00:14:24.44
I'll fill her ice trays. Good?

00:14:26.37,00:14:27.32
Hey, everybody!

00:14:32.93,00:14:34.08
Look what you did!

00:14:35.85,00:14:36.96
You wanna touch it?

00:14:37.17,00:14:39.12
No, but it's great.

00:14:39.37,00:14:40.88
Come on, touch it.

00:14:45.01,00:14:47.92
You can feel all the bones[br]in your skull.

00:14:56.29,00:15:00.36
I was having a little chat[br]with Bonnie, and guess what?

00:15:00.61,00:15:03.72
She brought up who was[br]behind the head-shaving idea.

00:15:03.97,00:15:06.64
And now, who was it?[br]Oh, that's right. It was you!

00:15:08.41,00:15:10.28
That was her idea.

00:15:10.53,00:15:13.20
I just gave her a nudge.

00:15:13.45,00:15:15.64
She said you gave her the razor.

00:15:18.21,00:15:20.24
So anyone up for a midnight dip?

00:15:20.49,00:15:22.48
-No, I'm good.[br]-No, thanks.

00:15:22.73,00:15:25.64
-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.[br]-Okay, have fun.

00:15:26.93,00:15:30.04
Come on, see?[br]She doesn't look that bad.

00:15:30.81,00:15:33.88
You can see the moonlight[br]bouncing off her head!

00:15:35.41,00:15:36.68
What were you thinking?

00:15:36.93,00:15:38.08
I don't know.

00:15:38.33,00:15:39.92
You balded my girlfriend!

00:15:40.17,00:15:41.12
All right.

00:15:43.21,00:15:46.32
Do you think it's easy for me[br]to see you with somebody else?

00:15:46.57,00:15:48.48
You're the one who ended it!

00:15:48.73,00:15:52.56
Because I was mad at you![br]Not because I stopped loving you!

00:15:53.69,00:15:54.84
You still love me?

00:15:58.33,00:15:59.24
You still love me.

00:16:00.29,00:16:01.28
Yeah, so?

00:16:01.53,00:16:02.52
You love me.

00:16:07.69,00:16:09.04
What does this mean?

00:16:09.25,00:16:11.89
I mean, do you want[br]to get back together?

00:16:12.13,00:16:13.88
No! Maybe!

00:16:14.73,00:16:16.21
I don't know.

00:16:21.85,00:16:25.04
I still can't forgive you[br]for what you did.

00:16:25.53,00:16:28.36
But sometimes when I'm with you,[br]I just feel so. . . .

00:16:28.81,00:16:29.80
What?

00:16:30.93,00:16:32.44
I just feel. . . .

00:16:34.25,00:16:36.52
-I just--[br]-What?

00:16:37.01,00:16:37.80
I feel--

00:16:46.09,00:16:47.68
No! I don't care!

00:16:47.93,00:16:51.81
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker[br]with you for practice!

00:16:52.13,00:16:54.08
But I made cards!

00:16:57.09,00:16:58.08
Good night.

00:16:59.05,00:17:00.60
I'm going upstairs.

00:17:01.13,00:17:02.84
-Good night.[br]-Good night.

00:17:09.53,00:17:11.84
Wanna play strip poker[br]for practice?

00:17:28.65,00:17:29.76
My ass!

00:18:07.49,00:18:08.89
Oh, it's me! It's me!

00:18:09.13,00:18:12.00
-I didn't wanna make any noise![br]-Then don't break in!

00:18:13.81,00:18:16.20
-I'm sorry![br]-What are you doing here?

00:18:16.73,00:18:20.24
I came to fill your ice cube tray.

00:18:21.45,00:18:22.32
What?

00:18:25.73,00:18:27.28
Okay, look.

00:18:28.69,00:18:32.47
I took this picture from your fridge.[br]I know that this is my father.

00:18:32.73,00:18:35.92
This is Frank Buffay, and you were[br]standing next to him!

00:18:36.49,00:18:38.76
I deserve to know where I came from.

00:18:39.01,00:18:42.04
So if you can help me find my father,[br]then you should.

00:18:42.25,00:18:44.36
Otherwise, you're just mean.

00:18:46.69,00:18:48.76
So just tell me the truth.

00:18:49.21,00:18:50.28
All right.

00:18:51.09,00:18:54.97
The man in that picture[br]is Chuck Mangione.

00:18:57.01,00:18:59.44
My father is Chuck Mangione?

00:18:59.89,00:19:01.56
That's just Chuck Mangione.

00:19:01.81,00:19:04.04
I sold him a house last year.

00:19:04.25,00:19:08.13
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't[br]know where your father is.

00:19:08.33,00:19:10.04
And that's the truth.

00:19:12.13,00:19:13.88
But you're right.

00:19:15.05,00:19:17.84
I think a person should know[br]where they come from.

00:19:18.53,00:19:20.40
Which is why l. . . .

00:19:29.13,00:19:30.56
I'm your mother.

00:19:35.61,00:19:38.64
I wanted to tell you[br]yesterday, but I just. . .

00:19:38.89,00:19:40.60
. . .felt all floopy, and. . . .

00:19:43.69,00:19:45.76
You guys are getting back together.

00:19:46.09,00:19:48.16
She doesn't even know what she wants.

00:19:48.41,00:19:50.32
Rachel's still mad at me.

00:19:50.57,00:19:53.68
Then you gotta back away.[br]You don't need that kind of hurt.

00:19:53.93,00:19:55.52
Take it from a guy who's. . .

00:19:55.97,00:19:58.88
. . .never had a long-term relationship.

00:19:59.85,00:20:04.16
I know, but I really want to go[br]up there and finish that kiss.

00:20:06.41,00:20:08.68
The water is great.[br]You should go in.

00:20:08.93,00:20:11.24
No, thanks. I just had an M&M.

00:20:12.53,00:20:13.36
Well, good night.

00:20:13.61,00:20:14.56
Good night.

00:20:15.89,00:20:16.88
Don't be too long.

00:20:17.13,00:20:18.48
Okey-dokey.

00:20:20.01,00:20:22.24
There is not one hair on that head.

00:20:22.49,00:20:26.88
It'll grow back, right?[br]And she's really fun, and she's cool.

00:20:27.13,00:20:28.88
And I'm finally moving on.

00:20:29.13,00:20:31.64
Getting over Rachel was so--

00:20:32.85,00:20:35.84
I'm finally feeling sane.[br]And if I go up there. . .

00:20:36.05,00:20:37.64
. . .and I kiss her. . . .

00:20:37.89,00:20:39.64
God, I want to kiss her!

00:20:40.53,00:20:44.16
And it doesn't work out. Do I wanna[br]put myself through that again?

00:20:44.41,00:20:45.68
Let me get this straight.

00:20:45.89,00:20:50.56
If you go with Bonnie, you do the[br]smart, healthy thing and move on.

00:20:50.81,00:20:54.12
Right? And if you go with Rachel,[br]Bonnie's free tonight?

00:21:18.13,00:21:18.96
Hi there.

00:21:20.81,00:21:22.96
That's that weird voice again.

00:21:23.21,00:21:24.43
Let me try it again.

00:21:24.65,00:21:27.24
You'll wanna date this next guy,[br]I swear!

00:21:32.57,00:21:33.92
Hi, I'm Dorf!

00:21:36.01,00:21:37.84
Your date for the evening.

00:21:40.21,00:21:43.40
Oh, come on. Dorf on dating?[br]That's good stuff!


{58}{118}Phoebe found out about this lady...
{124}{222}...who knew her parents,|and I don't know what happened.
{228}{279}I'm your mother.
{285}{359}{y:i}Monica joked she|{y:i}wouldn't date Chandler.
{365}{433}{y:i}I don't know what|{y:i}happened there either.
{439}{492}{y:i}Ross' new girlfriend shows up.
{498}{591}{y:i}Rachel gets Bonnie to shave her head.|{y:i}Then they kiss.
{597}{675}{y:i}Now he has to choose|{y:i}Rachel or the bald girl.
{681}{730}I don't know what|happened there either.
{736}{832}Hold on.|Let me go get Chandler.
{1203}{1304}She's helping me.|My head's sunburned.
{1336}{1415}- Thanks a million.|- You're welcome a million.
{1421}{1508}I'll be in our room.
{1785}{1814}Oh, my God!
{1820}{1893}I know.
{1946}{2016}I got to go.
{2025}{2096}I got to go break up with Bonnie.
{2102}{2139}Here? Now?
{2145}{2189}I can't stay here all night.
{2195}{2274}If I go in there, she'll want to...
{2280}{2327}...do stuff.
{2333}{2395}Can't you say|you aren't in the mood?
{2401}{2473}No, she likes that.
{2485}{2527}Faking sleep doesn't work.
{2533}{2633}I've woken up many times with her...
{2665}{2773}- Why am I telling you?|- I don't know.
{2958}{3060}- Not every morning...|- Making it worse!
{3066}{3138}The One with the Jellyfish
{4221}{4292}You probably want to know|how it happened.
{4298}{4357}I think I can figure it out.
{4363}{4467}I was born, and then|everyone lied their asses off.
{4473}{4530}No, it wasn't like that.
{4536}{4645}Remember how I said|Lilly, Frank and I were close?
{4651}{4689}We were very close.
{4695}{4728}How close?
{4734}{4858}The three of us were|kind of a couple.
{4865}{4922}I don't know how that would work.
{4928}{4980}I'm not asking!
{4986}{5059}Anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...
{5065}{5105}...and I was...
{5111}{5211}...scared.|I was stupid and selfish...
{5217}{5323}I was 18 years old.|Remember what it was like to be 18?
{5329}{5396}Mom killed herself|and my dad ran off.
{5402}{5534}I lived in a Gremlin with a guy|who talked to his hand.
{5550}{5656}I'm sorry. I thought I'd left you|with the best parents.
{5662}{5731}I didn't hear about them|till a few years ago.
{5737}{5787}By then, you were already grown-up.
{5793}{5900}You're here and I would|really like to get to know you.
{5906}{5976}Well, everybody does.
{5982}{6031}I'm a really cool person.
{6037}{6159}You had 29 years to find out,|but you didn't even try.
{6165}{6254}You walked out on me,|and I'll do the same.
{6260}{6358}I don't ever want to see you again.
{6416}{6498}Where's my purse?
{6508}{6556}Shoot! We're out of soda.
{6562}{6618}- I'll get you some.|- Really?
{6624}{6713}No, because I'm not your boyfriend.
{6730}{6813}Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?
{6835}{6955}My mom's friend, Phoebe,|is actually my birth mom.
{7000}{7074}I found a dried-up seahorse.
{7080}{7113}What do you mean?
{7119}{7227}My new mom,|who's a big fat abandoner.
{7227}{7348}Don't you want to stay here|and talk about it?
{7358}{7438}I need to be alone.
{7748}{7810}It's over.
{7810}{7848}Was it awful?
{7854}{7902}It was long.
{7908}{7957}I didn't realize how late it was...
{7963}{8073}...till I saw the five o'clock shadow|on her head.
{8166}{8301}She didn't want to stay.|I called a cab. She just left.
{8448}{8496}I wrote you a letter.
{8502}{8567}Oh, thank you!
{8573}{8653}I like mail.
{8720}{8819}It's just some things I've been|thinking about. About us.
{8825}{8907}Before we even think about us|getting back together...
{8913}{9020}...I need to know|how you feel about this stuff.
{9236}{9324}It's 5:30 in the morning.
{9357}{9477}So I'd better get|cracking on this baby.
{9507}{9582}Come up when you're done.
{9588}{9649}I'll be up...
{9655}{9728}...in 18 pages.
{9743}{9811}Front and back.
{9818}{9898}Very exciting!
{10487}{10558}Why didn't you come up?
{10564}{10628}Done.
{10633}{10748}- You just finished?|- I wanted to be thorough.
{10768}{10850}This is clearly|very important to you. To us.
{10856}{10946}I wanted to read|every word carefully.
{10952}{11012}Twice.
{11086}{11152}Does it?
{11262}{11319}Sorry?
{11338}{11411}Does it?
{11571}{11678}I wanted to give that whole|"Does it?" part another glance.
{11684}{11759}What do you mean?|You said you read it twice.
{11765}{11851}It either does or doesn't.|If you have to think...
{11857}{11934}No, I don't have to think about it.
{11940}{11982}In fact...
{11988}{12060}...I've decided.|I have decided...
{12066}{12143}...that it...
{12237}{12308}...does.
{12674}{12693}Are you sure?
{12699}{12778}Sure, I'm sure!
{12918}{13022}There's a nuclear holocaust.|I'm the last man on earth.
{13028}{13105}Would you go out with me?
{13208}{13274}I've got canned goods.
{13292}{13342}Take a look at this!
{13348}{13460}Check this baby out!|Dug me a hole.
{13473}{13559}Excellent hole, Joe.
{13562}{13614}Oh, no! My hole!
{13620}{13675}My foot!
{13681}{13711}What is it?
{13717}{13792}Jellyfish sting!|It hurts!
{13798}{13845}Can we help you to the house?
{13851}{13883}It's two miles.
{13889}{13979}And I'm tired from digging.
{13980}{14022}Damn the jellyfish!
{14028}{14086}Damn all the jellyfish!
{14092}{14123}Do something.
{14129}{14163}There's only one thing.
{14169}{14195}What is it?
{14201}{14267}Pee on it.
{14299}{14323}Gross!
{14329}{14381}I saw it on Discovery Channel.
{14387}{14477}He's right.|There's ammonia in that...
{14483}{14517}...that kills the pain.
{14523}{14639}Forget it.|It doesn't hurt that bad!
{14645}{14728}You can use my hole for privacy.
{14776}{14888}I'm ready to get|the hell out of here.
{14911}{14976}Are you...?
{14980}{15027}That's so great!
{15033}{15098}Not for Bonnie.
{15110}{15183}But for you, yea!
{15196}{15313}- How was the beach?|- Nothing. I don't know.
{15341}{15387}- What happened?|- Nothing.
{15393}{15452}- I'm going to shower.|- Me too.
{15458}{15512}Me too.
{15518}{15557}I'll put this in the car.
{15563}{15643}I have to go pack!
{15649}{15711}- And it really does?|- It does.
{15717}{15804}It really and truly does.
{16312}{16417}It so does not!
{16507}{16624}She wants me to take responsibility|for everything that went wrong.
{16630}{16757}She goes on for five pages|about how I was unfaithful to her.
{16763}{16827}We were on a break!
{16833}{16962}If you say that one more time,|I'll break up with you.
{16968}{17056}This breakup was not all my fault.|She says here...
{17062}{17129}..."If you accept full responsibility...
{17135}{17195}...I can begin to trust you again."
{17201}{17326}"Does that seem like|something you can do? Does it?"
{17418}{17496}You have what you want.|You're back with her.
{17502}{17574}If you bring this up now,|you'll wreck it.
{17580}{17672}Yeah, I know.|You're right.
{17690}{17719}I'll let it go.
{17725}{17801}But you know how hard it is|to forget this?
{17807}{17845}Sure, it's hard...
{17851}{17932}...but you don't have to talk about it.
{17938}{17995}A lot happened on that trip...
{18001}{18114}...that we should|never, ever talk about.
{18138}{18229}What happened on that beach?
{18232}{18342}It's between us and the sea, Ross.
{18533}{18596}Hi, Ursula.
{18602}{18689}I know that we haven't talked|in a long time.
{18695}{18810}Our mom is not our birth mom.|This other lady is our birth mom.
{18816}{18896}Right, the one that lives in Montauk.
{18902}{18926}You know her?
{18932}{19022}No. I read about her|in Mom's suicide note.
{19028}{19147}There was a suicide note?|Do you still have it?
{19153}{19228}Hang on.
{19246}{19317}I can't believe you didn't tell me.
{19323}{19402}Yeah, so how have you been doing?
{19408}{19475}Shut up!
{19547}{19611}"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.|I'll miss you."
{19617}{19702}"P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."
{19708}{19772}You just wrote this!
{19778}{19865}It's pretty much the gist.
{19871}{19983}Except for the poem.|You read the poem, right?
{20003}{20088}All right. Hang on.
{20170}{20258}Pass the cheese, please.
{20348}{20455}You can't even look at me, can you?
{20485}{20577}It's Phoebe!|We can talk to Phoebe!
{20598}{20641}I'm too depressed to talk.
{20647}{20720}I'll give you $1000 to talk.
{20726}{20864}What about making that|beach trip an annual thing?
{20880}{20932}What happened out there?
{20938}{21017}What? We took a walk.|Nothing happened.
{21023}{21097}I came back with nothing all over me.
{21103}{21184}What happened?|Joey?
{21186}{21215}All right.
{21221}{21266}We swore we'd never tell.
{21272}{21358}They'll never understand.
{21398}{21527}We have to get it out.|It's eating me alive!
{21560}{21678}- Monica got stung by a jellyfish.|- All right!
{21830}{21894}I got stung.
{21900}{21979}Stung bad.
{21991}{22037}I couldn't stand.
{22043}{22084}I couldn't walk.
{22090}{22176}We were two miles from the house.
{22182}{22242}We were scared and alone.
{22248}{22344}We didn't think we could make it.
{22415}{22450}I was in pain.
{22456}{22545}And I was tired from digging.
{22569}{22652}Then Joey remembered something.
{22658}{22714}I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.
{22720}{22758}Wait, I saw that.
{22764}{22908}On the Discovery Channel.|About jellyfish and how if you...
{22980}{23055}You peed on yourself?
{23073}{23152}You can't say that!|You don't know!
{23158}{23226}I thought I would pass out.
{23232}{23311}I tried, but I couldn't...
{23317}{23381}...bend that way.
{23585}{23688}That's right.|I stepped up.
{23710}{23782}She's my friend and she needed help.
{23788}{23883}If I had to,|I'd pee on any of you.
{23983}{24006}Only...
{24012}{24078}...I couldn't.
{24126}{24204}I got the stage fright.
{24210}{24304}I wanted to help,|but there was too much pressure.
{24310}{24397}So I turned to Chandler.
{24438}{24574}Joey kept screaming at me,|"Do it now. Do it. Do it now!"
{24580}{24707}Sometimes, late at night,|I can still hear the screaming.
{24733}{24842}Because I do it through my wall|to freak you out.
{24848}{24946}{y:i}And fuchsia and mauve
{24952}{25096}{y:i}Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom
{25122}{25247}I invite all of you to count|the colors in your bedroom.
{25253}{25348}Except for you.|You go away.
{25408}{25455}I'll go in a second.
{25461}{25507}I just want to tell you...
{25513}{25609}...there wasn't a day|I didn't regret giving you up.
{25615}{25689}Okay, bye.
{25695}{25723}I'm not done.
{25729}{25815}The reason I never|looked you up was because...
{25821}{25867}...I was afraid you'd react...
{25873}{25954}...just like the way|you're reacting now.
{25960}{26077}Can't we just start from here?|Please?
{26247}{26313}Sorry.
{26337}{26392}One last thing.
{26398}{26493}You came looking for family.
{26493}{26562}I'm family.
{26568}{26639}I'm it.
{26675}{26753}Now I'm done.
{26791}{26887}It's not like we're losing anything.
{26893}{26945}I guess you're right.
{26951}{27062}It's not like we know each other|or have anything in common.
{27068}{27111}I don't know.|It's not like...
{27117}{27218}...we don't have anything in common.
{27223}{27304}I mean, I like pizza.
{27310}{27374}I like pizza!
{27386}{27445}Wait, I like the Beatles.
{27451}{27523}Oh, my God!|So do I.
{27541}{27587}Puppies.|Cute or ugly?
{27593}{27669}So cute!
{27675}{27721}You see?
{27727}{27776}But I'm still mad at you.
{27782}{27835}I know.
{27841}{27923}I'm mad at me too.
{27926}{28032}Do you want to get something to eat?|I'm kind of hungry.
{28038}{28077}Hey! Me too!
{28083}{28210}Stop it. Now you're just|doing it to freak me out.
{28317}{28355}I missed you.
{28361}{28443}I missed you too.
{28475}{28584}I was so nervous about that letter.
{28616}{28697}But the way you|owned up to everything...
{28703}{28823}...it just showed me|how much you've grown.
{28843}{28899}I suppose.
{28905}{29002}You have, Ross.|You should give yourself credit.
{29008}{29111}My mom never thought|this would work out.
{29117}{29243}She said, "Once a cheater,|always a cheater."
{29303}{29385}I just wish we hadn't|lost those four months.
{29391}{29543}But if time was what you needed|to gain a little perspective...
{29545}{29632}We were on a break!
{29638}{29693}- Coffeehouse?|- You bet.
{29699}{29796}It took two people|to break up this relationship.
{29802}{29924}You and that girl, which yesterday|you took full responsibility for.
{29930}{29995}I didn't know what|I took responsibility for.
{30001}{30060}I didn't finish the letter.
{30066}{30097}I fell asleep.
{30103}{30168}You fell asleep?
{30174}{30242}It was 5:30 in the morning.
{30248}{30394}And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
{30400}{30488}Front and back!
{30495}{30611}By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E|means "you are".
{30617}{30677}Y-O-U-R means "your".
{30683}{30837}I can't believe I thought of getting|back with you! We are so over.
{30843}{30901}Fine by me!
{30907}{31005}Those spelling tips will be handy|Saturday nights at home...
{31011}{31066}...playing Scrabble with Monica.
{31072}{31124}Sorry!
{31130}{31214}All that sleep you'll miss|wishing you were with me!
{31220}{31279}Don't worry about me falling asleep.
{31285}{31376}I still have your letter!
{31383}{31451}Just so you know,|it's not that common.
{31457}{31510}It doesn't happen to every guy.
{31516}{31577}And it is a big deal!
{31583}{31663}I knew it!
{31738}{31788}Gin.
{31794}{31879}We were playing gin?
{31891}{31981}If we were a couple,|we could play naked.
{31987}{32062}Would you stop?
{32081}{32100}All right.
{32106}{32149}I think you're great.
{32155}{32227}I think you're sweet and smart...
{32233}{32302}...and I love you.
{32308}{32426}But you'll always be the guy|who peed on me.
{152}{229}Wow! That ripped!
{239}{293}That ripped real nice!
{299}{399}How many times do I have to tell you?|You turn and slide.
{405}{438}Turn and slide.
{444}{485}You don't turn and slide.
{491}{569}You throw it out!
{574}{640}I get tetanus shots|every time I get dressed!
{646}{770}We're not throwing it out.|I built it with my own hands!
{776}{857}How about we sell it?
{865}{921}All right.
{927}{1012}But you'll have to tell them.
{1072}{1190}Can we stick you in another cabinet?|They seem all right with it!
{1196}{1268}The One with the Cat
{2352}{2410}{y:i}Hey, Monica.|{y:i}It's Chip.
{2416}{2440}Who's Chip?
{2446}{2503}{y:i}It was good running|{y:i}into you today.
{2509}{2579}{y:i}My number is 555-9323.|{y:i}Give me a call.
{2585}{2651}"Chip" is Chip Matthews.
{2657}{2736}The guy who took Rachel to the prom?|Why's he calling you?
{2742}{2835}Because I ran into him at the bank.|He is still so cute.
{2841}{2948}You're so lucky! He's like|the most popular guy in school!
{2954}{3022}I know!
{3049}{3134}Chip? Hi, it's Monica.
{3342}{3459}Oh, my God!|We just had the best conversation!
{3567}{3596}I was just leaving.
{3602}{3631}Good.
{3637}{3680}I've got a report to read.
{3686}{3776}It's eight pages.|I hope I don't fall asleep.
{3782}{3853}Why? Did you write it?
{3936}{3972}Look at that!
{3978}{4086}Chip Matthews called.|I wonder what he wants.
{4087}{4122}Well, actually...
{4128}{4273}I bet he sensed that I was ready|to have sex with another guy.
{4407}{4502}Why don't you give him a call?
{4766}{4877}- Are you sure you want to hear this?|- I'm sure.
{4887}{4965}Chip!|Hi, it's Rachel.
{4971}{5014}Rachel Greene.
{5020}{5117}You left me a message?
{5133}{5220}Yes, you did.|My roommate wrote it down.
{5226}{5307}Monica Geller?
{5415}{5508}Oh, that's right!
{5524}{5621}He called to ask out Monica.
{5627}{5737}That's got to be embarrassing.
{5821}{5923}{y:i}Dumb drunken bitch
{5997}{6054}Thank you!
{6101}{6131}Here's a question.
{6137}{6218}Where'd you get the "finest oak|east of the Mississippi"?
{6224}{6326}First tell us where you got|the prettiest lace in the land.
{6332}{6357}It's your ad.
{6363}{6416}Looks good?
{6422}{6530}"Stunning entertainment center, fine...
{6536}{6630}Fine Italian craftsmanship."
{6636}{6700}You're selling|the entertainment center?
{6706}{6738}Why? I love it.
{6744}{6802}You want it?
{6831}{6899}Gepetto?
{6906}{6954}Five thousand dollars?
{6960}{7001}Are you insane?
{7007}{7076}The ad alone cost $300.
{7082}{7204}I'm changing it|to $50 or your best offer.
{7210}{7345}What kind of profit is that?|And you call yourself an accountant?
{7521}{7592}What do you do?
{7592}{7644}I can't believe you don't know.
{7650}{7726}I actually don't know.
{7806}{7902}Oh, my God, no!|Shoo, kitty!
{7912}{7958}Come on, you!
{7964}{8015}Crazy!
{8021}{8076}Oh, my God!
{8082}{8123}Nothing.
{8129}{8199}What's wrong?
{8247}{8371}I just have this really strong feeling|that this cat is my mother.
{8377}{8421}The mom you met in Montauk?
{8427}{8478}She was a cat?
{8484}{8536}No. She was a human lady.
{8542}{8628}This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly.|The one that killed herself.
{8634}{8756}Have you been taking your grandmother's|glaucoma medicine again?
{8762}{8836}No, Dr. Skeptismo.
{8842}{8961}I'm sure.|First of all, there's the feeling.
{8966}{9056}And for another,|she went into my guitar case...
{9062}{9155}...which is lined with orange felt.
{9181}{9300}My mother's favorite fish|was orange roughy.
{9355}{9447}Cats like fish.
{9497}{9568}Hi, Mommy!
{9588}{9706}I haven't seen|this smile in 17 years.
{9726}{9846}- Pheebs' mom's got a huge pair of...|- Let it go!
{9942}{10034}When were you going to tell me|that you're dating Chip?
{10040}{10099}Now?
{10111}{10151}Can I go out with him?
{10157}{10271}No. I can't believe you'd want to|after what he did to me.
{10277}{10309}That thing at the prom?
{10315}{10455}I couldn't find him for hours!|He was having sex with Amy Welsh!
{10461}{10541}That was in high school.|How can it still bother you?
{10547}{10610}Why do you have|to go out with Chip?
{10616}{10656}We went to different schools.
{10662}{10730}We went to the same school.
{10736}{10785}You went to one where you were popular.
{10791}{10889}You rode on Chip's motorcycle|and wore his letterman jacket.
{10895}{11033}I went to one where I wore a band|uniform that was specially made.
{11041}{11125}They had that specially made?
{11147}{11234}It was a Home Ec project.
{11245}{11364}Oh, my God! They said|it was for the mascot.
{11396}{11509}Back then I thought that I'd never|get to go out with a Chip Matthews.
{11515}{11581}Now he's called me up|and asked me out.
{11587}{11686}The fat girl inside me really|wants to go. I owe her this.
{11692}{11751}I never let her eat.
{11757}{11843}- You go out with him.|- Really?
{11849}{11953}If possible, could you leave him|and have sex with another guy?
{11959}{12022}I'll try.
{12077}{12151}Any luck getting rid of|the entertainment center?
{12157}{12256}There were a couple calls,|but they won't work out.
{12262}{12351}Joey has a very careful|screening process.
{12357}{12455}Not everyone is qualified|to own wood and nails.
{12461}{12500}Stop it!
{12506}{12658}She keeps trying to get away.|Just like when she was alive.
{12665}{12731}How long is your mom|going to be with us?
{12737}{12774}I'm not sure.
{12780}{12871}I guess until she gets used to|the fact that there's...
{12877}{12945}...a new mom.
{12953}{13029}Now she's worried|that she'll be replaced.
{13035}{13123}That's not going to happen, is it?
{13129}{13166}I have to go make a call.
{13172}{13212}Why not use this phone?
{13218}{13326}I'm returning a call from|a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.
{13332}{13434}I just spelled the wrong word.
{13451}{13611}So am I crazy, or does Pheebs' mom|remind anyone else of a cat?
{13617}{13666}Ross, don't start.
{13672}{13781}You actually believe|there's a woman inside that cat?
{13787}{13859}I believe it.
{13861}{13886}No, you don't.
{13892}{13915}Yes, I do.
{13921}{13981}No, you...
{13987}{14036}You know what?
{14042}{14087}You won't suck me into this.
{14093}{14191}Sure I will.|Because you always have to be right.
{14197}{14283}I do not always have...
{14339}{14419}"Jurassic Park" could happen.
{14671}{14724}That's pretty nice.
{14730}{14779}"Pretty nice"?
{14785}{14870}Pardon my roommate.|He wanted to marry this.
{14876}{14955}We don't have $50.|But would you trade for it?
{14961}{15024}We got a canoe.
{15182}{15236}I don't think we need a canoe.
{15242}{15309}You got to take it.
{15361}{15415}Just take the entertainment center.
{15421}{15491}Then when you get home,|throw the canoe away.
{15497}{15591}We're not throwing it away.|I built it.
{15597}{15662}Good for you!
{15769}{15856}You won't believe|what I found on a telephone pole.
{15862}{15891}Look familiar?
{15897}{16034}Apparently Pheebs' mother|also goes by the name "Julio".
{16056}{16141}A little girl's looking for this cat.|Know what that means?
{16147}{16252}Yeah! $200 reward split five ways!
{16280}{16331}Do we have to tell her?
{16337}{16428}- Yes, we do.|- But it's made her so happy.
{16434}{16486}Little girl misses her cat.
{16492}{16590}Crazy lady thinks|her mother is in a cat.
{16596}{16663}I have to go have|dinner with my son.
{16669}{16787}Can I trust that when you see Pheebs,|you will tell her?
{16792}{16869}Thank you.
{16879}{16931}I hate when Ross is right.
{16937}{16966}He is right, isn't he?
{16972}{17036}This might be one time|when he's wrong.
{17042}{17062}You think?
{17068}{17127}He's right.
{17327}{17402}About your mom.
{17454}{17502}How's that going?
{17508}{17578}So great.|We took a nap together today.
{17584}{17679}Mom fell asleep|on my tummy and purred.
{17699}{17774}That's so sweet.
{17802}{17877}I'll go get some coffee.
{17992}{18097}What'd you say, Joe?|I'll be right there.
{18185}{18227}I just feel so...
{18233}{18323}- All right!|- I'm coming already!
{18447}{18546}Not yet, not yet, not yet!
{18656}{18698}- Hello, Chip.|- How you doing?
{18704}{18735}I'm great!
{18741}{18813}Got a great job.|I have wonderful friends.
{18819}{18971}Though I'm not seeing anyone now,|I've never felt better about myself.
{18990}{19064}So, Monica ready yet?
{19109}{19153}She'll be out in a second.
{19159}{19236}So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?
{19242}{19353}Amy Welsh?|I haven't seen her since...
{19372}{19446}So, Monica about ready?
{19476}{19526}This is the unit for you.
{19532}{19598}Sturdy construction,|tons of storage.
{19604}{19698}Some big enough to fit a grown man.
{19711}{19773}Yeah, I got in there myself once.
{19779}{19830}My roommate bet me $5 I couldn't.
{19836}{19936}Then he stuck a board|through the handles and locked me in.
{19942}{20052}It was funny till I felt|like it was a coffin.
{20065}{20183}No, you can't fit in there.|It's not deep enough.
{20230}{20274}If I can't...
{20280}{20341}...I'll knock $5 off the price.
{20347}{20435}You have yourself a deal.
{20511}{20597}See?|I told you.
{20636}{20747}Sometimes I come in here|just to get away from it.
{20764}{20834}Hey, a nickel!
{20917}{20941}Here we are.
{20947}{20996}You still have the Chipper!
{21002}{21036}The what?
{21042}{21130}That's what we called|your motorcycle in high school.
{21136}{21176}A motorcycle's a chopper.
{21182}{21231}And you're Chip.
{21237}{21291}Never mind.
{21297}{21372}I think it's cute.
{21467}{21556}A lipper from Chipper.
{21569}{21623}Are you still in touch with anyone?
{21629}{21695}There's Rachel...
{21701}{21752}...and that's it.|How about you?
{21758}{21879}I still hang with Simens and Zana.|I see Spindler, Levine, Kelly.
{21885}{21933}I run into Goldie...
{21939}{21996}...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...
{22002}{22064}...J.T., Beardsley.
{22070}{22093}Is that all?
{22099}{22201}After high school,|you kind of lose touch.
{22207}{22251}I ran into Richard Dorfman.
{22257}{22367}- How is he?|- Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.
{22385}{22418}Isn't he an architect?
{22424}{22502}They still wear underwear.
{22782}{22847}Oh, my God!
{22867}{22927}What?
{22960}{23042}Are you all right?
{23061}{23106}What happened?
{23112}{23211}Oh, man, he promised|he wouldn't take the chairs!
{23217}{23333}How were you locked in?|Where the hell is all of our stuff?
{23339}{23394}This guy came by|to look at the unit...
{23400}{23475}...and he said|it won't fit a grown man.
{23481}{23538}So you got in voluntarily?
{23544}{23606}I was trying to make a sale!
{23612}{23691}If I ever run into him,|you know what I'll do?
{23697}{23772}Bend over?
{23850}{23978}And then Zana just let one rip!
{24046}{24128}Not that I don't enjoy|talking about high school...
{24134}{24183}...because I do.
{24189}{24241}Maybe we can talk|about something else.
{24247}{24303}I don't know where you work.
{24309}{24367}- You know where I work.|- I do?
{24373}{24460}The movie theater.|You used to come in all the time.
{24466}{24501}Still at the Multiplex?
{24507}{24576}Like I'd give up that job!
{24582}{24644}Free popcorn and candy|anytime I want?
{24650}{24682}I can get you posters.
{24688}{24755}Thanks, I'm set.
{24768}{24805}You live with your parents?
{24811}{24922}Yeah, but I can stay out|as late as I want.
{24975}{25061}They really got you guys.|Your TV, the chairs.
{25067}{25135}Your microwave, the stereo.
{25141}{25221}Man, he took the five of spades!
{25227}{25299}No, here it is.
{25337}{25384}Oh, my God! What happened?
{25390}{25522}Joey was born, and then|28 years later, I was robbed!
{25582}{25626}So how was your date?
{25632}{25712}Well, I always wanted to go out|with Chip in high school.
{25718}{25831}Tonight, I actually went out|with Chip in high school.
{25837}{25875}Honey, I'm sorry.
{25881}{25949}Not only did I get|to go out with Chip...
{25955}{25999}...I got to dump Chip.
{26005}{26075}That's so great!
{26140}{26188}What did the insurance company say?
{26194}{26327}They said, "You don't have insurance.|Stop calling us."
{26386}{26455}You didn't tell her?
{26510}{26577}Okay, fine.
{26642}{26693}Listen...
{26699}{26774}...this cat belongs to a little girl.
{26780}{26855}There are flyers all over the place.
{26861}{26919}I'm sorry, sweetie.
{26925}{27027}We can take her|back with you if you want.
{27086}{27169}But, you know, she chose to find me.
{27175}{27268}I have to respect her decision, right?
{27274}{27360}- That's a good call.|- That's right.
{27366}{27396}Enough is enough.
{27402}{27504}I'm sorry you feel guilty about|spending time with your new mom.
{27510}{27551}But this isn't your old mom.
{27557}{27591}This is a cat.
{27597}{27656}Julio the cat.
{27662}{27744}Not Mom! Cat.
{27922}{28008}Ross, how many parents have you lost?
{28014}{28046}None.
{28052}{28177}Then you don't know how it feels|when one of them comes back.
{28248}{28298}I believe this is my mother.
{28304}{28360}Even if I'm wrong, who cares?
{28366}{28472}Just be a friend, okay?|Be supportive.
{28531}{28596}I'm sorry.
{28661}{28746}I don't know what to say.
{28775}{28809}You could say...
{28815}{28907}...you're sorry to her mom.
{29031}{29112}I think she would like that.
{29346}{29430}Come here. Here, come here.
{29464}{29544}Mrs. Buffay?
{29579}{29638}Sorry about what I said.
{29644}{29720}It was insensitive of me to say...
{29726}{29823}...that you were just a cat...
{29839}{29883}...when, clearly, you are also...
{29889}{29973}...the reincarnated spirit...
{29979}{30062}...of my friend's mother.
{30079}{30126}Thank you.
{30132}{30217}We both forgive you.
{30221}{30308}What will you do about|the little girl?
{30314}{30366}Listen.
{30372}{30444}Mom, I hope you know|you still mean a lot to me.
{30450}{30549}You're welcome|to come back anytime.
{30560}{30684}If she'd come back as a couch,|we'd really appreciate it.
{30692}{30732}Come on.|I'll take you home.
{30738}{30824}- I'll go with you.|- Me too.
{30839}{30891}I got an extra futon.
{30897}{31018}Dude, you don't have to brag.|We got nothing here.
{97}{132}We are so in luck!
{138}{205}Treeger said we could have|all this cool stuff!
{211}{250}Wait right there.
{256}{349}Oh, no. I'm paddling away.
{398}{506}Really? We got all this|rusty crap for free?
{520}{666}This and a bunch of bubble wrap.|And some of it is not even popped.
{820}{907}Could we be more white trash?
{915}{990}The One with the 'Cuffs
{2081}{2130}How desperate am I?
{2136}{2229}Good thing Chandler's not here.|He always wins at this game.
{2235}{2290}I just told my mom|I'd cater her party.
{2296}{2317}How come?
{2323}{2350}I need the money.
{2356}{2467}It'd be a great way to get rid of|that last smidgen of self-respect.
{2473}{2514}I think this is a good thing.
{2520}{2612}Mom wouldn't have hired you|if you weren't good.
{2618}{2749}You don't have to stick up for her.|She can't hear you.
{2775}{2807}Do you have any juice?
{2813}{2881}Just pickle.
{2887}{2990}Funny story.|I bumped into Joanna yesterday.
{2996}{3058}My boss, Joanna?|That must have been awkward.
{3064}{3164}Actually, she asked me|if I wanted a drink.
{3171}{3278}You didn't say yes to that,|did you?
{3326}{3396}Hello, Rachel.
{3466}{3530}Well, not at first.
{3536}{3617}What is she doing here?
{3721}{3803}Last time you went out with her|you said she was a dud!
{3809}{3961}I judged her too quickly.|This time, we took it to the next level.
{4002}{4110}Last time I almost got fired.|You must end it. You must end it now.
{4116}{4167}It's not an everyday occurrence!
{4173}{4269}Usually I'm in there by myself.
{4393}{4480}Promise me you will end it.
{4486}{4554}- I promise. I'll end it.|- Thank you.
{4560}{4609}I hope you know what I'm giving up.
{4615}{4741}She's not just the boss in your office.|You know what I mean?
{4811}{4893}Sorry.|I knew what he meant.
{4985}{5033}How's the hired help?
{5039}{5096}Doing great.|Quiches are coming along.
{5102}{5175}What's this?|Blue nail polish?
{5181}{5221}I thought it was cute.
{5227}{5366}It's what your grandmother's hands|looked like when we found her.
{5381}{5438}Let me ask you a question.
{5444}{5477}Why did you hire me?
{5483}{5550}Richard raved about|the food at his party...
{5556}{5594}...but you were sleeping with him.
{5600}{5681}Then I heard the food at that|lesbian wedding was nice.
{5687}{5754}I assume you didn't sleep|with anyone there.
{5760}{5851}At least that would be something.
{5860}{5923}Oh, my God!|Did you hear that?
{5929}{6025}She hired me because|she thinks I'm good.
{6051}{6108}I didn't hear that.
{6114}{6165}She didn't hire me out of pity.
{6171}{6299}It wasn't so she could pick on me.|She actually thinks I'm good.
{6305}{6401}And hey, it's cool|if you're a lesbian.
{6733}{6857}Good afternoon. Are you|the decision-maker of the house?
{6960}{7035}Do you currently own|a set of encyclopedias?
{7041}{7135}No, but try the classifieds.|People sell everything in there.
{7141}{7208}Actually, I'm not buying.|I'm selling.
{7214}{7265}Let me ask you one question.
{7271}{7330}Do your friends ever have|a conversation...
{7336}{7481}...and you just nod along,|not sure what they're talking about?
{7568}{7685}I'm telling you,|it's totally unconstitutional.
{7728}{7818}I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
{7881}{7981}It was like the|Algonquin kids' table.
{8044}{8080}Excuse me. I'm sorry.
{8086}{8158}You haven't said anything|for about two minutes.
{8164}{8240}Are you at all interested?
{8246}{8312}Come on in.
{8364}{8397}- That's weird.|- What?
{8403}{8425}Your nails.
{8431}{8540}I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn't|give me grief about biting them.
{8546}{8667}I meant, it's weird that|you only have nine now.
{8693}{8750}Oh, my God!
{8756}{8788}Wait a minute.
{8794}{8835}I had them when I put...
{8841}{8910}Oh, my God!|It's in the quiche!
{8916}{8964}- Oh, my God!|- Okay, don't panic.
{8970}{9018}I'll go buy you a new set of nails.
{9024}{9121}No one will know,|and you'll look great!
{9135}{9256}It's because they're going to eat...|That's the problem.
{9256}{9339}Honey, don't bite your nails.
{9375}{9435}Please don't freak out.
{9441}{9520}There's a blue fingernail|in one of the quiche cups.
{9526}{9622}And there's no way to know which one.
{9641}{9747}And whoever finds it wins the prize!
{9753}{9784}I'm not freaking out.
{9790}{9898}- Why are you laughing?|- Now your father owes me $5.
{9904}{9935}You bet I'd lose a nail?
{9941}{10022}Don't be silly.|I just bet that I'd need these.
{10028}{10106}Frozen lasagnas?
{10115}{10167}You bet that I'd screw up?
{10173}{10234}All that stuff about how I was good...
{10240}{10273}No, that was all true.
{10279}{10355}This was just in case|you "pulled a Monica".
{10361}{10445}You promised Dr. Weinberg|you'd never use that phrase.
{10451}{10496}Come on.|Have a sense of humor.
{10502}{10560}You're never able to|laugh at yourself.
{10566}{10616}That's right.
{10622}{10726}My mom has no faith in me!|That's hilarious!
{10746}{10812}I don't get it.
{10817}{10858}No. I have faith.
{10864}{10944}No. You have lasagnas!
{11087}{11167}The ruined quiches are ready!
{11346}{11430}It just doesn't feel like|we're breaking up.
{11436}{11541}No, we are.|I'm sad.
{11693}{11796}Can you wait till tomorrow?|All right.
{11796}{11850}Unbelievable!
{11856}{11915}Thanks.
{11921}{12007}That was my boss.|I have to go.
{12023}{12049}What are you doing?
{12055}{12108}- I'm getting dressed.|- Why?
{12114}{12197}When I walk outside naked,|people throw garbage.
{12203}{12275}Wait.|I want to show you something.
{12281}{12310}What is it?
{12316}{12385}Just a little gag gift|somebody gave me.
{12391}{12467}Put your hands together.
{12469}{12548}You're not the boss of me.
{12566}{12632}Yeah, you are.
{12684}{12748}Saucy!
{12849}{12923}I'll be back in two minutes.
{12929}{12979}You're going to leave me like this?
{12985}{13095}Knowing you're here waiting for me.|I think it's exciting, don't you?
{13101}{13160}If you don't come back soon...
{13166}{13272}...there's pretty much|nothing I can do about it!
{13322}{13367}I brought you back a macaroon.
{13373}{13481}Great. I'll keep it in|my butt with your nose.
{13617}{13660}That's weird.|She locked the door.
{13666}{13737}You know why? She's got|the bonus list in there.
{13743}{13804}I saw her working on it today.
{13810}{13844}Swear you won't tell.
{13850}{13921}When Mark left, he gave me|a key to her office.
{13927}{14006}You want to see the list?
{14318}{14382}How are you?
{14895}{14967}Hello, Joanna...
{15021}{15097}- office.
{15103}{15157}{y:i}I'm sorry.|{y:i}I'll be a little longer.
{15163}{15224}- How little?|{y:i}- A couple hours.
{15230}{15286}This isn't funny.|Get back here now!
{15292}{15319}{y:i}- I can't!|- Why not?
{15325}{15368}{y:i}I'm in my boss' car.
{15374}{15452}- What?|{y:i}- Tunnel!
{15843}{15864}What?
{15870}{15971}{y:i}Rachel, could I see you|{y:i}for a moment?
{16110}{16172}Okay, here's the situation.
{16178}{16233}The keys to the cuffs|are on the door.
{16239}{16268}Could you be a doll...
{16274}{16379}...and grab them and|scoot on over here and unlock me?
{16385}{16510}And on a totally separate subject,|that's a lovely pantsuit.
{16529}{16602}You promised you would|break up with her.
{16608}{16744}I did break up with her!|She just took it really, really well!
{16760}{16844}Jeopardizing my career|never entered your mind?
{16850}{16883}It did enter my mind.
{16889}{17021}But then something happened|that made it shoot right out.
{17021}{17147}You got yourself into those cuffs,|you get yourself out.
{17158}{17216}I can't get myself right out of them.
{17222}{17313}You must have me confused with|the "Amazing Chandler"!
{17319}{17458}Unlock me! She could be gone|for hours, and I'm cold and...
{17514}{17545}All right! This is it!
{17551}{17593}Never see her again.
{17599}{17624}Never!
{17630}{17665}Never come in here again.
{17671}{17702}Fine!
{17708}{17791}Give me back my Walkman!
{17808}{17865}I never borrowed it.
{17871}{17912}Then I lost it.|Buy me one!
{17918}{18032}You got it! Here we go!|Come on. This is great!
{18072}{18102}Does it hurt?
{18108}{18238}No, I always see guys do this|when handcuffs are taken off.
{18256}{18328}Hello, sweet pants!
{18334}{18393}Wait!|What will you tell Joanna?
{18399}{18419}About what?
{18425}{18534}She'll see you're gone and know|I let you out, and I'll get fired!
{18540}{18585}I'll tell a lie!|I'm good at lying!
{18591}{18645}I actually did borrow your Walkman!
{18651}{18719}She'll know I have|a key to her office.
{18725}{18789}I've got to lock you back up.
{18795}{18867}I don't think so.
{19109}{19182}This is much better.
{19210}{19270}Here's somebody interesting.
{19276}{19344}What do you know about Van Gogh?
{19350}{19412}- He cut off his ear.|- And?
{19418}{19462}I'm out.
{19468}{19543}He painted that.
{19543}{19579}That's pretty nice.
{19585}{19654}I thought he cut off his ear|because he sucked.
{19660}{19733}- What else you got in there?|- Let's see...
{19739}{19832}- Where does the Pope live?|- In the woods.
{19840}{19912}Wait, that's the joke answer.
{19918}{19970}Actually, it's Vatican City.
{19976}{20063}Now, what do you know about|vulcanized rubber?
{20069}{20151}Spock's birth control.
{20166}{20253}You need these books.
{20398}{20444}This used to be your room?
{20450}{20570}You must have been in|really good shape as a kid.
{20590}{20653}I'm such an idiot!
{20659}{20730}I can't believe I thought|she could change.
{20736}{20798}Who cares what your mom thinks?
{20804}{20877}So you "pulled a Monica".
{20883}{20935}I'm glad that's catching on.
{20941}{21039}Why does that have to be a bad thing?|Just change what it means.
{21045}{21084}Prove your mother wrong.
{21090}{21194}You finish the job, and|we'll call that "pulling a Monica".
{21200}{21236}What?
{21242}{21400}If a kid gets straight A's, his|parents say, "You pulled a Monica".
{21406}{21530}A fireman saves a baby,|and they go, "He pulled a Monica".
{21545}{21635}Someone hits a homer, and they say,|"That one's out of here".
{21641}{21728}Because some things don't change.
{21728}{21784}All right.|I'll go down there.
{21790}{21909}I won't serve the lasagna.|I'll serve what I make.
{22086}{22173}My breasts are really strong.
{22322}{22435}I have to get you locked back up.|I'm so going to lose my job!
{22441}{22509}She's very private about her office!
{22515}{22565}Now I know why!
{22571}{22616}You're in trouble either way.
{22622}{22675}If she sees me locked to this...
{22681}{22806}...she'll know you were here.|You might as well let me go.
{22833}{22926}- I'll clean your bathroom for a month.|- Still won't be clean.
{22932}{23018}All I want is my freedom.
{23024}{23067}- Foot rubs for a month!|- Freedom!
{23073}{23164}- I'll put all your photos into albums!|- I want my freedom!
{23170}{23229}Why won't you hear me!|Sophie, help me!
{23235}{23312}Sophie, sit!
{23330}{23411}Would you just calm down?!
{23551}{23617}I'm going to say this|for the last time.
{23623}{23711}Would you please just...
{23784}{23886}There's a lot I didn't know|about vomit.
{23938}{24006}In a minute.
{24014}{24047}So what do you say?
{24053}{24140}You get the whole set|of encyclopedias for $1200.
{24146}{24215}That works out to|just 50 bucks a book.
{24221}{24296}$1200?
{24305}{24367}You think I have $1200?
{24373}{24412}I'm home during the day...
{24418}{24515}...and I got patio furniture|in my living room.
{24521}{24608}There's a few things|you don't get from book learning.
{24614}{24668}Well, what can you swing?
{24674}{24790}How about zero down and zero a month|for a long, long time?
{24796}{24852}You don't have anything?
{24858}{24914}You want to see what I got?
{24920}{24993}I got a baby Tootsie Roll...
{24999}{25118}...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...
{25137}{25173}...a rock...
{25179}{25242}...and an army man.
{25248}{25345}Okay, I get the picture.|Thanks for your time.
{25351}{25403}And a fifty.
{25409}{25469}These must be Chandler's pants.
{25475}{25522}For $50 you can get one book.
{25528}{25594}What will it be?|A? B? C?
{25600}{25638}I'll stick with the V.
{25644}{25751}I want to see how|this bad boy turns out.
{25800}{25923}I will buy and wrap|all of your Christmas gifts!
{25929}{26014}I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice|every morning!
{26020}{26089}With extra pulp?
{26180}{26215}I've got it!
{26221}{26273}You don't have it.
{26279}{26333}I have so got it!
{26339}{26409}There will be rumors about this.|No way to stop it.
{26415}{26463}Sophie, Monica and Phoebe know.
{26469}{26544}- How do they know?|- I called them.
{26550}{26603}When they ask me what I saw...
{26609}{26720}...I can be very generous...
{26725}{26812}...or very stingy.
{26829}{26861}Go on.
{26867}{26925}I can make you a legend.
{26931}{27040}I can make you|this generation's Milton Berle.
{27046}{27167}- And Milton Berle has...|- Not compared to you.
{27249}{27300}They're not even|touching the lasagna.
{27306}{27359}They love your casserole!
{27365}{27491}It's hard to believe|a while ago this was just ingredients.
{27518}{27578}Everyone seems to like your dish.
{27584}{27618}And you?
{27624}{27689}I thought it was...
{27695}{27755}...quite tasty.
{27761}{27830}So if everyone liked it,|and you liked it...
{27836}{27917}...that would make this a success.|Which would make you...
{27923}{27982}A bitch?
{27994}{28089}I meant "wrong",|but we can use your word.
{28089}{28148}Yes, well, I was wrong.
{28154}{28220}And I have to say...
{28226}{28310}...you really impressed me today.
{28346}{28458}You might even say that she|"pulled a Monica".
{28483}{28562}She doesn't know we switched it.
{28568}{28658}And the next time you cater for me...
{28664}{28744}...there will be nothing but ice|in the freezer.
{28750}{28794}That really means a lot.
{28800}{28889}Mom, don't bite your nails!
{29070}{29151}Hello, Chandler.
{29161}{29227}I love you.
{29233}{29301}What's going on?
{29360}{29438}No, he doesn't!
{29473}{29549}Two hours, that lasted.
{29549}{29595}So did you break up with Joanna?
{29601}{29631}I think so.
{29637}{29750}It's good you got out,|before she blew up like Vesuvius.
{29756}{29793}The volcano?
{29799}{29956}Speaking of volcanoes, man, are they|a violent igneous rock formation!
{29973}{30037}Lava spewing, hot ash.
{30043}{30085}Of course, some are dormant.
{30091}{30164}Why are you talking about volcanoes|all of a sudden?
{30170}{30195}We don't have to.
{30201}{30284}What do you want to talk about?|Vivisection?
{30290}{30348}The vas deferens?
{30354}{30400}The Vietnam War?
{30406}{30522}Did anyone see that documentary|on the Korean War?
{30541}{30580}Korea's a beautiful country.
{30586}{30654}With such a sad history.
{30660}{30739}Could there be more Kims?
{30931}{30985}- Who's out there?|- Me! Good morning!
{30991}{31035}Could you come in here, please?
{31041}{31116}Sure! They didn't have|poppyseed bagels...
{31122}{31214}...so I have sesame...|Oh, my word!
{31244}{31334}I've had a slight office mishap.
{31343}{31424}Could you get the key for me?
{31562}{31595}So sorry!
{31601}{31734}Tell your friend Chandler we're|definitely broken up now!
{71}{169}- Thanks for the tasty dinner.|- You're welcome for a tasty dinner.
{175}{220}What are you guys looking at?
{226}{287}Ross and the most beautiful girl|in the world.
{293}{374}Yeah, come to Papa!
{468}{538}I know!
{551}{598}Probably the only time|I'll say this...
{604}{660}...but did you see the ass on her?
{666}{720}What did you...?|When did you...?
{726}{819}How did you...?|How did you get a girl like that?
{825}{927}So what is she, like a spokesmodel?|An aerobics instructor?
{933}{1012}Actually, she's a paleontology|doctoral candidate...
{1018}{1079}...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.
{1085}{1176}But that's, like, the easiest era.
{1179}{1284}I've seen her at work,|but I always figured...
{1300}{1361}But I made her dinner.
{1367}{1486}We had a great time.|And we're going out again tomorrow.
{1508}{1601}Maybe her friends are betting to see|who gets the biggest geek.
{1607}{1701}Fine by me.|Hope she wins.
{1713}{1790}The One with the Dirty Girl
{2870}{2914}You have any wrapping paper?
{2920}{2974}Is it for my birthday present?
{2980}{3035}It was your birthday months ago.
{3041}{3191}You said you ordered something special|and it just hadn't come yet.
{3209}{3285}I have a call in about that.
{3310}{3397}It's for Kathy. It's an early copy|of her favorite book.
{3403}{3464}"The Velveteen Rabbit"!
{3470}{3534}When the boy's love|makes the rabbit real...
{3540}{3644}Don't touch it because|your fingers have destructive oils.
{3650}{3757}Then you'd better keep it away|from Ross' hair.
{3768}{3825}This is pretty rare.|How did you get that?
{3831}{3893}No big deal.|I just went to some bookstores...
{3899}{4005}...talked to some dealers, called|some of the author's grandchildren.
{4011}{4049}Honey, that's so sweet.
{4055}{4189}What a great way to say, "I secretly|love you, roommate's girlfriend."
{4195}{4245}It doesn't say that.
{4251}{4280}Does it?
{4286}{4388}How will it look when you get her|something incredibly meaningful...
{4394}{4497}...and expensive, and her boyfriend,|Joey, gives her an orange?
{4503}{4582}I'll make sure Joey gets her|something really great.
{4588}{4644}It's got to be better than that book.
{4650}{4725}Like a crossbow!
{4744}{4788}Once again, I am sorry.
{4794}{4857}Thank you. Bye.
{4863}{4954}I had to turn down a job|catering a funeral for 60 people.
{4960}{5034}Oh, my God!|What happened?
{5040}{5115}Sixty guests.
{5170}{5213}Why'd you have to turn it down?
{5219}{5274}I don't have|the money or equipment...
{5280}{5362}...to handle something that big|on such short notice.
{5368}{5430}Wow, what is with all the negativity?
{5436}{5543}You sound like "Moni-can't",|not "Moni-can"!
{5549}{5622}Moni-ca.
{5623}{5704}You've been playing around|with this catering for years.
{5710}{5772}- Do you want to be a caterer?|- I don't know.
{5778}{5862}There you go!|That's the spirit!
{5864}{5957}If you need money, I will lend|you money. Just get moving!
{5963}{6046}Really? I'd need $500|for all the food and supplies.
{6052}{6161}It's worth it if it'll get you moving.|You haven't worked in months!
{6167}{6191}Neither have you.
{6197}{6263}Yes, but I'm doing this.
{6269}{6357}That would be great! Thank you.
{6434}{6477}Can I borrow your apartment keys?
{6483}{6543}Why?
{6594}{6660}You can pee here.
{6723}{6794}Yes, I can, of course.
{6800}{6911}It's okay.|The duck's using our bathroom anyway.
{6958}{7006}What are you getting|for her birthday?
{7012}{7105}We've been dating a couple weeks.|I got to get her something?
{7111}{7197}You have to get her|something really nice.
{7203}{7255}- I know!|- And not one of your coupons...
{7261}{7341}...for an hour of "Joey Love".
{7448}{7517}A crossword!|Can I help?
{7523}{7575}Last week I got all|but three answers...
{7581}{7645}...and I want to finish one|without any help.
{7651}{7675}Fine.
{7681}{7807}But you can't help me develop|my new universal language.
{7820}{7845}How'd it go?
{7851}{7939}Oh, my God!|It was the best funeral ever!
{7945}{7990}Everyone loved the food.
{7996}{8053}I even got another funeral|for tomorrow.
{8059}{8118}The dead guy from today's best friend.
{8124}{8211}It's like I am the official caterer|for that accident.
{8217}{8263}Mon, I'm so happy for you!
{8269}{8342}Thanks. Check out|my new catering stuff.
{8348}{8398}Look!|I'm an omelet station!
{8404}{8467}Omelet? Made to order?
{8473}{8569}I'll have one, please.|Plus my money.
{8594}{8654}I didn't realize|you needed it right away.
{8660}{8781}You told me to go and be a caterer.|So I went. I be'd.
{8781}{8832}I used it to buy all this stuff.
{8838}{8940}I got another job tomorrow,|so I'll pay you back then.
{8946}{9039}Okay. Sorry I acted like a bank.
{9293}{9338}Would you like to come in?
{9344}{9473}Did Homo erectus hunt|with wooden tools?
{9473}{9554}According to recent findings.
{9786}{9882}Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!
{9884}{9925}Mitzi is...?
{9931}{9988}My hamster.
{9994}{10065}I hope she's okay.|I haven't seen her in a while.
{10071}{10099}Have a seat.
{10105}{10174}{y:i}Where?
{10201}{10260}Do you...
{10325}{10416}Do you have any|Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
{10422}{10490}Well, I do.
{10496}{10570}Let's go back to my place,|light a couple candles...
{10576}{10703}...break open a box|of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties...
{10704}{10727}I'd rather not.
{10733}{10808}Oh, yeah? Why not?
{10814}{10870}Don't take this the wrong way...
{10876}{10995}...but your place kind of|has a weird smell.
{11131}{11222}- Is everything in the car?|- Did you settle the bill?
{11228}{11295}I hate this part.
{11301}{11348}Look what we almost left!
{11354}{11400}That's not mine.
{11406}{11500}Look what we almost took!
{11640}{11685}Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?
{11691}{11755}Well, we're all cleaned up.
{11761}{11854}Good. Thank you.
{11901}{12013}And, well, there's|this small matter of the...
{12019}{12088}- Dear?|- The matter of...
{12094}{12142}...payment.
{12148}{12275}Jack used to handle the finances.
{12524}{12578}You know what we should all do?
{12584}{12672}Go see a musical.
{12696}{12755}Sure.
{12761}{12820}You know which one?
{12826}{12933}The 1996 Tony Award winner.
{12945}{12992}Do you know the name of that one?
{12998}{13091}I don't know. "Grease"?
{13173}{13209}"Rent"?
{13215}{13275}Yes! "Rent"!
{13281}{13316}So when do you want to go?
{13322}{13418}What? I'm sorry.|I can't, I'm busy.
{13511}{13615}Man, it is so hard|to shop for girls.
{13621}{13640}Yes, it is...
{13646}{13732}...at Office Max!
{13746}{13807}What did you get her?
{13813}{13872}A pen.
{13878}{14008}It's two gifts in one.|It's a pen that's also a clock.
{14014}{14079}- You can't give her that.|- Why not?
{14085}{14151}She's not 11!
{14156}{14256}And it's not the seventh night|of Chanukah.
{14281}{14375}What he means by that is,|while this is a very nice gift...
{14381}{14441}...maybe it's not something|a boyfriend gives.
{14447}{14478}Sure it is.
{14484}{14515}She needs a pen for work.
{14521}{14666}She's writing. She turns it over.|"It's time for my date with Joey!"
{14679}{14793}All right. What did you get|for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?
{14799}{14842}She didn't have one.
{14848}{14931}For three years?
{14955}{15021}Look, it's too late,|and I got an audition.
{15027}{15113}I can't shop anymore.
{15115}{15204}I will go out|and try to find something for her.
{15210}{15239}Thanks, man.
{15245}{15330}While you're at it,|could you get her a card?
{15336}{15411}Would you like me to write her|a little poem as well?
{15417}{15536}Or just get a card|that has a poem already in it.
{15560}{15645}- You have to get our money.|- She couldn't stop crying.
{15651}{15740}With those thick glasses,|her tears look giant.
{15746}{15776}I know, it's tough.
{15782}{15872}You know what the first thing I did|after my mom's funeral was?
{15878}{15927}Pay the caterer!
{15933}{15966}I've had a lot of jobs.
{15972}{16066}And there are some people|who always try to get out of paying.
{16072}{16135}It's either "That massage|wasn't long enough"...
{16141}{16193}...or "I don't know|any of those songs"...
{16199}{16333}...or "These sombreros aren't|big enough. Bad little white girl!"
{16356}{16399}So you think she's faking?
{16405}{16490}There weren't any tears|till you showed her the bill.
{16496}{16579}She sounded pretty upset to me.
{16726}{16816}She seems fine now.
{16952}{17027}So you just left?|Her place was really that bad?
{17033}{17122}You throw your jacket on a chair|at the end of the day.
{17128}{17256}Like that, only instead of a chair,|it's a pile of garbage.
{17256}{17355}And instead of a jacket,|it's a pile of garbage.
{17361}{17444}And instead of the end of the day,|it's the end of time...
{17450}{17542}...and garbage is all|that has survived.
{17561}{17630}- Here.|- Wow. Thanks.
{17636}{17671}So what happened?
{17677}{17731}Nothing.|I had to get out of there.
{17737}{17794}Next time, you take her|to your place.
{17800}{17888}I tried that.|She says it has a weird smell.
{17894}{17985}- What kind of smell?|- I don't know. Soap?
{17991}{18057}Listen, you like this girl, right?
{18063}{18096}You want to see her again?
{18102}{18188}So you're going to have|to do it in the mess!
{18194}{18257}Yeah, okay. You're right.
{18263}{18383}I mean, who cares about|a little sloppiness?
{18398}{18455}- It's endearing, really.|- All right!
{18461}{18569}Now you go get that beautiful pig!
{18769}{18852}I just spent the entire|afternoon looking for a present...
{18858}{18925}...for Kathy that would be|better than the rabbit.
{18931}{18952}Any luck?
{18958}{19064}Yeah, I found this great place|called "Invisible Things for Kathy".
{19070}{19140}Can you give me a hand|with all this stuff?
{19146}{19230}Just return the book,|let Joey give her the clock pen...
{19236}{19302}...and you get her|something worse than that...
{19308}{19365}...like a regular pen.
{19371}{19445}She's really going|to love this, you know?
{19451}{19513}The bottom line is,|I want her to have it...
{19519}{19600}...even if I don't get to be|the one who gives it to her.
{19606}{19677}Honey, that's so sweet.
{19683}{19737}You don't think it's just pathetic?
{19743}{19821}Oh, "pathetic"!
{19871}{19934}I've been looking all over for you.
{19940}{19960}Where?
{19966}{20054}Our place. The hall.
{20106}{20172}I got something.
{20298}{20362}It's a book.
{20368}{20432}A book?
{20434}{20528}Is it a book that's also a safe?
{20550}{20592}It's a book that's just a book.
{20598}{20690}It's the "Velveteen Rabbit".|It was her favorite as a kid.
{20696}{20755}So just let me know|if she likes it, okay?
{20761}{20785}You got it.
{20791}{20883}Thanks for doing this.|I owe you one.
{20935}{21025}There wasn't any change|from that twenty, was there?
{21031}{21133}No, it came out to an even twenty.
{21136}{21248}Wow. That's almost|as much as a new book.
{21525}{21554}You didn't get the money?
{21560}{21629}Maybe I can try at intermission?
{21635}{21697}You know what?|Let's just go.
{21703}{21757}We're not leaving till we get paid!
{21763}{21814}I don't know|who she thinks she is.
{21820}{21880}Enough is enough!
{21886}{21948}Hey, widow?
{21954}{21982}Widow?
{21988}{22062}Excuse me? Excuse me!
{22081}{22182}Thanks. Clearly this is|a very, very hard time for you.
{22188}{22265}But we provided a service,|and we deserve to be paid...
{22271}{22316}...because you ate that service.
{22322}{22424}We are not leaving here until|we are paid every penny, because...
{22430}{22558}...we're part-time caterers|and we have no place else to go.
{22564}{22627}All right. I'll get my bag.
{22633}{22693}Good.
{22848}{22941}I'm going to leave some cards here.
{22951}{23067}Please think of us|for your next event.
{23178}{23237}You want to come inside?
{23243}{23309}Yes.
{23323}{23406}Yes, I do.
{23601}{23705}I'll be right back.|Make yourself comfortable.
{24244}{24322}Guess who?
{24328}{24412}Department of Sanitation?
{24418}{24481}It's me.
{24794}{24823}What?
{24829}{24904}Oh, Cheryl!
{25412}{25468}It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
{25474}{25495}Oh, my God!
{25501}{25562}I'm so sorry.|I must have freaked out.
{25568}{25626}Thank God it's not Mitzi!
{25632}{25711}It's just a rat.
{25766}{25805}I did it!
{25811}{25884}I finished it!|I did it all by myself!
{25890}{25960}And there's nobody to hug.
{25966}{26026}Move!
{26156}{26184}Hey, you guys!
{26190}{26278}I finished it all by myself!|Hug me.
{26309}{26351}- Congratulations.|- Thank you.
{26357}{26384}How did it go?
{26390}{26486}The widow wouldn't pay,|so Phoebe yelled at her till she did.
{26492}{26581}I'm a hard-ass.
{26589}{26670}And I'm a wuss.|We should be partners.
{26676}{26779}Hard-ass and wuss.|We could fight crime.
{26794}{26838}Wait a minute, Phoebe.
{26844}{26888}We should be partners.
{26894}{26939}We should be catering partners.
{26945}{27059}You're not working now,|and we have a great time together.
{27065}{27118}I cook and you take care|of the money.
{27124}{27226}It'll be like|I have a wife in the '50s!
{27331}{27369}How did she like the gift?
{27375}{27444}She loved it.|She's showing the girls right now.
{27450}{27479}Yeah? That's great.
{27485}{27515}I got to tell you...
{27521}{27590}...I feel bad taking credit|for this, because...
{27596}{27706}...am I going to get|a lot of credit for this!
{27840}{27859}Happy birthday.
{27865}{27896}Thank you.
{27902}{27989}You know, Chandler got you|a gift too.
{27995}{28064}No, he didn't.
{28071}{28190}Yeah, he did. Look,|it's right there on the counter.
{28318}{28372}Happy birthday.
{28378}{28446}I'm sorry.
{28466}{28548}You really didn't have to.
{28586}{28729}You think it's just a pen, but you|turn it over and it's also a clock.
{28733}{28775}No, this is great!
{28781}{28852}Thank you, Chandler.
{28901}{28960}Want to go to bed?
{28966}{29055}I'll be in, in a minute.
{29141}{29216}Don't forget your coupon.
{29328}{29391}Good night.
{29393}{29487}Thank you for the gift.
{29488}{29574}I just knew that|sometimes when you're writing...
{29580}{29665}...you don't always|know the exact time.
{29671}{29788}No, I didn't mean the pen.|Thank you for the book.
{29794}{29820}The book?
{29826}{29863}"The Velveteen Rabbit"?
{29869}{29938}I have a feeling you had|something to do with it.
{29944}{29979}What do you mean?
{29985}{30034}When Joey gave it to me he said:
{30040}{30186}"This is because I know you like|rabbits, and I know you like cheese."
{30215}{30259}Thanks. I love it.
{30265}{30360}I know how hard|it must have been for you to find.
{30366}{30475}In case you missed that,|that sound was, "Oh, well."
{30481}{30560}You must really like Joey|to go to all that trouble.
{30566}{30638}Oh, yeah. He's my...
{30721}{30811}He's my best friend.
{30848}{30912}Good night.
{31098}{31213}Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
{31441}{31520}You don't know me.|I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.
{31526}{31603}You know, it's too bad|that didn't work out.
{31609}{31665}Anyway, he told me|about your apartment.
{31671}{31778}Well, I couldn't sleep|thinking about it.
{31786}{31904}So would it be okay|if I cleaned it?
{95}{150}I just saw Kathy naked.
{156}{208}It was like torture.
{214}{325}If we go to war and you're captured,|you're in for a surprise.
{331}{370}It keeps getting worse.
{376}{454}I'm in love with|my roommate's girlfriend.
{460}{577}Every time we're in the same room,|there's weird energy between us.
{583}{649}Call me crazy, but|I think she likes me too.
{655}{744}And now I have seen her naked.
{750}{800}At least with her clothes on...
{806}{923}...I could imagine her body|was covered in boils.
{931}{1020}But there are no boils.|She's smooth.
{1026}{1096}Smooth!
{1161}{1204}Could you see up his robe?
{1210}{1273}Oh, my God!
{1279}{1352}The One Where|Chandler Crosses the Line
{2464}{2508}- Here you go.|- I'll call you.
{2514}{2576}Great!
{2581}{2625}Hey, hey. Who was that?
{2631}{2685}Casey. We're going out tonight.
{2691}{2790}Going out? Wow!
{2821}{2884}It didn't work out|with Kathy? Bummer.
{2890}{2922}No, things are fine.
{2928}{3071}I'm having a late meal with her|after an early one with Casey.
{3075}{3207}The craziest thing is,|I just ate a whole pizza myself.
{3216}{3279}You're going out with Kathy!
{3285}{3309}Why are you upset?
{3315}{3354}Well, I'm upset...
{3360}{3417}...for you.
{3418}{3552}Sex with an endless line of women|must be unfulfilling.
{3568}{3653}What's the big deal?|It's not like we're exclusive.
{3659}{3703}Look, Joey.
{3709}{3779}Kathy's not fulfilling|your emotional needs.
{3785}{3814}But, Casey...
{3820}{3895}Granted, I just saw|the back of her head.
{3901}{3980}But I got this sense|that she's smart and funny...
{3986}{4076}...and gets you.
{4076}{4130}You got all that|from the back of her head?
{4136}{4185}It's time to settle down.
{4191}{4242}Make a choice.|Pick a lane.
{4248}{4308}Who's Elaine?
{4389}{4426}{y:i}Little Tony Tarzan
{4432}{4576}{y:i}Swinging on a nose hair|{y:i}Swinging with the greatest of ease
{4611}{4675}I don't know the next verse.
{4681}{4725}You could just go:
{4731}{4795}{y:i}Greatest of ease
{4801}{4854}Then go right into it.
{4860}{4917}I like that.
{4923}{4995}How do you know about...
{5001}{5059}You know, I used to play.
{5065}{5136}That's right.|The keyboards?
{5142}{5230}A little in high school.|I got into it in college.
{5236}{5351}That's when|I really found my sound.
{5367}{5500}Juice just came out of my nose,|but it was worth it.
{5516}{5550}Oh, my God!
{5556}{5639}I completely forgot about|your sound.
{5645}{5697}He'd lock himself in the basement.
{5703}{5798}No one was ever allowed to hear|"the sound".
{5804}{5872}I want to hear "the sound".
{5878}{5995}No, I mean,|I haven't played in so long.
{6001}{6059}Well, it's really personal stuff.
{6065}{6156}Play that funky music, white boy.
{6161}{6214}- Yeah, come on.|- No, you guys.
{6220}{6326}My keyboards are all the way...|Yeah, okay.
{6461}{6484}Okay, guys.
{6490}{6591}All right! Bring it on, you!
{6641}{6709}Here we go.
{6819}{6934}You know, I've never played|my stuff for anyone before.
{6940}{6998}It's important that you understand...
{7004}{7069}...it's about communicating...
{7075}{7184}...very private emotions.
{7310}{7335}You know...
{7341}{7435}You should think of my work...
{7441}{7561}...as wordless sound poems.
{7654}{7737}- That's what...|- My God, play!
{8543}{8635}Well, you know, that was...
{8639}{8702}...terrific!
{8706}{8748}Really...
{8754}{8825}...bitchin'.
{8837}{8920}Wow! It was so wow!
{8926}{8963}Really?
{8969}{9094}Yeah! I mean, you should|play in public.
{9100}{9158}Wow, thanks, you guys.|That's...
{9164}{9254}I want to play you another piece.
{9276}{9420}I left my helicopter sounds|on another disk. I'll be back.
{9429}{9556}This is so nice.|I mean, I am so...
{9621}{9736}God bless my dad|for soundproofing the basement.
{9739}{9855}I can't believe I ever let him|touch me with those fingers.
{9861}{9947}What are you guys talking about?|I loved it!
{9953}{9999}It was so moving.
{10005}{10087}It's so different|from the stuff you usually hear.
{10093}{10171}You mean, music?
{10262}{10295}I know what you think.
{10301}{10426}Yes, yes, your breasts|are just as firm and juicy.
{10446}{10513}Come in.
{10537}{10589}Oh, God! Is that "Baywatch"?
{10595}{10695}Yes, but I just watch it|for the articles.
{10701}{10729}So is Joey around?
{10735}{10785}No, he's not back yet.
{10791}{10845}Come in, have a seat.|Bow or stern?
{10851}{10904}I don't have a preference. You?
{10910}{10991}I like it in the stern.
{11021}{11094}Of the boat.
{11137}{11226}It's me. Casey and I|had a little car trouble.
{11232}{11274}- What happened?|{y:i}- We broke down.
{11280}{11330}I have to get transmission fluid.
{11336}{11424}Tell Kathy that I'm sorry|and I'll be there soon.
{11430}{11576}- Why can't you tell her?|{y:i}- I think my time is about to...
{11685}{11713}I thought your time ran out.
{11719}{11815}Me too, but I guess I do have...
{11843}{11937}Joey's running a little late,|and he says he's sorry.
{11943}{12035}I guess it's just you and me, then.
{12059}{12131}Yeah, I think it is.
{12183}{12229}So what'd you do today?
{12235}{12273}I had an appointment|to cut my hair.
{12279}{12385}- Looks great!|- And then it got canceled.
{12391}{12425}I could cut it.
{12431}{12454}Really?
{12460}{12575}Yeah, I learned at my aunt's|dog-grooming shop. What do you say?
{12581}{12628}Dog grooming?
{12634}{12721}Don't make my tail too poofy.
{12830}{12889}You have really great hair.
{12895}{12991}Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.
{13101}{13141}Joey also has great hair.
{13147}{13195}Yes, Joey has great hair.
{13201}{13344}I'm basically done here.|Let me get this hair off your neck.
{13636}{13687}What are you doing?
{13693}{13772}Checking if it's even.
{13849}{13916}Looks good.
{13956}{14056}The phone!|The phone's making sounds!
{14068}{14095}Hey, dude, it's me.
{14101}{14162}Hey, it's Joey!
{14163}{14219}It looks like we'll be stuck here.
{14225}{14323}I got the fluid.|The transmission wasn't there.
{14329}{14369}- What?|{y:i}- It fell out.
{14375}{14469}I just figured we hit a dog.
{14486}{14580}{y:i}Could you put Kathy on?|{y:i}I want to apologize to her.
{14586}{14656}It's Joey.
{14665}{14733}No, it's fine.|Don't worry about it.
{14739}{14809}Yeah, no, stop apologizing.|It's okay.
{14815}{14906}I'll talk to you tomorrow.
{14936}{15022}I should probably go.
{15340}{15431}I forgot my purse.
{15580}{15681}I really did.|I forgot my purse.
{15794}{15870}- This is bad! It's bad!|- Horrible!
{15876}{15960}Wait, the kiss or the situation?
{15966}{15998}The kiss was good.
{16004}{16060}- But that's bad!|- Here's what we do.
{16066}{16112}We forget it.
{16118}{16260}We swallow our feelings, even if|we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
{16266}{16307}Can you really do that?
{16313}{16388}I have to. He's my best friend.
{16394}{16440}And you're seeing him.
{16446}{16509}Chandler, I like Joey a lot.
{16515}{16549}But with you...
{16555}{16605}No, don't! Don't, see?
{16611}{16716}You're getting me confused.|I'm starting to yearn.
{16756}{16798}I'm sorry.
{16804}{16928}If you want to pretend that|nothing happened, I can try.
{16934}{17020}I think we have to.
{17394}{17476}Are you still out there?
{17710}{17803}{y:i}Electrifying
{17828}{17928}{y:i}Infinite time
{17934}{18017}There's a Starbucks|about three blocks down.
{18023}{18148}He's so inspired.|Just look at him. Look at him go!
{18496}{18570}{y:i}Thank you very much!
{18576}{18650}Hey, aren't you up next?
{18656}{18754}- I'm not playing tonight.|- Why not?
{18760}{18823}I can't follow Ross.
{18829}{18909}It'd be like those|poor bicycle-riding chimps...
{18915}{19007}...who had to|follow the Beatles. No.
{19016}{19095}Ross sucks.
{19101}{19182}The place has emptied because of him.
{19188}{19287}My God, he's not even|appreciated in his own time.
{19293}{19421}I'd give anything to not be|appreciated in my own time!
{19546}{19625}You suck too.
{19680}{19779}You're awful.
{19811}{19874}You guys!
{19880}{19961}You suck too!
{20054}{20170}Man! I can't believe|I locked myself out again!
{20176}{20256}Hang on, buddy.
{20319}{20369}My God! What happened?
{20375}{20442}- Did you do all this? Why?|- I sure did.
{20448}{20535}It made me feel good to do|something nice for my friend.
{20541}{20579}You're amazing.
{20585}{20696}No, this is amazing.
{20720}{20801}A TV appears from nowhere!
{20808}{20860}The dream!
{20866}{20905}How did you afford all this?
{20911}{20988}I'm 29. I mean, who needs|a savings account?
{20994}{21068}You're the best friend|anyone has ever had.
{21074}{21123}I don't know.
{21129}{21157}No, you are.
{21163}{21220}You do this, you give me advice...
{21226}{21319}What you said about|focusing on one woman?
{21325}{21355}I'll do that.
{21361}{21384}With Casey?
{21390}{21474}I'll see how things go with Kathy.|She's cool.
{21480}{21535}- Or Casey.|- No, Kathy.
{21541}{21561}Could be Casey.
{21567}{21592}No, Kathy.
{21598}{21658}Consider Casey.
{21664}{21748}I think somebody's|got a little crush on Casey.
{21754}{21820}I'll fix you two up.|What do you think?
{21826}{21966}That all the pieces of my life|are falling right into place.
{22131}{22247}You were really great.|You were really, really great.
{22253}{22303}Thanks.
{22309}{22421}Monica tells me you don't want|to play anymore because of me...
{22427}{22505}...and, you know, my talent.
{22511}{22571}Is that true?
{22575}{22627}Well, kind of, yeah.
{22633}{22723}I was trying to be really okay|and upbeat about it...
{22729}{22851}...but I just feel so dwarfed|by your musical gift.
{22866}{22890}See, but...
{22896}{23010}Pheebs, that is the exact|opposite intent of my music.
{23016}{23092}You know, my music|is meant to inspire.
{23098}{23144}If it bothers you this much...
{23150}{23273}...then I won't play anymore.
{23279}{23330}No, don't do that.
{23336}{23496}How could I live if I knew I was|depriving the world of your music?
{23701}{23794}Hey, Chandler.|Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
{23800}{23889}Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
{23918}{23947}I kissed Kathy.
{23953}{23984}Are you serious?
{23990}{24034}- Does Joey know?|- No.
{24040}{24143}Is there any way you think|he will understand this?
{24149}{24233}You obviously haven't|screwed over your friends.
{24239}{24300}Which we all appreciate.
{24306}{24400}If you'd told him how you felt|before you kissed her...
{24406}{24470}...knowing Joey,|he'd have stepped aside.
{24476}{24566}Don't say that!|That's not true, is it?
{24572}{24609}Yeah, he loves you.
{24615}{24684}Then why didn't you|tell me to do that?
{24690}{24740}I said something to Phoebe.
{24746}{24809}And I thought it was|a really good idea.
{24815}{24897}- Yeah, I remember.|- Oh, my God!
{24903}{24944}What am I going to do?
{24950}{24990}You'll have to tell him.
{24996}{25037}Why do I have to?
{25043}{25140}- Because you do.|- Yeah, I know.
{25203}{25317}Would it be okay|if I wrote a song about this?
{25464}{25520}Sambuca Margarita?
{25526}{25562}It that a real thing?
{25568}{25674}Well, we only had sambuca,|so it is now.
{25680}{25722}Listen, Joe. I need to...
{25728}{25785}I need to talk to you.
{25791}{25847}What's up?
{25853}{25925}It's about Kathy.
{25953}{25998}I like her.
{26004}{26077}I like her a lot, actually.
{26083}{26140}You do?
{26145}{26200}Your timing couldn't be better.
{26206}{26286}She's not my girlfriend anymore.
{26294}{26395}- Yeah, she broke up with me.|- When?
{26401}{26452}Just now, after acting class.
{26458}{26585}I thought she was doing some scene,|so I let people watch.
{26606}{26679}Man, I am so sorry.|Are you okay?
{26685}{26787}I've been better, but I'm all right.|So you like her?
{26793}{26854}Yes, but I don't have to.
{26860}{26961}No, it's okay.
{27004}{27116}You know why?|Because you came to me first.
{27138}{27232}I thought that would be|the best thing to do.
{27238}{27304}You might have your work|cut out for you.
{27310}{27450}When I talked to her, I got|the feeling she's into some other guy.
{27456}{27570}See, that's actually what|I wanted to talk to you about.
{27576}{27643}I think I know who the other guy is.
{27649}{27716}Who?
{27721}{27755}It's me.
{27761}{27813}I'm the other guy.
{27819}{27872}What?
{27878}{27988}When you were late last night,|Kathy and I got to talking...
{27994}{28059}...and one thing led|to another, and...
{28065}{28122}And what?|Did you sleep with her?
{28128}{28166}No, I just kissed her.
{28172}{28239}What? That's even worse!
{28245}{28332}- How is that worse?|- It's the same!
{28338}{28419}There's nothing I could do.|I'm in love with her!
{28425}{28449}Who cares?
{28455}{28528}You went behind my back?|I'd never do that to you!
{28534}{28612}I have no excuses.|I was totally over the line.
{28618}{28734}You're so far past the line,|that you can't even see the line!
{28740}{28813}It's a dot to you!
{28821}{28921}Yes, right! And I feel horrible.|You have to believe me.
{28927}{29020}Is that why you bought all this?
{29026}{29055}You know what?
{29061}{29119}I will not watch your TV.
{29125}{29168}I won't listen to your stereo.
{29174}{29276}And there's a loaf in the new|breadmaker I won't eat. Know why?
{29282}{29304}Because...
{29310}{29408}It's all tainted with your betrayal!
{29409}{29563}This apartment is empty to me!|I'm not happy about you, either.
{29679}{29734}And just so you know...
{29740}{29831}...I made that bread for you.
{30146}{30250}Oh, my God!|He's totally lost it.
{30321}{30375}This cannot get any worse.
{30381}{30491}Rats in the basement|are hanging themselves.
{30681}{30771}Thank you. Thanks.
{30823}{30892}I lost it.
{30908}{30941}I won't play anymore.
{30947}{31035}Would you...|Can you finish my set?
{31041}{31113}After that? Yeah.
{31131}{31221}No, I mean, if I can help.
{31319}{31413}Like I could lose it.
{31446}{31548}I played bad on purpose, guys.
{31569}{31622}You were playing bad|this whole time.
{31628}{31700}Just that last song.
{129}{193}{y:i}It's me.|{y:i}I know you can't stand to see me.
{199}{320}{y:i}I'm trying to apologize|{y:i}over the phone...
{464}{570}{y:i}I shouldn't have kissed|{y:i}your girlfriend...
{630}{653}Stop calling!
{659}{757}{y:i}This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock...
{763}{826}{y:i}... calling with our $1000|{y:i}daily challenge!
{832}{859}All right!
{865}{892}{y:i}What is the name of...
{898}{1013}{y:i}... your roommate who is very sorry|{y:i}and would do anything...
{1019}{1095}The One with Chandler In a Box
{2162}{2208}Oh, turkey!
{2214}{2294}Giving thanks!
{2300}{2384}Look, everyone.|It's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
{2390}{2429}Are things with Joey better?
{2435}{2499}They couldn't be worse.|I spent eight hours calling him...
{2505}{2587}...trying to get him|to talk to me.
{2593}{2619}Eight hours.
{2625}{2714}You could probably use|a plug-in telephone headset.
{2720}{2861}Should we all expect Christmas gifts|that are stolen from your office?
{2885}{2951}You shouldn't.
{2960}{2988}Speaking of Christmas...
{2994}{3088}Since Monica and I are starting|a new business and have no money...
{3094}{3204}...this year we could do Secret Santa|and each only buy one gift.
{3210}{3324}And there's the added mystery|of who gets who.
{3334}{3403}Who gets "whom".
{3419}{3505}I don't know why I do that.
{3554}{3633}I'm going to take a nap.|Turkey makes me sleepy.
{3639}{3689}We haven't eaten yet.
{3695}{3838}I know, but all that work|you're doing to get it ready and...
{3843}{3938}Did you pick Rachel for your|Secret Santa? I'll trade for her.
{3944}{4027}I picked her.|Thank God, you want her!
{4033}{4087}Why do you want to get|rid of her so badly?
{4093}{4139}She exchanges every gift she gets.
{4145}{4201}It's impossible to get her|something she likes.
{4207}{4244}Come on, let's trade!
{4250}{4314}I got her that backpack|and she loved it.
{4320}{4426}I remember she cried|when that big dog ran off with...
{4465}{4533}There was no big dog.
{4539}{4657}This sucks! I already got her|a briefcase with "R.G." put on it.
{4663}{4732}Her initials.
{4763}{4850}You can give it to somebody else.|Like Ross Geller!
{4856}{4918}You know what?|It's a girlie briefcase.
{4924}{5025}Who cares!|He works in a museum.
{5034}{5083}The big game's about to start!
{5089}{5201}Ross and Joey aren't here.|You can watch the parade.
{5237}{5325}What is wrong with this freezer?
{5327}{5394}- What happened?|- Ice just got in my eye!
{5400}{5473}People are trying|to sleep in here!
{5479}{5524}Monica got ice in her eye|and it hurts!
{5530}{5599}- Open it up. Let me see.|- I can't. It really kills.
{5605}{5705}Maybe you should put|some ice on it.
{5713}{5776}- It looks bad.|- We should take you to a doctor.
{5782}{5824}No, my eye doctor is Richard!
{5830}{5904}I can't go to him|when I don't have a boyfriend.
{5910}{5978}He's really picky about his patients.
{5984}{6048}You've got to go.|What's his office number?
{6054}{6113}Like I remember his office number!
{6119}{6192}Speed dial seven.
{6220}{6319}I'm calling on behalf|of Monica Geller's eye.
{6325}{6398}Is Richard Burke in today?
{6404}{6481}He's not in. Will she|see the on-call doctor?
{6487}{6580}She's very excited about that!
{6622}{6723}It's so cool.|Till Monica gets back, I'm head chef.
{6729}{6805}And I get to make all the decisions.
{6811}{6880}She told you to follow|the recipe exactly.
{6886}{6965}Get out of my kitchen.
{6969}{7039}I think I'm making|some progress with Joey.
{7045}{7105}When I walked in,|he went to his bedroom...
{7111}{7178}...but he only slammed the door once.
{7184}{7269}Yeah, he gave me the finger|while doing it.
{7275}{7418}I've got to call my mom and|ask her a left-handed cooking question.
{7473}{7569}I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but|I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.
{7575}{7621}You want to switch?
{7627}{7681}I was trying to trade...
{7687}{7751}...for you.
{7770}{7838}Really? That's so nice.|What are you getting me?
{7844}{7976}I don't know, R.G. I was thinking|something girlie for your office.
{7982}{8048}Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
{8054}{8158}Then you'll get stuck with Rachel,|and she exchanges every gift.
{8164}{8231}No, I got her lots of stuff|she never took back.
{8237}{8261}Like?
{8267}{8327}Like that gold necklace|I got her last year.
{8333}{8372}When did she wear it last?
{8378}{8494}She wore it all Christmas day|and then...
{8500}{8564}Big dog?
{8697}{8721}What are you doing?
{8727}{8798}Sending back this stuff|Chandler bought.
{8804}{8838}Even the TV?
{8844}{8928}No, I'll put that in my room.
{8932}{9030}Listen, Joey.|I know what he did was wrong.
{9036}{9087}But can't you hear him out?
{9093}{9196}If Chandler had kissed Rachel,|would you hear him out?
{9202}{9258}That's a good point.
{9264}{9319}How long you going to punish him?
{9325}{9386}Five years.
{9392}{9419}You've sentenced him?
{9425}{9499}Don't do the crime|if you can't do the time.
{9505}{9545}The guy's your best friend.
{9551}{9594}Was my best friend.
{9600}{9647}I don't know why|you're pushing for him.
{9653}{9791}With him out of the way as|my best friend, there's a spot open.
{9797}{9870}Who, me?
{9882}{9980}I'm honored. You know what|I'm going to do as your best friend?
{9986}{10080}I'm going to get you|to talk to Chandler.
{10085}{10133}All right.
{10139}{10230}But if you weren't|my best friend...
{10249}{10303}Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?
{10309}{10362}I walk in the room,|and he won't talk to me.
{10368}{10461}He just mumbles something in Italian.
{10467}{10569}And I know he only knows|the bad words.
{10635}{10703}Gunther, have you seen Chandler?
{10709}{10795}I thought you were Chandler.
{10808}{10899}But one of you is over there.
{11059}{11129}Hey, Joe.
{11324}{11359}I'll be right with you.
{11365}{11422}Thanks for coming in.
{11428}{11534}Oh, my God!|How cute is the on-call doctor?
{11540}{11670}So cute that I'm thinking|about jamming this pen in my eye.
{11690}{11734}Dr. Burke will see you now.
{11740}{11831}Not Dr. Burke.|The on-call doctor will see me now.
{11837}{11869}Dr. Richard Burke is out.
{11875}{11990}Dr. Timothy Burke, his son,|will see you now.
{11992}{12070}Ready?
{12195}{12272}Hey, I'm sorry. That...
{12278}{12380}- Where you going?|- My folks'.
{12390}{12427}When you coming back?
{12433}{12575}I don't know. I might stay there|while I look for an apartment.
{12600}{12704}I thought we could talk|about this. Work it out.
{12710}{12759}Seeing you two together, I don't...
{12765}{12842}What do you want me to say?|Should I stop seeing her?
{12848}{12909}It's not about her. Okay?
{12915}{12998}But seeing you together|reminds me of what you did.
{13004}{13111}I won't live with someone who|doesn't know what it is to be a friend.
{13117}{13214}I know what it is to be a friend.|I screwed up.
{13220}{13274}Yeah, you did.
{13280}{13344}And that's why I'm leaving.
{13350}{13488}If you're not going to stay for me,|then at least stay for them.
{13494}{13598}They had a very difficult year.|What with the robbery and all.
{13604}{13635}When that guy was robbing us...
{13641}{13698}...and I was locked in the|entertainment unit for six hours...
{13704}{13752}...do you know what I was doing?
{13758}{13855}I was thinking about|how I let you down.
{13864}{14009}If I knew what kind of friend|you'd be, I wouldn't have worried.
{14010}{14099}Wait one second! There has|to be something that I can do.
{14105}{14137}If we still had that unit...
{14143}{14294}...I'd get in it for six hours|and think about how I let you down.
{14410}{14475}We got a box.
{14548}{14604}I remember the last time I saw you.
{14610}{14679}It was the morning I left for college.
{14685}{14766}You were standing|outside the Dairy Queen.
{14772}{14854}Just probably waiting for it to open.
{14860}{14909}You look great now.
{14915}{14949}You look great too.
{14955}{15022}You're an excellent patient.
{15028}{15052}How does it look?
{15058}{15158}You have a scratch on your cornea.|You have to wear a patch.
{15164}{15217}Like a pirate?
{15223}{15300}If that helps you.
{15368}{15459}How long have you been working|with your dad?
{15465}{15533}Come on, one of us had to mention him.
{15539}{15618}I moved back here a couple months ago.
{15624}{15705}Big family dinner tonight?
{15709}{15747}No way!
{15753}{15817}I was going to have Thanksgiving|at my girlfriend's.
{15823}{15895}But we broke up.
{15917}{16020}She wasn't ready|for a serious commitment.
{16045}{16138}So you made her walk the plank,|aye, matey?
{16144}{16217}You're not wearing the patch yet.
{16264}{16340}I know.
{16442}{16478}He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
{16484}{16517}I know. It's sick.
{16523}{16546}Why is it sick?
{16552}{16586}It's Richard's son!
{16592}{16692}It's like inviting|a Greek tragedy over for dinner.
{16699}{16756}Phoebe, you understand, don't you?
{16762}{16859}I could see where I'd be|your best shot, but no.
{16865}{16928}Sorry, honey. I think it's twisted.
{16934}{16957}What's twisted?
{16963}{17038}Me going out with Richard's son.
{17143}{17231}It sounds like a really bad idea.
{17260}{17294}Is he okay in there?
{17300}{17361}He's fine!
{17367}{17433}If things work out|between you and Richard's son...
{17439}{17477}...you can tell your kids...
{17483}{17578}...that you slept|with their grandfather.
{17587}{17621}Judge all you want to.
{17627}{17682}Married a lesbian,|left a man at the altar...
{17688}{17723}...fell in love with a gay ice dancer...
{17729}{17838}...threw a girl's wooden leg|in the fire. Live in a box!
{17970}{18081}What exactly is the point of the box?
{18110}{18179}The meaning of the box is threefold.
{18185}{18287}One, it gives me the time|to think about what I did.
{18293}{18417}Two, it proves how much I care|about my friendship with Joey.
{18423}{18479}And three...
{18485}{18576}...it hurts.
{18590}{18668}Remember that necklace|I gave you last year?
{18674}{18727}Can I see it?
{18733}{18764}Why?
{18770}{18860}I just want to check something.
{18948}{18981}Now we'll see.
{18987}{19085}Air hole! Air hole!
{19092}{19205}Here it is. I love it.|I wear it all the time.
{19249}{19362}The necklace I got you was gold.|This is silver.
{19378}{19454}Well, maybe...
{19460}{19509}...it changed.
{19515}{19581}Oh, my God!|You actually exchanged it.
{19587}{19663}Isn't it better to exchange it|for something I enjoy...
{19669}{19704}...and can use a lot?
{19710}{19747}What did you get?
{19753}{19829}Credit.
{19853}{19937}I'll get it. I'll get it.
{20024}{20061}Hi, Tim.
{20067}{20169}Thank you.|Come meet my friends.
{20175}{20212}Phoebe.
{20218}{20248}And Joey.
{20254}{20293}My brother, Ross.
{20299}{20374}And Rachel.
{20407}{20443}That's Chandler.
{20449}{20520}How do you do?
{20530}{20584}- What's...|- Well, he's...
{20590}{20681}He's doing some thinking.
{20775}{20885}- What happened?|- You kissed my girlfriend!
{20960}{20998}I like those sunglasses.
{21004}{21164}"Like them" like them? Or "I'd like|to get store credit" like them?
{21287}{21343}This turkey is ready.
{21349}{21403}Where can I wash up?
{21409}{21444}Let me show you.
{21450}{21493}The towels are hanging next|to the sink.
{21499}{21591}And you can use the fancy soap.
{21597}{21711}Fancy soap? I thought we were|saving that for the Pope.
{21717}{21758}See. He's nice, right?
{21764}{21839}Do you want a relationship|where you can actually say:
{21845}{21945}"That's not how your dad|used to do it?"
{22020}{22083}Everything looks great.|Where should I sit?
{22089}{22132}Saved you a seat.
{22138}{22220}Sick, sick, sick.
{22239}{22277}I'll get it.
{22283}{22360}Got you!
{22380}{22461}That doesn't sound|like thinking to me.
{22467}{22487}Sorry!
{22493}{22533}You shouldn't be talking.
{22539}{22614}You've got too much thinking to do|to be talking and joking.
{22620}{22659}Okay, you got it!
{22665}{22719}Ross, pass me the yams?
{22725}{22860}Joey's got the mashed potatoes|if you want to exchange them.
{22919}{22981}Stop!|What's the matter with you?
{22987}{23050}We've got company.
{23073}{23117}Nothing's the matter with me.
{23123}{23231}I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.|I have feelings.
{23237}{23329}Okay, fine.
{23422}{23561}You can't tell, but I'm breaking|the tension by mooning you guys.
{23663}{23707}All right, look!
{23713}{23779}If this is a big joke to you,|forget about it.
{23785}{23833}This means something to me.
{23839}{23908}If it doesn't mean anything to you,|then get out of there.
{23914}{23976}Otherwise, you're just|an idiot in a box.
{23982}{24057}You're right. I'm sorry.|This means a lot to me.
{24063}{24181}I want to be friends again.|I swear I won't say another word.
{24187}{24254}- So you'll take this seriously?|- Absolutely!
{24260}{24333}That sounds like another word to me.
{24339}{24430}Are you going to take this seriously?
{24488}{24560}Okay!
{24573}{24657}Don't say that I have no sentiment.
{24663}{24734}This is a movie stub|from our first date.
{24740}{24843}This eggshell is from the first time|you made me breakfast in bed.
{24849}{24948}This is from the museum,|the first time we...
{24954}{25004}...were together.
{25010}{25152}Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,|but I keep the things that matter.
{25158}{25234}I don't know what to say.|I'm sorry.
{25240}{25372}Though you're not|supposed to take these.
{25422}{25487}It's like a million years old.
{25493}{25611}We actually have people|looking for that.
{25698}{25744}This always happens.
{25750}{25792}Here, let me.
{25798}{25870}Thank you.
{25919}{25980}You have very beautiful...
{25986}{26062}...eye.
{26070}{26124}My friends think this is weird.
{26130}{26231}I thought so too. I almost|canceled, but it really isn't.
{26237}{26320}I know. Me and your dad,|that's totally separate.
{26326}{26385}I totally agree.
{26391}{26454}We're two people|who find each other...
{26460}{26508}...very attractive.
{26514}{26586}Right?
{26809}{26848}What?
{26854}{26886}Nothing, nothing.
{26892}{26956}No, really.|Was that not okay?
{26962}{27004}No, that was good.
{27010}{27082}That was a good kiss.
{27088}{27122}It reminded you of...
{27128}{27177}Don't say it!
{27183}{27256}- It did, didn't it?|- Yes!
{27262}{27330}I know!
{27794}{27876}I want you to know how sorry I am...
{27882}{27934}Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
{27940}{28011}Well, I'm still sorry.
{28017}{28049}Is he here?
{28055}{28121}In the box.
{28305}{28384}He can't talk right now.
{28390}{28424}What's going on?
{28430}{28519}He's trying to show Joey|how much he means to him.
{28525}{28564}By being in a box?
{28570}{28636}Joey had reasons.
{28639}{28707}They were threefold.
{28799}{28911}You not being able to talk|might make this easier.
{28914}{28995}Listen...
{29200}{29346}I don't want to be someone|who comes between two best friends.
{29352}{29443}I can't stand seeing|what this is doing to you guys.
{29449}{29538}And I don't want to be|the cause of that.
{29544}{29623}I don't think we can see|each other anymore.
{29629}{29688}I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.
{29694}{29790}I'm going to stay there for a while.
{29875}{29963}I think this could have been|something really amazing.
{29969}{30079}But, you know, this is|probably for the best.
{30085}{30165}You know?
{30244}{30323}I'm going to miss you.
{30360}{30445}Goodbye, Chandler.
{30637}{30725}Open the box!
{30725}{30832}He can still catch her.|Get out of there!
{30895}{30977}We're going to be fine.|Get out!
{31025}{31104}You did some real good|thinking in there.
{31110}{31168}I mean, this is...
{31249}{31296}You could still catch her!
{31302}{31403}And Merry Christmas|from your Secret Santa!
{31457}{31580}All right, who got Chandler?|Because I need to trade.
{31669}{31718}He sees her!
{31724}{31804}He's catching up to her.
{31810}{31859}She sees him!
{31865}{31940}They're hugging!
{31952}{32026}He's taking her purse.
{32032}{32073}That's not them.
{32079}{32160}I'll go call the police.
{32189}{32270}There they are!
{32395}{32481}All right, get a room.
{123}{166}Sorry I'm late.|Did I miss anything?
{172}{266}Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos|in his mouth.
{272}{294}Fifteen?
{300}{383}Your personal best!
{463}{497}Where were you?
{503}{523}On a date.
{529}{593}I met this girl on a train|going to a museum upstate.
{599}{671}- Which museum?|- How'd you meet her?
{677}{738}No. Answer his.
{744}{796}We were at the back of the train.
{802}{882}I sat near the door|so she'd have to pass by me...
{888}{983}...if she wanted to switch cars.|She was totally at my mercy.
{989}{1071}Were you so late because|you were burying this woman?
{1077}{1133}I'm late because|she lives in Poughkeepsie.
{1139}{1220}She seems great,|but she's two and a half hours away.
{1226}{1330}How can she be great|if she's from Poughkeepsie?
{1336}{1411}That joke would have killed|in Albany.
{1417}{1476}Done! I did it.
{1482}{1564}Who's stupid now?
{1585}{1662}The One with the|Girl From Poughkeepsie
{2754}{2823}Look! They're lighting|the big Christmas tree tonight.
{2829}{2912}That paper is two weeks old.
{2921}{3024}Who keeps leaving old newspapers|in the trash?
{3050}{3113}I really wanted|to take Kathy to this.
{3119}{3203}At least you have somebody|to miss stuff with.
{3209}{3257}I hate being alone|this time of year.
{3263}{3309}Next it's Valentine's Day...
{3315}{3361}...then my birthday, then bang!
{3367}{3457}Then they're lighting|that damn tree again.
{3463}{3559}I want somebody!
{3596}{3696}You know, I want a man!
{3773}{3878}It doesn't even have to be|a big relationship. Just a fling!
{3884}{3958}I didn't think girls ever|just wanted a fling.
{3964}{4087}Let me tell you, it's been|a long time since I've been flung.
{4093}{4184}I know what I'm giving you|for Christmas.
{4237}{4333}There are nice guys in my office.|Want me to set you up?
{4339}{4438}I've been single a long time.|Why haven't you offered before?
{4444}{4513}I have a girlfriend.|I'm happy.
{4519}{4661}I no longer go out of my way|to stop others from being happy.
{4696}{4722}No accountants.
{4728}{4807}And no one from "legal".|I don't like boring jobs.
{4813}{4935}And Ross was what?|A lion tamer?
{4997}{5031}What's wrong, Mon?
{5037}{5092}Everybody at work still hates me.
{5098}{5126}I was making headway.
{5132}{5207}Everyone was smiling at me,|and then I get off work...
{5213}{5327}...and find out they wrote this|on my chef's hat.
{5379}{5514}Maybe they meant to write|"Quiet, Bitch."
{5589}{5646}What's the matter?
{5652}{5735}Fine! Just trying to be nice.
{5758}{5827}I haven't been picked on this much|since kindergarten.
{5833}{5984}And they brought in someone from|junior high to do the see-saw with me.
{6074}{6162}They're trying to make me quit.|If it were any other job, I would.
{6168}{6223}But I've waited for this|my whole life.
{6229}{6322}Wait, you're the boss.|Yell at them. Or fire them!
{6328}{6432}I would love to, but I can't.|I'm not good at confrontation.
{6438}{6468}You know what you can do?
{6474}{6552}I read about this director,|Orson Welles...
{6558}{6653}...who, at the beginning, would|hire somebody just to fire them.
{6659}{6760}Then they would all know who was boss.
{6769}{6865}I'm not doing anything.|Why not fire me?
{6879}{6939}It's a good idea.|Can you waiter?
{6945}{7006}Good enough to get fired.
{7012}{7091}All right. You're hired!
{7114}{7271}That's why I got fired last week!|Does Orson Welles direct commercials?
{7626}{7706}I say, Drew?|Are you seeing anybody right now?
{7712}{7790}I'm not asking for me.
{7791}{7846}I'm not gay.|I'm not asking you out.
{7852}{7898}I'm not gay.
{7904}{7951}I didn't think you were gay.
{7957}{8029}I do now.
{8054}{8124}My friend, Rachel,|wants to be set up.
{8130}{8188}I just got out of|a big relationship.
{8194}{8240}I'm not looking to get serious.
{8246}{8325}That's okay. A fling|might be all right with her.
{8331}{8440}Is this "Hot Rachel" that|you took to the Christmas Party?
{8446}{8512}By the way, that is her full name.
{8518}{8557}Wow! I'm free for her.
{8563}{8640}Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.
{8646}{8703}Let's talk it over|at the Ranger game.
{8709}{8776}Hold on.|I just got a box of Cubans.
{8782}{8858}I'll bring them|by your office at five.
{8864}{8963}That's a little later|than I usually stay, but sure.
{8969}{9073}Before the game, we could enjoy|some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.
{9079}{9174}I don't know what that is,|but let's!
{9269}{9412}I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.|Do you want to hear it?
{9502}{9617}{y:i}Happy Hanukkah, Monica
{9629}{9713}{y:i}May your Christmas be snowy, Joey
{9719}{9778}{y:i}Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross
{9784}{9899}{y:i}Spin the dreidel, Rachel
{9952}{9988}Pheebs, that's great!
{9994}{10096}But you know,|Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
{10102}{10217}I know, but it's so hard.|Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
{10223}{10293}What are you talking about?|Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:
{10299}{10401}Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
{10407}{10468}Maypole.
{10474}{10554}All good. Thanks.
{10561}{10647}Do you, maybe, have a nickname|that's easier to rhyme?
{10653}{10733}Didn't your dad used to call you|"Pumpkin"?
{10739}{10835}But did he ever call you|"Budolph"?
{10882}{10935}Hello, children.
{10941}{11048}Have I got the 50 guys for you!
{11060}{11101}I showed them your picture.
{11107}{11178}Guys are throwing themselves at me|and giving me stuff.
{11184}{11227}- Knicks tonight?|- Where are the seats?
{11233}{11315}Wherever! I've got 20.
{11339}{11376}Will I like any of these guys?
{11382}{11427}You know, I'm going to...
{11433}{11512}...play the field a little bit more.
{11518}{11615}Guys are signing over|their 401 Ks to me.
{11621}{11714}You work with robots?
{11844}{11948}One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.|He's nice, funny and a swimmer.
{11954}{11994}I like swimmers' bodies.
{12000}{12080}His dad made the magnetic strip|on credit cards.
{12086}{12148}I like credit cards!
{12150}{12188}I'm not bad at this!
{12194}{12256}- What does he do?|- He works in fine foods.
{12262}{12366}- You have a fine foods division?|- It's a big company...
{12372}{12483}Now, wait a second.|You make food and robots?
{12487}{12588}No, the robots just work for them.
{12594}{12651}All right, I'm going to work.
{12657}{12703}Does anybody have|a problem with that?
{12709}{12759}Yeah, lady. I do!
{12765}{12790}I got a problem!
{12796}{12853}I'll give you a problem!
{12859}{12900}What will you do?|Fire me?
{12906}{12965}You bet your ass I'll fire you!
{12971}{13049}See you later.
{13147}{13203}I should go.|I've got a date.
{13209}{13237}With who?
{13243}{13315}You know the girl|who lives in Poughkeepsie?
{13321}{13363}Not her.
{13369}{13413}This is someone else.
{13419}{13480}I can't decide between the two.
{13486}{13590}The one from Poughkeepsie, though|two hours away, is pretty...
{13596}{13653}...really smart and a lot of fun.
{13659}{13792}But this other girl,|she lives right uptown.
{13807}{13863}She's just as pretty.
{13869}{13926}I guess she's smart.
{13932}{14007}She's not fun.
{14014}{14083}If she's no fun,|why date her at all?
{14089}{14188}I want to give her a chance.|She lives so close.
{14194}{14300}And, at the end of the date,|she said something that...
{14306}{14378}...if she was kidding,|was very funny.
{14384}{14537}If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.|She's stupid and racist.
{14599}{14672}How was your first day|at the restaurant?
{14678}{14759}Damn!
{14927}{14976}What happened to your fancy jacket?
{14982}{15026}They baked it.
{15032}{15058}I can't take this anymore.
{15064}{15151}- I'm going to fire you tonight.|- You got it.
{15157}{15190}What are you doing?
{15196}{15284}You're still on fire there.
{15287}{15369}I think you got it!
{15441}{15545}Chandler, you have|the best taste in men.
{15551}{15621}Like father, like son.
{15627}{15696}Patrick and I had such|a great time last night!
{15702}{15762}This could, maybe, get serious.
{15768}{15858}I thought you weren't looking|for serious. Just a fling?
{15864}{15964}Well, you know, possibly.
{15988}{16102}You didn't tell him that,|though, right?
{16168}{16252}You told this guy that|I was looking for a fling?
{16258}{16313}- You don't tell him that!|- Why not?
{16319}{16372}I'd be thrilled if some hot girl...
{16378}{16439}I see.
{16446}{16522}You telling him I want a fling|and me putting out...
{16528}{16634}...he's so going to get|the wrong idea!
{16703}{16789}Joey, could you pass the cheese?
{16804}{16845}I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.
{16851}{16931}I thought it might be fun|to try out a cool nickname.
{16937}{16995}Hey, Dragon!
{17008}{17108}Here's your tips|from Monday and Tuesday.
{17114}{17157}There's $300 in this one.
{17163}{17221}People get generous|around the holidays.
{17227}{17345}And it never hurts|to wear tight trousers.
{17367}{17437}Could the waiters listen|to the specials?
{17443}{17548}There's Chilean sea bass|with a mango relish...
{17554}{17590}Why is nobody writing these?
{17596}{17628}We can remember them.
{17634}{17731}Because you'll make up fake specials|and make me cook them?
{17737}{17830}Sure, that too.
{17836}{17971}Forget the specials for a minute.|Here's the thing...
{17977}{18046}For the last two weeks I have...
{18052}{18142}...tried hard to create|a positive atmosphere.
{18148}{18219}Can't hear you!
{18229}{18273}Positive atmosphere.
{18279}{18379}But I've had it up to here.
{18429}{18516}From now on,|it is going to be my way...
{18522}{18613}...or the highway. All right?
{18619}{18724}Does anybody have|a problem with that?
{18896}{18942}Hey, new guy.
{18948}{19068}I said, does anybody|have a problem with that?
{19074}{19151}No, ma'am.
{19158}{19253}He has a name. It's Dragon.
{19260}{19331}You want to know your name?|Check your hat.
{19337}{19429}We did the hat, right?
{19498}{19568}- What the hell just happened?|- I am so sorry.
{19574}{19605}I was going to do it.
{19611}{19698}But I was standing there|with $327 in one hand...
{19704}{19783}...and $238 in the other.|And I was thinking...
{19789}{19875}...it's been a long time since I had...
{19881}{19973}...$327 plus $238!
{19979}{20067}We had a deal! It's why you're here.|I've got to fire you!
{20073}{20169}And I got to pay rent!
{20191}{20231}How about you don't fire me.
{20237}{20300}Instead, I stay.|I gain their trust.
{20306}{20413}They'll listen to the nice things|I say about you.
{20419}{20448}What nice things?
{20454}{20552}Nothing yet. They hate you,|and I want to fit in.
{20558}{20640}{y:i}Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica|{y:i}Merry, merry...
{20646}{20715}You know what, Pheebs?
{20721}{20773}I'm not Jewish so...
{20779}{20853}Ross doesn't decorate his tree|with floss...
{20859}{20945}...but he's not complaining.
{21004}{21053}Bad dream?
{21059}{21123}I wasn't sleeping.
{21129}{21203}What was Phoebe's song about?
{21209}{21311}It's the one with the cat.
{21313}{21392}I got to go.|I've got another date.
{21398}{21433}Did you pick one yet?
{21439}{21540}It turns out the one|from uptown was making a joke.
{21546}{21656}It was a different joke.|It wasn't that funny.
{21662}{21697}So I'm still torn.
{21703}{21750}You don't like the one from uptown.
{21756}{21823}And you're exhausted|from dating Poughkeepsie.
{21829}{21873}Just end them both!
{21879}{21942}Go to Poughkeepsie|and break up with her.
{21948}{21991}Then break up with uptown.
{21997}{22087}By the time you get home,|you're done!
{22093}{22157}You're right. Thank you.
{22163}{22261}I had a similar problem|when I lived in Prague.
{22267}{22377}- Prague?|- So much you don't know.
{22696}{22747}Patrick just ended things with me.
{22753}{22880}Did you or didn't you tell him|I wanted a serious relationship?
{22886}{22933}I did! I absolutely did!
{22939}{22978}You idiot!
{22984}{23051}I'm sure you're right.|But why?
{23057}{23163}You don't tell a guy that|you want a serious relationship.
{23169}{23213}Now you scared him away!
{23219}{23289}I am sorry.|I am so sorry.
{23295}{23382}You should never be allowed|to talk to people!
{23388}{23429}I know, I know!
{23435}{23506}Now I'm right back where I started.
{23512}{23547}This sucks!
{23553}{23613}Being alone sucks!
{23619}{23665}You'll meet somebody.
{23671}{23716}You're a great catch!
{23722}{23864}When I told those guys about you,|I didn't have to lie once.
{23870}{23927}Really?
{23933}{24029}You graduated magna cum laude, right?
{24044}{24129}It doesn't matter.
{24151}{24268}I got tickets to the Ranger game.|You want to come with me?
{24274}{24325}Cute guys in little shorts?
{24331}{24388}Sure.
{24394}{24508}Actually, it's a hockey team.|Angry Canadians with no teeth.
{24514}{24609}That sounds fun too.|Thank you.
{24697}{24789}Have you ever been with a woman?
{24822}{24875}What is the matter with you?
{24881}{25004}There is no good time|to ask that question.
{25051}{25178}The station is Poughkeepsie.|Poughkeepsie!
{25191}{25264}Ross?
{25281}{25359}Wake up!
{25536}{25601}I need more swordfish.
{25607}{25716}- Can you get me more swordfish?|- I don't speak English.
{25722}{25747}You just did.
{25753}{25830}I don't know what to tell you.
{25836}{25909}Fine.
{26107}{26175}Very funny.
{26181}{26217}Let me out, please.
{26223}{26310}Come on, I'm cold!
{26329}{26400}And covered in marinara sauce!
{26406}{26473}Let me out!
{26538}{26629}You found that handle, did you?
{26638}{26747}- It's not funny.|- Well, that's not true.
{26764}{26841}I'm a good person.|And I'm a good chef.
{26847}{26945}And I don't deserve to have|marinara sauce all over me!
{26951}{27037}If you want me|to quit this bad then...
{27043}{27081}Chef Geller?
{27087}{27138}You know that speech you made?
{27144}{27229}I got a problem with it!
{27256}{27325}- You do?|- You bet I do!
{27331}{27457}I just wasn't listening then,|that's all.
{27457}{27571}If you want a problem,|I'll give you a problem!
{27577}{27629}What are you going to do?|Fire me?
{27635}{27728}You bet I'll fire you!|Get out of my kitchen!
{27734}{27814}Get out!
{27860}{27903}All right.
{27909}{27952}Anybody else got a problem?
{27958}{28013}How about you, chuckles?
{28019}{28109}You think this is funny now?
{28112}{28238}What if I dance covered in sauce?|You think it's funny?
{28244}{28311}No, it's really good.
{28317}{28383}Take those salads to table four.
{28389}{28430}And you, get the swordfish!
{28436}{28471}And you!
{28477}{28554}Get a haircut!
{28586}{28739}Last stop, Montreal.|The stop is Montreal!
{28772}{28844}What?
{28912}{28993}I bet myself|that you had beautiful eyes.
{28999}{29094}Now that I see them, I win!
{29188}{29302}We're at my stop.|Would you like to have coffee?
{29366}{29412}Are we really in Montreal?
{29418}{29456}Yes, we are.
{29462}{29525}So coffee?
{29541}{29614}Coffee sounds great.
{29641}{29671}Wait.
{29677}{29723}So you live in Montreal?
{29729}{29854}No, but it's only a two-hour|ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
{29900}{29963}I should have thought|about my wife and kids...
{29969}{30061}...before I talked back|to Chef Geller.
{30087}{30226}It will be a lean Christmas|at the Dragon house this year.
{30263}{30325}Enough!
{30331}{30429}Lean, lean, lean!
{30468}{30543}{y:i}Went to the store|{y:i}Sat on Santa's lap
{30549}{30653}{y:i}Asked him to bring my friends|{y:i}All kinds of crap
{30659}{30745}{y:i}Said all you need is|{y:i}To write them a song
{30751}{30858}{y:i}Now you haven't heard it yet|{y:i}So don't try to sing along
{30864}{30932}{y:i}No, don't sing along
{30938}{31006}{y:i}Monica, Monica
{31012}{31115}{y:i}Have a happy Hannukah
{31121}{31180}{y:i}Saw Santa Claus
{31186}{31291}{y:i}He said hello to Ross
{31297}{31367}{y:i}And please tell Joey
{31373}{31487}{y:i}Christmas will be snowy
{31487}{31595}{y:i}And Rachel and Chandler
{31685}{31774}Happy holidays, everybody!
{56}{184}I can't believe|my little brother's married!
{215}{275}Why didn't you tell me|you were eloping?
{281}{346}Well, we were at court,|eating lunch...
{352}{401}Why were you at court?
{407}{473}Lunch.
{475}{505}We were like...
{511}{610}...we're here, we're having lunch.|Let's get married! Right?
{616}{757}A year ago, I didn't know I had|a brother. Now I have a sister!
{799}{879}Oh, it's so great.
{1012}{1082}Stop it! Don't!
{1092}{1131}I'll get you a gift now.
{1137}{1223}Is there anything you need?
{1271}{1406}We've been trying to get pregnant.|Thought we'd get a jump on things.
{1412}{1491}No one's getting any younger.
{1497}{1604}Because the thing is, we're not|able to, you know, conceive.
{1610}{1665}We've seen a bunch of doctors.
{1671}{1744}They say that our only chance|to have a baby...
{1750}{1873}...is that if they take my sperm,|her egg, put it together in a dish...
{1879}{1926}...and put it into another girl.
{1932}{2058}We were wondering|if you could be that girl.
{2126}{2202}That's a really nice gift.
{2226}{2309}I was thinking of a gravy boat.
{2321}{2392}The One with Phoebe's Uterus
{3502}{3618}Check it out!|Guess what job I just got.
{3640}{3777}I don't know, but Donald Trump|wants his blue blazer black.
{3809}{3908}Blue blazer back.|He wants it back.
{3914}{4041}You said "black". Why would he|want his blue blazer black?
{4046}{4091}Well, you know what I meant.
{4097}{4166}You messed it up.
{4167}{4248}You're stupid.
{4280}{4328}So what job'd you get?
{4334}{4400}Tour guide at the museum.|Ross got it for me.
{4406}{4483}Don't you have to be|a dinosaur expert?
{4489}{4545}They give you|all the information.
{4551}{4607}It's like memorizing a script.
{4613}{4719}On your left, tyrannosaurus rex,|from the Jurassic Period.
{4725}{4764}Very nice.
{4770}{4892}Yeah, actually, Joey,|it's the Cretaceous Period.
{4894}{4987}But I can pronounce Jurassic.
{5004}{5080}Frank Jr. And Alice got married!
{5086}{5120}Oh, my God!
{5126}{5197}They're having a baby!
{5207}{5321}They want me to grow it|for them in my uterus!
{5374}{5451}- My God!|- Are you serious?
{5457}{5577}You're thinking of|having sex with your brother?
{5613}{5678}Ew! And, oh no!
{5684}{5735}They want me to be the surrogate.
{5741}{5876}It's her egg and his sperm.|I'm the oven. It's their bun.
{5880}{5910}What did you say?
{5916}{6010}I had to think about it,|but what is there to think of?
{6016}{6095}I'll be giving someone|the greatest gift.
{6101}{6231}You'll carry their child,|and get them a Sony PlayStation?
{6237}{6296}This is an incredible thing to do.
{6302}{6366}But there are things to think about.
{6372}{6460}Yeah, you'd be pregnant.|I mean pregnant.
{6466}{6525}I know.
{6531}{6604}You'll put your body|through an awful lot.
{6610}{6690}I mean, morning sickness, labor.
{6696}{6733}It's all for somebody else.
{6739}{6796}Yeah. What's your point?
{6802}{6892}Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
{6898}{6930}I couldn't do that.
{6936}{7049}I figure, the first time I had a baby,|it'd be with someone I love.
{7055}{7096}And that baby was, you know...
{7102}{7150}...a keeper.
{7156}{7263}You were more supportive when|I wanted to make denim furniture.
{7269}{7360}If you decide to do this,|we'll be supportive like crazy.
{7366}{7400}Just think it through.
{7406}{7483}Talk to somebody who's had a baby.|Like your mom.
{7489}{7641}My mom never gave birth.|Oh! But my birth mom did!
{7757}{7856}I love this tushy!|Can I take it to work with me?
{7862}{7994}Yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway.|It came with the pants.
{8082}{8116}I am so jealous.
{8122}{8219}You guys are just right there.
{8247}{8296}Right where?
{8302}{8396}The beginning, where|it's all sex and talking...
{8402}{8466}...and sex and talking.
{8472}{8557}You got to love the talking.
{8560}{8580}And the sex?
{8586}{8641}We haven't had sex.
{8647}{8701}What's the big deal?|This is special.
{8707}{8803}I want our love to grow|before moving to the next level.
{8809}{8861}Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.
{8867}{8910}That is really nice...
{8916}{8979}...lying!
{8985}{9050}- No way is that the reason.|- Why?
{9056}{9127}You're not mature enough|to understand that!
{9133}{9220}He's right. I'm totally lying.
{9305}{9332}Then what is it?
{9338}{9394}Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
{9400}{9559}And you're afraid you won't|be able to fill his shoes?
{9571}{9661}I'm afraid I won't|make love as well as him.
{9667}{9711}I was going for the metaphor.
{9717}{9800}I was saying the actual words.
{9806}{9896}He's had girlfriends.|It doesn't mean he's great in bed.
{9902}{9974}We share a wall.
{10002}{10116}Either he's great, or she liked|to agree with him a lot.
{10122}{10270}It'll be different. The sex will be|great because you are in love.
{10301}{10328}Just go for it.
{10334}{10361}Yeah, you should.
{10367}{10459}All right. I'll sleep|with my girlfriend.
{10465}{10558}But I'm just doing it for you guys.
{10597}{10740}Now, the mastodon is from|the semi-late Jurassic Period.
{10746}{10843}Isn't the mastodon|from the Pliocene Epoch?
{10852}{10940}This is a museum. No talking.
{10942}{11003}Right down here we have...
{11009}{11082}...a large foot.
{11127}{11201}And over here we have Ross Geller.
{11207}{11256}Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.
{11262}{11375}Ross is one of our scientists.|Look at him hard at work.
{11466}{11506}Okay, moving right along.
{11512}{11582}Come on.
{11629}{11701}It's open. Come in.
{11707}{11756}- I'm sorry I'm late.|- That's okay.
{11762}{11846}I had time to finish|glazing my nipples.
{11852}{11946}You go all out|when you're expecting company.
{11952}{12023}I was working on my pottery.
{12047}{12175}Oh! I didn't know|that you did pot.
{12177}{12301}Mostly nudes. It combines|my two passions: Pottery and erotica.
{12307}{12376}Erottery!
{12399}{12446}Thanks for coming out to see me.
{12452}{12600}I thought it'd be a good idea to|talk about this baby stuff in person.
{12606}{12681}I don't think it's a good idea.
{12687}{12728}Why not?
{12734}{12780}You'd be giving up a baby.
{12786}{12828}And I really don't...
{12834}{12881}I don't know if anything I say...
{12887}{13017}...would make you understand the pain|of giving up a baby.
{13086}{13200}No, no, I understand the pain.|Don't hurt the puppy!
{13206}{13251}No, no. The puppy is yours.
{13257}{13308}I get a puppy?
{13314}{13356}But for only three days.
{13362}{13429}Why?
{13449}{13609}I realize I don't have any right|to start getting parenty on you now.
{13719}{13825}Look at me and not the puppy.|It's very important.
{13831}{13894}I know what I'm talking about.
{13900}{13948}I gave up two babies.
{13954}{14068}I only wish I had someone|who'd given up babies that told me...
{14074}{14156}...how terrible it is.
{14164}{14301}It'd be something you'd regret|every day for the rest of your life.
{14307}{14406}So however hard it is for you|to give up this puppy...
{14412}{14542}...it'd be a million times harder|to give up a child.
{14574}{14687}I shouldn't have given you|the puppy first.
{14762}{14850}Could you sit there? I'm saving|this seat for my friend Ross.
{14856}{14891}You mean Dr. Geller?
{14897}{14996}Doctor? I didn't know|he had a nickname.
{15002}{15045}Oh, he won't sit here.
{15051}{15101}Only people in white coats|sit there.
{15107}{15191}Only people in blue blazers|sit here.
{15197}{15227}How come?
{15233}{15271}That's how it is.
{15277}{15308}That's crazy.
{15314}{15439}It's crazy in a perfect world:|A world without lab coats and blazers.
{15445}{15561}But you not in a perfect world.|You in a museum now.
{15582}{15624}See that scientist?
{15630}{15753}He and I used to play together|in grade school, but now...
{15759}{15836}Peter! Hey, Peter!
{15842}{15939}It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?
{15945}{16036}I shared my pudding with you, man!
{16042}{16135}I gave you my snack pack!
{16141}{16260}See? He pretend|he don't even hear me!
{16266}{16368}Everyone's pretending|they don't hear you.
{16369}{16459}I don't know about your jackets|and separate tables...
{16465}{16501}...but Ross is my friend.
{16507}{16617}And if I save him a seat,|he will sit in it.
{16672}{16750}Here! I saved you a seat!
{16800}{16912}I'm cool here.|I'll catch up with you later.
{16986}{17057}This is saved.
{17085}{17157}Gift shop.
{17326}{17424}I'm sorry about|what happened today.
{17430}{17483}You do what you got to do.
{17489}{17628}The scientists and the tour guides|never sit together.
{17666}{17733}It's like that everywhere.|Mon, back me up.
{17739}{17814}Where you work, the waiters|eat with the waiters.
{17820}{17881}And the chefs eat|with the other chefs?
{17887}{18027}I eat by myself in the alley,|because everybody hates me.
{18045}{18095}Look, Ross.
{18101}{18126}It's no big deal.
{18132}{18191}You wear a white coat.|I wear a blue blazer.
{18197}{18284}If that means we can't be|friends at work, so be it.
{18290}{18326}I understand, you know?
{18332}{18461}When I'm in a play and you're in|the audience, I don't talk to you.
{18467}{18523}So it's, you know, it's cool.
{18529}{18602}I'll see you tomorrow.
{18640}{18749}When we're in the audience,|he does wave.
{19025}{19122}Why's Phoebe singing|to Karl Malden?
{19127}{19201}I think it's time for puppy|to go out again.
{19207}{19259}Come on, let's go to the balcony.
{19265}{19343}The street.|Come on, let's go to the street.
{19349}{19467}Don't go on the balcony|until after I get back.
{19489}{19529}So, did you do it?
{19535}{19601}Yes, yes, we had the sex.
{19607}{19646}It was bad?
{19652}{19804}It was fine, but she didn't agree|with me as strongly as with Joey.
{19824}{19937}She was like, "I see your point.|I'm all right with it."
{19942}{20031}There's not always a lot of agreement|the first time.
{20037}{20146}Yeah. Not for girls, anyway.|Guys agree like that.
{20152}{20203}Look, you have to help me.
{20209}{20236}I mean...
{20242}{20350}I know what to do with a woman.|It's always nice.
{20356}{20386}I need to know...
{20392}{20440}...what makes it go from nice to...
{20446}{20530}..."My God! Somebody's killing her|in there!"
{20536}{20651}I'll show you something|a lot of guys don't know.
{20657}{20686}All right.
{20692}{20723}Now.
{20729}{20850}You don't have to draw an actual...|Whoa, she's hot!
{20856}{20911}Everyone knows the erogenous zones.
{20917}{20966}You got one, two, three...
{20972}{21012}...four...
{21018}{21088}...five, six and seven.
{21094}{21146}There are seven?
{21152}{21227}Let me see that.
{21295}{21331}That's one?
{21337}{21400}Kind of an important one.
{21406}{21491}I was looking at it upside down.
{21526}{21622}Well, you know sometimes that helps.
{21708}{21861}Most guys will hit one, two, three|and then go to seven and set up camp.
{21879}{21905}That's bad?
{21911}{22010}At Disneyland, you don't spend|the whole day on the Matterhorn.
{22016}{22107}You might if it were like seven.
{22142}{22216}The important thing is|to take your time.
{22222}{22261}You want to hit them all...
{22267}{22322}...mix them up.|Keep them on their toes.
{22328}{22392}Oh, toes!
{22507}{22558}For some people.
{22564}{22599}All right.
{22605}{22688}You could start out|with a little one.
{22694}{22725}A two.
{22731}{22780}A one, two, three.
{22786}{22829}A three.
{22835}{22886}A five.
{22892}{22921}A four.
{22927}{22960}A three, two.
{22966}{23031}Two. A two, four, six.
{23037}{23078}Two, four, six.
{23084}{23131}Four. Two.
{23137}{23216}Two. Four, seven!
{23222}{23281}Five, seven! Six, seven!
{23287}{23382}Seven! Seven!
{23812}{23884}Dr. Geller?|There's a seat here.
{23890}{23950}Thank you, Dr. Phillips.
{23956}{23995}But I'm having my lunch...
{24001}{24089}...at this table.|Here in the middle.
{24095}{24121}I'm eating...
{24127}{24230}...right here|with my good friend, Joey.
{24236}{24309}If he'll sit with me.
{24407}{24491}I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.
{24579}{24606}You know...
{24612}{24705}...we work in a museum|of natural history.
{24711}{24761}And yet, there is something...
{24767}{24827}...unnatural...
{24833}{24911}...about the way we eat lunch.
{24915}{25015}I look around, and you know what I see?|I see division.
{25021}{25141}Division between people in white coats|and people in blue blazers.
{25147}{25237}I ask myself, "My God, why?"
{25254}{25326}Now, I say we shed these coats...
{25332}{25391}...that separate us.
{25397}{25510}And we get to know|the people underneath.
{25550}{25586}I'm Ross!
{25592}{25697}I'm divorced and I have a kid!
{25809}{25878}I'm Joey! I'm an actor!
{25884}{25987}I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
{26012}{26135}I'm Ted, and I just moved here,|and New York really scares me.
{26141}{26236}- There you go!|- Hang in there, Teddy!
{26242}{26285}I'm Andrew.
{26291}{26385}And I didn't pay for this pear.
{26399}{26455}Okay. Good for you.
{26461}{26600}I'm Rhonda!|And these aren't real!
{26669}{26747}Wow, Rhonda.
{26759}{26836}- I'm Scott.|- Yeah, okay, Scott!
{26842}{26949}I flip the light switch on and off|17 times when I leave a room...
{26955}{27027}...or my family will die.
{27092}{27131}My mom will be here soon.
{27137}{27214}I can't. I can't give him up.
{27220}{27269}Yes, no. I can.
{27275}{27316}I don't want to.
{27322}{27392}But I can.
{27420}{27526}I can't watch this.|It's like "Sophie's Choice".
{27532}{27579}You know, I never saw that.
{27585}{27662}Oh, it was only okay.
{27668}{27723}I can't do this.
{27729}{27816}My mom was right.|If I can't give him up...
{27822}{27896}...there's no way|I can give up a baby.
{27902}{27977}Frank and Alice|are going to be so crushed.
{27983}{28107}What else can I give them?|A kidney!
{28171}{28217}We were in the neighborhood.
{28223}{28349}We want to let you know that|there's still no pressure.
{28355}{28498}If there was something you wanted|to say, we'll be right there.
{28516}{28590}Who's this little guy?
{28635}{28767}He's so cute! He reminds me|of my old dog, Tumor.
{28799}{28900}You are so precious,|I'd take you home.
{28901}{28936}Why don't you?
{28942}{29003}Are you serious?
{29015}{29082}Thanks.
{29124}{29196}- What are you doing?|- I'm okay with this.
{29202}{29255}You know why?|Because look at them.
{29261}{29305}Look how happy they are.
{29311}{29417}And I made that, so you know...
{29439}{29536}...it'll be a million times harder|to give up a baby. But God!
{29542}{29644}It'll feel a million times|better, right?
{29647}{29751}I'll do this.|I want to carry your baby.
{29832}{29880}Thank you so much!
{29886}{29982}You don't know what this means to us.
{29987}{30074}I think I'm going to cry!
{30169}{30252}It's going to be so great.
{30289}{30352}- What's going on?|- I gave them the puppy.
{30358}{30461}It made them so happy,|I decided to carry their baby.
{30467}{30512}- Phoebe...|- No, I know.
{30518}{30558}We're different, though.
{30564}{30618}This is a different situation.
{30624}{30689}I am not going to regret this.
{30695}{30759}I understand all that.
{30765}{30856}It's just, that was my puppy.
{30974}{31021}Would you ever be a surrogate?
{31027}{31070}Depends who asked.
{31076}{31113}What if I asked?
{31119}{31170}Oh, Mon, sure!
{31176}{31267}- Really?|- Yes.
{31320}{31380}You're not asking me, are you?
{31386}{31465}Yes. Totally.
{31529}{31600}Thank you! Thank you!
{31606}{31631}Thank you!
{31637}{31717}Yes, thank you!
{330}{428}What the hell is that?
{460}{568}What the hell is that?|Is that you?
{698}{813}- You're really not a morning person.|- Just back off!
{850}{934}Get up! Get up! Get up!
{1025}{1076}What is that noise?
{1082}{1151}You!
{1173}{1222}It's the chick.
{1228}{1302}She's going through some changes.
{1308}{1342}What kind of changes?
{1348}{1395}The vet seems to think...
{1401}{1493}...she's becoming a rooster.
{1516}{1606}We're getting a second opinion.
{1616}{1691}The One with the Embryos
{2805}{2865}Why are you shopping|at eight in the morning?
{2871}{2907}I've been up since six...
{2913}{2991}...thanks to somebody's|dumb-ass rooster.
{2997}{3094}You should get rid of those animals.|They shouldn't be in an apartment.
{3100}{3216}Especially not with these|knives and cookbooks around.
{3231}{3299}I'm going to the doctor|and see if I'm ready...
{3305}{3435}...to have Frank and Alice's embryo|transferred into my uterus.
{3441}{3479}How will they know?
{3485}{3567}They'll just see if my|endometrial layer is thick.
{3573}{3644}I can check that for you.
{3650}{3687}Okay, think "thick".
{3693}{3768}Good luck!
{3771}{3792}Wish me luck.
{3798}{3834}Good luck.
{3840}{3919}- I'm still right.|- That is so not true.
{3925}{3950}What?
{3956}{4012}I know it's her laundry day...
{4018}{4132}...and that means she's wearing|her old-lady underpants.
{4138}{4209}I can check that for you.
{4215}{4272}You two think you know|me and Rachel...
{4278}{4332}...better than we know you.
{4338}{4397}Well, we do.
{4403}{4476}You can only eat Tic Tacs|in even numbers.
{4482}{4536}What's that about?
{4542}{4614}And you!|Ross, if you check Rachel's bag...
{4620}{4725}...you'll find a half-eaten box|of cookies in there.
{4786}{4851}You're good.
{4857}{4907}These are not.
{4913}{4995}I'm so not impressed.|Everybody snacks when they shop.
{5001}{5075}Ross, how many items|left in that bag?
{5081}{5103}Five.
{5109}{5232}Okay, ten bucks says we can|name every item in that bag.
{5238}{5272}How many guesses?
{5278}{5299}Six.
{5305}{5380}Challenge extended.
{5402}{5488}- Deal!|- Challenge accepted.
{5493}{5561}All right, we'll start with...
{5567}{5586}...apples.
{5592}{5700}We'll be starting with apples.
{5715}{5798}Stop that now.
{5808}{5831}Yes.
{5837}{5892}Okay. Tortilla chips.
{5898}{5971}- Yogurt.|- Diet soda.
{6047}{6135}- Orange juice.|- There's no orange juice! We win!
{6141}{6202}They have another guess.
{6208}{6271}Well, we won that one.
{6277}{6365}Okay. The last thing is...
{6426}{6530}Not for another two weeks.
{6570}{6592}I got it.
{6598}{6627}Scotch...
{6633}{6694}...tape.
{6791}{6850}How did you know|she would buy Scotch tape?
{6856}{6965}We used up theirs last night|making scary faces.
{6967}{6995}Oh, man!
{7001}{7064}All right! Ten bucks.|Fork it over.
{7070}{7152}Cough it up. Pay the piper.
{7158}{7209}Give me it!
{7215}{7279}You don't know us better.|I want a rematch.
{7285}{7364}And no stupid grocery questions.|Real personal questions.
{7370}{7436}And the winner gets $100.
{7442}{7477}Serious?
{7483}{7554}Are you scared?
{7560}{7624}No.
{7627}{7672}Who makes up the questions?
{7678}{7730}Ross will do it.
{7736}{7776}Sure, Ross will do it.
{7782}{7878}It's not like he has a job|or a child or a life of his own.
{7884}{7927}Fine. We'll ask Phoebe.
{7933}{8000}No, I want to play.
{8096}{8165}Looks like your uterus|is ready for implantation.
{8171}{8260}I knew it!|I felt really thick this morning.
{8266}{8362}Okay, so what's now?|Go get the eggs. Put them in there.
{8368}{8447}It'll take a little while|to prepare the embryos.
{8453}{8550}- Embryos? As in more than one?|- Five, actually.
{8556}{8603}Where am I giving birth...
{8609}{8679}...in a hospital or|a big box under the stairs?
{8685}{8793}Doing five gives you a 25% chance|that at least one will attach.
{8799}{8843}That's it? 25%?
{8849}{8938}That means that it's, like,|75% chance of no baby at all?
{8944}{8996}I was thinking,|what are the odds...
{9002}{9100}...if you stuff 200 of them in there?
{9101}{9132}Sweetie, now...
{9138}{9243}...she's a woman,|not a gumball machine.
{9273}{9389}Don't worry. I'll do this as many|times as it takes to get it right.
{9395}{9492}The thing is, we kind of|only have one shot.
{9498}{9607}It costs $16,000 each time you do this.
{9613}{9756}We're kind of using all the money|we have to do it this one time.
{9788}{9913}Okay, that's a lot of|pressure on me and my uterus.
{9913}{10030}Maybe there's something I can do|to make sure I get pregnant.
{10036}{10068}No, I'm sorry.
{10074}{10165}Wow, you guys really|don't know anything.
{10171}{10323}Why don't she get drunk? It worked|for a bunch of girls in my high school.
{10427}{10475}Do you realize that|any minute now...
{10481}{10517}...Phoebe could be pregnant?
{10523}{10572}I know, I know.
{10578}{10683}It's such a huge,|life-altering thing.
{10696}{10773}The test is ready.
{10817}{10901}Okay. Each team will|answer 10 questions.
{10907}{10998}The first team to answer|the most questions wins.
{11004}{11088}The categories are|"Fears And Pet Peeves"...
{11094}{11134}..."Ancient History"...
{11140}{11177}..."Literature"...
{11183}{11274}...and "It's All Relative".
{11278}{11307}Now...
{11313}{11434}...the coin toss,|to see who goes first.
{11605}{11698}Somebody call it this time.
{11698}{11735}Tails!
{11741}{11808}It's heads.
{11817}{11874}Gentlemen, pick your category.
{11880}{11942}"Fears And Pet Peeves."
{11948}{12025}"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve?"
{12031}{12111}- Animals dressed as humans.|- Correct.
{12148}{12168}Ladies?
{12174}{12234}Same category.
{12243}{12380}"According to Chandler, what phenomenon|scares the bejesus out of him?"

{12487}{12546}Correct.
{12575}{12630}The Irish jig guy?
{12636}{12773}His legs flail about|as if independent from his body!

{13106}{13125}Nana?
{13131}{13190}She has a real name.
{13196}{13221}Althea!
{13227}{13257}- What?|- I took a shot!
{13263}{13286}With Althea?
{13292}{13388}- Althea is correct.|- Nice shooting!
{13438}{13479}"Literature."
{13485}{13595}"Every week the "TV Guide" comes|to Chandler and Joey's apartment."
{13601}{13674}"What name appears|on the address label?"
{13680}{13761}Chandler gets it!|It's Chandler Bing!
{13767}{13904}I'm afraid the "TV Guide"|comes to "Chanandler Bong".
{13941}{13975}I knew that!
{13981}{14065}Rachel, use your head!
{14065}{14165}Actually, it's Miss Chanandler Bong.
{14313}{14403}Hello, teeny embryos.
{14405}{14493}I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi!
{14497}{14607}I'm hoping to be your uterus|for the next nine months.

{14673}{14768}...who you know.|You've been there.
{14807}{14846}They want you so much.

{15038}{15153}...until you're ready|to have them take you home.
{15241}{15326}Next time you see me,|if I'm screaming, don't worry.
{15332}{15423}That's what's supposed to happen.
{15433}{15490}Ready?
{15496}{15563}Good luck!
{15578}{15656}The score is nine to eight|in favor of the guys.

{17073}{17180}I'm so confused as to what|we've been doing so far.
{17186}{17259}How about we play for more money?|Say 150?
{17265}{17362}One hundred and fifty dollars.
{17368}{17413}Say 200?
{17419}{17480}Two hundred dollars!

{17760}{17871}So play for some pepper!|Stop spending my money.
{17877}{17901}I got it!
{17907}{17990}If we win, they have to|get rid of the rooster.
{17996}{18041}That's interesting!
{18047}{18092}No way! That rooster's family.
{18098}{18117}The duck too!
{18123}{18170}The duck doesn't make noise!
{18176}{18237}He gets the other one all riled up!
{18243}{18343}- We are not...|- All right, hold on!
{18353}{18386}If you win...
{18392}{18468}...we give up the bird.
{18507}{18550}But if we win...
{18556}{18648}...we get your apartment.
{18682}{18740}Deal!
{18817}{18882}Betting the apartment?|I don't know about this.
{18888}{18986}I have not missed one question|the whole game. I own this game!
{18992}{19016}Look at my hand.
{19022}{19100}You have the answers written there?
{19106}{19207}No. Steady as a rock.|Now are you with me?
{19213}{19288}All right, let's do it!
{19290}{19352}All right.|Gentlemen, you're up first.
{19358}{19437}You have 30 seconds.
{19443}{19495}The Lightning Round begins...
{19501}{19573}Stop it!
{19584}{19656}"Monica's nickname|when she was a hockey goalie?"

{21936}{21989}Something to do|with transponding.
{21995}{22088}He's a transponster!
{22105}{22186}That's not even a word!
{22187}{22286}I can get this! I can get this!
{22651}{22735}- I call Monica's room.|- You can't just call Monica's room.
{22741}{22787}Sure I can.|Standard Shotgun Rules.
{22793}{22888}I'm in sight of the room|and I called it.
{22897}{22944}{y:i}Damn!
{22950}{23044}I feel like I'm coming down|with something.
{23050}{23120}Guess the color of my tonsils.|I bet the apartment!
{23126}{23224}I would never bet this place.|It's too nice.
{23275}{23301}Are they in there?
{23307}{23357}Yeah, I'm implanted.
{23363}{23385}How do you feel?
{23391}{23465}Well, freaked.
{23467}{23532}It turns out the odds|are really sucky.
{23538}{23601}And this is|Frank and Alice's only shot.
{23607}{23727}They are literally putting|all their eggs in my basket.
{23738}{23770}But I bet it works.
{23776}{23863}Really? How much?
{23873}{23936}I'm going to take|a pregnancy test now.
{23942}{23987}Wow! You can tell this soon?
{23993}{24047}The doctor says it takes a few days.
{24053}{24188}But my body's always been a little|faster than Western medicine.
{24243}{24324}I can't believe you guys think|you're moving in here.
{24330}{24418}Well, believe it, baby!
{24418}{24454}Well, I'm not moving.
{24460}{24502}What?
{24508}{24590}No. It was a stupid bet.|We were just playing a game.
{24596}{24647}You can't ignore the bet.|It's a bet!
{24653}{24745}Bet on a bet|and if you lose, you lose the bet.
{24751}{24776}We have to move.
{24782}{24898}We would have made them|get rid of the birds.
{24959}{25056}I hate this as much as you,|but if it makes you feel better...
{25062}{25140}...this is all your fault.
{25146}{25166}What?
{25172}{25261}Chanandler Bong!|We steal that "TV Guide" every week!
{25267}{25332}I knew it!

{25540}{25571}Well?
{25577}{25636}Nope, not knocked up yet.
{25642}{25691}It's only been a couple hours.
{25697}{25787}Meanwhile, I'll do|whatever I can to help this.
{25793}{25913}I'm just going to, you know,|lie in your chair, okay?
{25928}{26032}Good. I'm going|to let gravity do its jobs.
{26123}{26173}Can you give me a hand?
{26179}{26287}Put that box down!|We are not going anywhere!
{26293}{26359}This is my apartment and I like it!

{26666}{26747}I tell you, you with your|steady hand, I am not moving.
{26753}{26844}And now I have got the steady hand.
{26850}{26894}- I'll take care of it.|- That's right.
{26900}{26982}You do what the hand says!
{27238}{27327}- How'd it go?|- I lost our mattresses.
{27421}{27567}{y:i}Are you in there, little fetus?|{y:i}In nine months will you come greet us?
{27577}{27688}{y:i}I will buy you some Adidas
{27823}{27929}We were just at the drugstore|so we got you a little present.
{27935}{28049}It's a lollipop|and a home pregnancy test.
{28055}{28175}Don't mix those up.|You could really ruin that lollipop.
{28248}{28383}You feel like taking a test?|There's only one question.
{28402}{28449}All right. I will.
{28455}{28517}Remember that|it's still really early.
{28523}{28639}If it says I'm not pregnant,|that doesn't mean I won't get pregnant.
{28645}{28711}Just so I don't go completely nuts...
{28717}{28822}...try not to put|all your hopes on this.
{28893}{28950}Great.
{29118}{29207}You are mean boys|who are just being mean!
{29213}{29291}Don't get mad! No one|forced you to raise the stakes.
{29297}{29356}That is not true!|She forced me!
{29362}{29422}You got the question wrong.
{29428}{29482}It was a stupid, unfair question!
{29488}{29526}Don't blame the questions!
{29532}{29635}Stop yelling in our apartment!|You are ruining moving day for us.
{29641}{29742}- Stop calling it your apartment!|- It is!
{29768}{29895}You're going to have a baby.|They're going to have a baby!
{30012}{30128}My sister's going to have my baby!
{30298}{30408}Okay, but this can't|be good for the baby.
{30656}{30704}I can't find garbage bags.
{30710}{30798}I think I saw some in here.
{30878}{30925}What is it?
{30931}{31055}I don't know. But maybe if we keep|that drawer shut, it'll die.
{31061}{31167}I can't believe we're living here!
{31266}{31294}What is it?
{31300}{31381}Did you see the size of the closets?
{31387}{31498}I can't believe we live here!
{113}{202}She's the star of the play,|and she's my girlfriend.
{208}{277}I get to have sex with the star|of the play!
{283}{398}- People can hear you.|- I know!
{548}{633}She looks great, doesn't she?
{683}{773}That is one good-looking man.
{785}{921}Is it just me, or can you actually|see his abs through his overcoat?
{927}{992}So, you been doing this long?
{998}{1138}No. You're my first.|Put the money on the table.
{1200}{1278}That's nice.
{1308}{1375}Dude!
{1416}{1563}- Is that an expensive blouse?|- If you want it to be.
{1628}{1718}Here's your girlfriend's button.
{1743}{1815}The One with Rachel's Crush
{2936}{3042}Do you still have your|old dresses from high school?
{3048}{3106}I think I have some. Why?
{3112}{3199}Maternity clothes are so expensive.
{3230}{3359}Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.|If you could just...
{3370}{3424}...throw your purses at it.
{3430}{3503}Bloomingdale's eliminated|my department.
{3509}{3543}Are you out of a job?
{3549}{3661}They stuck me in Personal Shopping,|which is a huge step down.
{3667}{3692}What is that?
{3698}{3825}Where you walk around with rich people|and tell them what to buy?
{3831}{3913}That sounds great!
{3983}{4109}We switched apartments. You can't eat|our food. That gravy train has ended.
{4115}{4174}There's gravy?
{4180}{4252}In the big apartment,|you deal with people coming over.
{4258}{4388}That fridge has to be stocked.|That's your apartment now.
{4428}{4543}- What are you doing?|- I left a donut up here.
{4648}{4706}How was Kathy's play?
{4712}{4843}Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex|with a real good-looking guy.
{4849}{4914}It was like somebody wrote down|my worst nightmare...
{4920}{5007}...and then charged me $32 to see it.
{5013}{5067}That's a good idea for a business.
{5073}{5166}I'm screwed.|They'll be hot and heavy on stage...
{5172}{5262}...then go to their parties,|and he'll try to undermine me.
{5268}{5352}He'll be like, "Where's|your boyfriend Chester?"
{5358}{5473}She'll go, "It's Chandler."|He'll go, "Whatever!"
{5499}{5576}That is a good trick.
{5587}{5649}All right, look.|What am I going to do?
{5655}{5726}They're actors.|They're there to do a job.
{5732}{5786}It doesn't mean|they'll get together.
{5792}{5860}So it happened with|Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins.
{5866}{5928}That doesn't mean it'll happen|with them.
{5934}{5999}Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
{6005}{6082}Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
{6097}{6169}Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
{6192}{6216}They're not a couple.
{6222}{6301}I get the game now.
{6333}{6473}When they were doing it on stage,|was it like really hot?
{6524}{6554}So you're fine.
{6560}{6661}The rule is when two actors|are actually doing it off stage...
{6667}{6744}...then all the sexual tension is gone.
{6750}{6850}As long as it's hot on stage,|you got nothing to worry about.
{6856}{6955}When the heat goes away,|you're in trouble.
{6973}{7104}You've been to my plays.|Have I ever had chemistry on stage?
{7219}{7293}You going to see|the play with me tonight?
{7299}{7430}I don't know how comfortable I am, going|to see how hot the sex is between them.
{7436}{7456}I know...
{7462}{7524}No, I'm there.
{7577}{7638}- Want some pancakes?|- You made pancakes?
{7644}{7713}Grab a plate.
{7720}{7791}Stay right there.
{7836}{7896}Getting closer.
{7901}{7926}Don't worry...
{7932}{8001}...we also have cereals,|muffins, waffles and...
{8007}{8137}...jams, jellies and marmalades,|which I'm sure are the same thing.
{8143}{8244}We're watching the game here Saturday,|if people want to come over.
{8250}{8298}I wanted to have people over.
{8304}{8388}Yeah? Who's playing?
{8405}{8462}The players.
{8474}{8581}Somebody seems to be missing|being the hostess.
{8587}{8717}It's a relief, is what it is,|is what it is.
{8723}{8785}Pheebs, your plate.
{8947}{8971}I'm quitting.
{8977}{9095}I just helped an old woman put on|a thong, and she didn't even buy it.
{9101}{9134}I'm quitting.
{9140}{9199}I'm talking to my boss right now.
{9205}{9250}Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
{9256}{9341}Call me when you get this message.
{9347}{9406}Mr. Waltham?|I need to talk to you.
{9412}{9474}A moment. I'm in the middle of a task.
{9480}{9573}And you have a customer.
{9632}{9661}I'm Joshua.
{9667}{9740}Rachel Greene.|What can I do for you?
{9746}{9851}I need a new wardrobe. My wife...|Well, my ex-wife...
{9857}{9958}I'm so sorry.
{10013}{10076}Anyway, she burned all my clothes.
{10082}{10199}I got away with this suit|and what turned out to be a skirt.
{10205}{10274}Well, at least that's a great suit.
{10280}{10402}It was no fun|at the dry cleaners in the skirt.
{10418}{10570}I need everything down to underwear.|If you're willing, I'm all yours.
{10601}{10639}You needed to speak to me?
{10645}{10723}No, no, that wasn't me.
{10753}{10860}Let's get started.|Let me show you my underwear.
{10888}{10977}Our selection of underwear.
{11034}{11056}I'm sorry.
{11062}{11158}- It's this way.|- This way? Sorry.
{11248}{11323}Right? There was|no chemistry between them.
{11329}{11406}Before, they had heat.|Now there's none.
{11412}{11486}You know what this means.|Joey told us.
{11492}{11606}Let's not jump to any conclusions.|There was some sexual chemistry.
{11612}{11700}It was like cousins having sex.
{11727}{11879}Here she comes. Don't say a word.|Just be cool. Don't be you.
{11893}{11942}Hey, you guys!
{11948}{12005}Thank you so much for coming again.
{12011}{12092}- Did you like it?|- Absolutely.
{12103}{12213}Wasn't Nick funny when|he couldn't get his match lit?
{12278}{12356}It's a good play, isn't it?
{12362}{12417}I loved the play.|You were great.
{12423}{12502}And Nick, ditto.
{12508}{12608}Clearly, you're having sex with him.
{12783}{12839}Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
{12845}{12940}It was obvious.|There was no chemistry between you.
{12946}{13073}You're accusing me of cheating,|and you're insulting my performance?
{13079}{13197}I can see how this could happen.|You're up there every night, kissing.
{13203}{13274}Acting. Chandler, this is my job.
{13280}{13366}I'm playing a part.|How can you not trust me?
{13372}{13480}You can understand,|given how we started.
{13487}{13538}I can't believe you'd|throw that in my face.
{13544}{13635}I don't even see you denying this.
{13641}{13714}I'll tell you what.|Call me when you grow up.
{13720}{13833}Don't expect that to happen|any time soon!
{13913}{13982}I have the best job|in the entire world!
{13988}{14125}The most adorable guy came over,|and I got to dress him up all day!
{14131}{14192}Rachel has a new doll!
{14198}{14277}I wish he was. I'd get a Rachel|doll and bump them together...
{14283}{14347}...and make kissing noises.
{14353}{14498}He's got the most beautiful name.|I never realized! Joshua.
{14703}{14737}What do I smell?
{14743}{14828}I don't know. It smells good.
{14933}{15006}Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.
{15012}{15067}Please have some.
{15073}{15179}I've been fiddling around,|making delicious treats.
{15185}{15215}The new "Playboy".
{15221}{15263}Just something I picked up.
{15269}{15383}Cookies and porn?|You're the best mom ever!
{15493}{15512}What?
{15518}{15639}Something Joshua said about|V-necks, but you had to be there.
{15645}{15696}How does Jason look in a V-neck?
{15702}{15803}- It's Joshua.|- Whatever.
{15832}{15897}Wait. Wait. This isn't take-out!
{15903}{15972}- Hate to eat and run.|- Please don't go!
{15978}{16039}I've got porn for you too.
{16045}{16105}I don't need it.
{16111}{16162}People are supposed|to hang out here.
{16168}{16211}Why? What's the big deal?
{16217}{16274}I'm the hostess.
{16280}{16347}Not those guys.|I'm always the hostess.
{16353}{16452}When I was little, the girls|brought their dollies to my tea party.
{16458}{16522}I served the best air.
{16528}{16628}Why make a big thing out of everyone|hanging out in the big apartment?
{16634}{16706}They took our apartment.|I wanted to punish them.
{16712}{16799}I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
{16805}{16890}You should have just|made them hang out here.
{16896}{16926}That's true.
{16932}{16999}This place will be 10 times|better than that place.
{17005}{17093}Are we going|to trash their place?
{17100}{17178}Steps!
{17190}{17257}Slut!
{17326}{17443}You'll all be very happy to hear|that Kathy's sleeping with that guy!
{17449}{17489}- What?|- You were right?
{17495}{17618}I confronted her,|and she didn't deny it.
{17622}{17692}I don't live here!
{17767}{17804}Wait, are you sure?
{17810}{17876}I may be drunk,|but I know what she said.
{17882}{17988}Then I went over|to Beefsteak Chewley's...
{18002}{18052}- Beefsteak Charlie's?|- Yes!
{18058}{18148}You and I|have always been...
{18521}{18605}- Do you need help?|- I got it.
{18608}{18708}I just feel bad. I never vacuum.
{18760}{18876}I was with Joshua for an hour today,|and he has not asked me out.
{18882}{18942}- It's so frustrating.|- Ask him out.
{18948}{19012}Totally. That's such a turn-on.
{19018}{19071}Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
{19077}{19150}That's the turn-on.
{19156}{19242}He just got a divorce.|He's probably nervous around women.
{19248}{19301}Just make the first move.
{19307}{19394}- I've never asked a guy out.|- You've never asked a guy out?
{19400}{19424}No, have you?
{19430}{19515}Thousands of times!
{19518}{19587}That doesn't make me|sound too good, does it?
{19593}{19647}I don't even know|how I would go about it.
{19653}{19740}What I do is, I look a woman|up and down and I say...
{19746}{19874}..."Hey. How you doing?"
{19886}{19962}Oh, please!
{19963}{20039}How you doing?
{20111}{20231}I'm going to do that.|I'm going to call and ask him out.
{20237}{20302}I can do that. Ask him out.
{20308}{20393}"How you doing?"
{20463}{20545}It's Rachel Greene, from Bloomingdale's.
{20551}{20643}I was just wondering if you...
{20723}{20820}...left your wallet|at the store today?
{20825}{20895}We found a wallet, and we...
{20901}{20995}The license? Oh, that is a good idea.
{21001}{21082}Well, let's see.|This license belongs to...
{21088}{21222}...belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.
{21295}{21430}Sorry to bother you at home.|I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
{21436}{21540}- You've done that 1,000 times?|- I've never done that.
{21546}{21602}I just got so nervous that he'd say no.
{21608}{21689}You got to give him something|he can't say no to.
{21695}{21786}Invite him to a Knicks game.|You're guaranteed he'll say yes.
{21792}{21903}- Really?|- Absolutely, and if not, can I go?
{21933}{22013}What the heck is that?
{22293}{22358}Did she call?
{22376}{22425}No. Sorry.
{22431}{22481}Maybe I should call her.
{22487}{22542}Forget her, man. You don't need her.
{22548}{22607}He's right.|What she did was unforgivable.
{22613}{22687}Well, yeah, but you know,|what if I was wrong?
{22693}{22732}How might you be wrong?
{22738}{22807}What if she didn't actually|sleep with the guy?
{22813}{22849}Tell me she told you this.
{22855}{22931}She didn't have to.|I saw the play. There was no heat.
{22937}{22983}- Back me up.|- That's your basis?
{22989}{23031}That's not backing me up!
{23037}{23123}Look, you said,|with the offstage and the heat...
{23129}{23232}That was just a theory.|A lot of theories didn't pan out.
{23238}{23362}Lone gunman, communism, geometry.
{23368}{23453}Oh, my God!
{23483}{23564}"Would you like to go|to a basketball game with..."
{23570}{23693}"It's funny, basketball,|because I happen to have tickets..."
{23772}{23849}"Who likes the Knicks?"
{23888}{23942}What do you think?
{23948}{24075}Well, as a single woman,|who is available...
{24081}{24168}...I think you look great.
{24186}{24287}Oh, yeah, you look great.
{24393}{24464}This looks great.
{24476}{24497}So you like it?
{24503}{24581}I do. I love it.|In fact, I think I'll wear it home.
{24587}{24690}- Great.|- Thank you so much for all your help.
{24696}{24779}Well, I guess this is it.
{24785}{24811}Thanks.
{24817}{24883}I'll see you in the spring|for the bathing suits.
{24889}{24960}You don't want to do that now?
{24966}{25007}That's okay.
{25013}{25060}I'll see you around sometime.
{25066}{25133}Basketball!
{25145}{25202}Sorry?
{25213}{25287}I have two tickets|to the Knicks game tonight...
{25293}{25388}...just as a thank-you for this week.
{25403}{25443}That would be great!
{25449}{25499}- Really?|- That would be fantastic!
{25505}{25617}My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!
{25623}{25704}This is fantastic.|Thank you so much, Rachel.
{25710}{25778}Good morning.
{26010}{26090}I just wanted to come over|to say that I'm sorry.
{26096}{26162}I acted like the biggest idiot|in the world.
{26168}{26268}I can completely understand|why you were so upset.
{26303}{26339}I wish you'd called me.
{26345}{26410}Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.
{26416}{26472}I think this is a good thing.
{26478}{26547}We've had our first fight,|and now we can move on.
{26553}{26648}I know for me, but...
{26771}{26846}Nick's pants?
{26910}{27037}I think our second fight|is going to be a big one!
{27149}{27232}- For next time, what do you say?|- "I have an extra ticket."
{27238}{27352}"An extra ticket."|Not "two tickets".
{27373}{27497}The first time you asked a guy out|he turned you down?
{27512}{27582}He didn't turn me down.|He's at the game.
{27588}{27669}I got the date.|I'm just not on it.
{27728}{27796}Okay, it's ready.
{27802}{27825}Come on.
{27831}{27860}What's ready?
{27866}{27923}Just come.
{27987}{28073}Oh, my God!
{28074}{28124}This is beautiful!
{28130}{28236}Did you work for two days straight?
{28242}{28295}Pretty much.
{28301}{28354}What do you think of the floor?
{28360}{28411}I don't know.|Looks the same.
{28417}{28487}You used to have carpet.
{28518}{28571}I made snacks.
{28577}{28606}Please, just hang out.
{28612}{28718}I'm going to rest my eyes|for just a bit.
{28720}{28762}Do you want us to come back later?
{28768}{28870}No, no, no. Stay.|Just keep talking.
{28876}{28989}I'm always the hostess.
{29015}{29047}How'd it go?
{29053}{29110}- She wasn't sleeping with him.|- Good!
{29116}{29198}She is now.
{29218}{29347}- What are you saying?|- I'm saying that she is a devil woman.
{29353}{29445}You know a person, then they|turn around and sleep with Nick.
{29451}{29567}Nick and his rock-hard pecs|and his giant man-nipples.
{29606}{29674}I hate him.|And I hate her.
{29680}{29792}I don't hate her. I love her.|This is all my fault.
{29798}{29870}How? How is it your fault?
{29876}{29901}I should have called.
{29907}{29992}If I'd called her, she never|would have gone out with Nick.
{29998}{30146}They wouldn't have ended up in bed.|I threw her at his man-nipples!
{30168}{30205}This is not your fault.
{30211}{30358}Your fight does not|justify her sleeping with someone.
{30372}{30473}Well, if she thought|they were on a break...
{30608}{30749}One of your customers left|his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.
{30755}{30888}- Will you call him?|- Yes, I will. Absolutely.
{31191}{31234}Hello, Rachel.
{31240}{31285}Hi, Joshua.
{31291}{31380}- I left my wallet here on purpose.|- Really?
{31386}{31440}I just wanted to see you again.
{31446}{31499}Oh, I'm glad.
{31505}{31613}Rachel, I'd like to say|something to you.
{31632}{31718}How you doing?
{82}{116}So what is this?
{122}{177}Googlie Worm.
{183}{209}And this?
{215}{279}Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.
{285}{376}It's so funny!
{377}{421}What's this?
{427}{502}A hunk of sandwich from last year.
{508}{620}Geller's got one hooked!|Looks like a big one!
{626}{729}It's the classic struggle|between man...
{762}{841}Someone knocked over a lamp.
{847}{916}You know what'll be great|about the fishing trip?
{922}{1010}When my Dad asks, "What are you|doing with your life?"...
{1016}{1094}...I can say, "I'm doing a movie|with Charlton Heston."
{1100}{1172}"What about you?"
{1250}{1316}Don't stop having fun|just because I'm here.
{1322}{1417}Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.
{1426}{1512}Well, except you.
{1687}{1798}You shouldn't leave Chandler alone.|They broke up only two days ago.
{1804}{1846}Go fishing next week.
{1852}{1916}There's nothing I can do.|He's still in his sweats.
{1922}{2007}That's only phase one.
{2007}{2090}I'll be back for phase two.|I'd never miss that.
{2096}{2121}Phase two?
{2127}{2221}Getting drunk|and going to a strip club.
{2227}{2285}How does going there|make him better?
{2291}{2349}There are naked ladies there.
{2355}{2421}Then to phase three:|Seeing yourself with other women.
{2427}{2522}There are naked ladies there too.
{2534}{2637}Would you give me one minute, please?
{2644}{2718}The One with Joey's Dirty Day
{3841}{3931}These match the jacket|you picked out last week?
{3937}{4001}There we go.
{4007}{4065}There it is.
{4071}{4120}You know what I need?|Gloves.
{4126}{4185}Brown leather dress gloves.
{4191}{4235}Well, let's see...
{4241}{4273}This one is large.
{4279}{4326}And this one...
{4332}{4386}Also a large?
{4392}{4482}Two larges coming right up.
{4517}{4561}Could I have a moment?
{4567}{4646}My niece, you see,|is in town from London.
{4652}{4691}Shropshire, but you know.
{4697}{4746}She's about your age, I'd say.
{4752}{4844}Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.|{y:i}Die Fledermaus.
{4850}{4907}Would you like to keep her|company tonight?
{4913}{4949}Sure. You got it!
{4955}{5026}Count me in. Me.|"Fledermaus." Great!
{5032}{5137}Yes, of course.|Thank you so very much.
{5144}{5211}So?
{5367}{5431}- Gloves?|- Sorry, I'll be right back.
{5437}{5488}Actually, I got to take off.
{5494}{5571}I was curious.|Do you have plans tonight?
{5577}{5615}No, nothing!
{5621}{5691}I invested in a nightclub.|It opens tonight. Want to come?
{5697}{5743}That would be great!
{5749}{5847}You're into hard-core S and M, right?
{5862}{5883}Well, I guess.
{5889}{5962}I'm kidding.
{5974}{6055}I'll put you on the V.I.P. List.|Look for me.
{6061}{6085}Great! You bet.
{6091}{6167}I'll see you tonight.
{6167}{6226}- I almost forgot the tickets.|- What?
{6232}{6360}For you and Emily. Tonight.|{y:i}Die Fledermaus.
{6366}{6389}Oh, right.
{6395}{6512}You'll like it.|It has two out of the three tenors.
{6649}{6700}I can't believe|Kathy did this to me.
{6706}{6763}I really thought she was the one.
{6769}{6796}I'll tell you what.
{6802}{6865}I'm not getting out|of this chair. Ever!
{6871}{6940}From now on, this chair is the one!
{6946}{7026}You know what else is the one?|My sweatpants.
{7032}{7106}Just take the sweats off, okay?
{7112}{7206}Take them off|and we'll have some fun.
{7305}{7337}Did you catch any fish?
{7343}{7389}You guys have no idea.
{7395}{7458}- You stink!|- Are you kidding?
{7464}{7619}Three days without a shower.|Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!
{7634}{7660}How's he doing?
{7666}{7725}He hasn't left|that chair in two days.
{7731}{7817}Hey, buddy, how's it going?
{7921}{7991}You see? He just needed|his pal to come home.
{7997}{8043}I got to memorize my lines.
{8049}{8175}Me and Charlton Heston,|bright and early tomorrow, baby!
{8265}{8328}What's the matter?
{8334}{8450}Joshua invited me to this|fancy club opening tonight.
{8456}{8505}But I already told Mr. Waltham...
{8511}{8620}...that I would take his niece|to the dumb old opera.
{8626}{8707}So what are you going to do?
{8709}{8770}- I don't know.|- No! Help me!
{8776}{8838}- I can't. I have to work.|- Phoebe?
{8844}{8928}I would, but I get|my morning sickness in the evening.
{8934}{9031}Unless she wants to spend the night|holding my hair back for me.
{9037}{9101}You guys, come on!|I have to meet Joshua.
{9107}{9170}It's my chance for him|to see the "fun" Rachel.
{9176}{9308}The "wouldn't it be great|if she were my wife?" Rachel.
{9314}{9362}Are Joey and Chandler back?
{9368}{9508}Chandler's still in phase one,|and Joey's that thing you smell.
{9745}{9813}So...
{9882}{9951}Come on!
{9957}{9989}- She's here.|- Wait, wait.
{9995}{10041}Ross, please?
{10047}{10139}You want me to take some girl|I've never met to the opera...
{10145}{10240}...so you can go to a club|and flirt with some guy?
{10246}{10299}That is a toughie.
{10305}{10373}She's looking down the hall.
{10379}{10428}She looked right at me.
{10434}{10547}You can't see people|through that hole, can you?
{10666}{10726}I'll be right there!|Okay, Ross, please.
{10732}{10768}I thought we had moved on.
{10774}{10843}I thought we could be happy|for each other.
{10849}{10926}I mean, was that just me?
{10932}{10960}All right, I'll do it.
{10966}{11033}Thank you, thank you.
{11039}{11085}Emily.
{11091}{11120}I'm Rachel.
{11126}{11163}Thank goodness!
{11169}{11262}There's been a teeny change of plans.|I'm not free tonight...
{11268}{11319}Really?
{11325}{11425}I must've missed your call, though|I didn't leave the flat all day.
{11431}{11456}Well, I...
{11462}{11526}That's not rude.|It's in keeping with the trip...
{11532}{11620}...where I've been run down|by one of your wiener carts...
{11626}{11689}...and been strip-searched|at the airport.
{11695}{11852}Apparently, I look like someone who's|got cocaine stuffed up their bum.
{11877}{11956}I think you look great.
{11962}{12063}Good night.|It was very nice to meet you.
{12111}{12158}I'll get her.
{12164}{12242}Please, hurry.
{12244}{12347}Don't you just love|the way they talk?
{12550}{12635}- What?|- The baby kicked!
{12640}{12762}No, wait. The elastic|in my underwear busted.
{12768}{12820}Oh, my God! I overslept!
{12826}{12905}I was supposed to be|on the set half an hour ago!
{12911}{12965}You can't go like that!|You stink!
{12971}{13038}I fell asleep.|Now I don't have time!
{13044}{13100}Just 10 blocks away.|If I run, I'll make it.
{13106}{13178}Run 10 blocks.|That'll help the smell.
{13184}{13249}Slow down!|No, keep moving.
{13255}{13301}How did it go last night?
{13307}{13376}Well, I didn't see Joshua.
{13382}{13450}But I did punch a girl in the face.
{13456}{13520}The whole night was horrible.|It was pouring.
{13526}{13641}There was no Rachel Greene on the list.|But there was a Rachel Greep.
{13647}{13747}So did you get to meet her?
{13765}{13851}There is no Rachel Greep.|But this girl overheard us.
{13857}{13937}And she said, "I'm Rachel Greep!"|And he let her in.
{13943}{13975}So you hit her?
{13981}{14014}No, she was already in.
{14020}{14089}This big bitch behind me|tried to steal my umbrella...
{14095}{14165}...so I clocked her.
{14171}{14230}All I wanted was a few hours...
{14236}{14306}...outside of work to see Joshua...
{14312}{14437}...so he could go ahead and|start falling in love with me.
{14467}{14542}Pheebs.
{14552}{14621}Honey, that's your name.
{14627}{14763}That's short for Phoebe? I thought|that's what we called each other.
{14799}{14850}- You're wearing pants!|- That's right.
{14856}{14955}Where are the guys? I'm ready|to get drunk and see strippers.
{14961}{14986}It's 9:30 a.m.
{14992}{15077}They got a breakfast buffet.
{15148}{15169}Let me talk to him!
{15175}{15230}- Oh, my God!|- Can't I just...
{15236}{15290}- It's my phone and she's shush...|- Please!
{15296}{15336}What's he saying?
{15342}{15396}He's with Emily in Vermont.
{15402}{15443}What? Oh, my God!
{15449}{15515}Who's Emily?
{15600}{15695}They're in Vermont?|How did this happen?
{15701}{15773}How'd he end up in Vermont|with that witch?
{15779}{15866}Maybe she doesn't hit him|all the time.
{15872}{15893}{y:i}When we met her...
{15899}{15991}...she was soaking, her feet were wet.|Who wouldn't be miserable?
{15997}{16099}With a dry pair of shoes,|she was a totally different person.
{16105}{16185}There's a deer outside|eating fruit from the orchard!
{16191}{16322}I got to go! There's a deer|eating fruit from the orchard!
{16346}{16472}He had to go. There was a deer|eating fruit from the orchard.
{16474}{16525}I don't get this.|She was horrible!
{16531}{16617}I'm going to go stand over there.
{16625}{16669}Why do you care?
{16675}{16746}I don't care.
{16752}{16831}I'm just upset that|I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.
{16837}{16933}You do not just meet someone|and go flitting off to Vermont!
{16939}{17021}When you first met Barry,|you flitted off to Vail.
{17027}{17079}Could you, just for once...
{17085}{17192}...not remember every little thing?
{17207}{17267}So you know, when's he getting back?
{17273}{17298}A couple of days.
{17304}{17364}I knew something|like this would happen.
{17370}{17443}What are you doing?
{17457}{17500}You can't go back a phase!
{17506}{17622}You're thinking about time.|You can't go back in time.
{17635}{17740}Why don't you do your phase two|strip club thing with us?
{17746}{17785}We can be guys!
{17791}{17846}No, you can't.
{17852}{17916}Let us be guys!|Maybe we want to be guys.
{17922}{18036}No, you don't. You'd be all|hairy and wouldn't live as long.
{18042}{18145}Would you just stop being|such a wuss and get those off?
{18151}{18257}And come with us|and watch naked girls dance!
{18334}{18412}I'm sorry.
{18496}{18538}Joey Tribbianni.|I'm here.
{18544}{18652}Calm down, we got time.|We're running late.
{18799}{18889}Look at that.|Charlton Heston eating licorice.
{18895}{19024}Yeah, he loves them.|I've never seen him with...
{19076}{19154}What the hell is that?|What smells so bad?
{19160}{19206}You.
{19212}{19327}I could see why you would think that.|But you know who it is?
{19333}{19364}You?
{19370}{19459}No, no. It's Heston.
{19486}{19505}What?
{19511}{19630}He reeks like he went on a three-day|fishing trip, then ate licorice.
{19636}{19740}No way. He's the only one|with a shower in his dressing room.
{19746}{19788}Really? A shower?
{19794}{19854}Which room might that be?
{19860}{19944}The one with "Heston" on it.
{19950}{20032}Interesting.
{20304}{20391}I got some ones.|You want to put them in her panties?
{20397}{20487}No, thanks, Mom!
{20539}{20570}That.
{20576}{20640}You have to put that out|because I'm pregnant.
{20646}{20751}Maybe you and your baby|ought to go to another strip club.
{20757}{20846}It's not my baby.
{20872}{20954}Very good.
{20955}{21070}Really good. I enjoyed it.|Very exotic.
{21076}{21153}I just checked our messages|and Joshua didn't call.
{21159}{21241}You'd think he'd be worried|about me not showing up.
{21247}{21290}You know what makes it worse?
{21296}{21356}Ross is all happy in Vermont.
{21362}{21462}Come on, look where you are!
{21486}{21511}Another round.
{21517}{21556}Virgin for me.
{21562}{21640}Don't let me leave without|the name of that carpet guy.
{21646}{21699}Come on!
{21705}{21776}You know what?|I'll go home and call Kathy.
{21782}{21815}If it'll help.
{21821}{21889}That was a test.|In a few hours, I'll be drunk.
{21895}{21953}I'll want to call her.|You'll have to stop me.
{21959}{22024}Then I'll be so drunk,|I'll want to call Janice.
{22030}{22107}You should! How is she?
{22116}{22232}I think somebody needs|another lap dance.
{22619}{22697}Who's in there?
{22790}{22838}How you doing?
{22844}{22896}Who in the hell are you?
{22902}{23017}Would you believe me|if I said I was Kirk Douglas?
{23017}{23119}Put some pants on, kid,|so I can kick your butt.
{23125}{23200}No, wait. You don't understand.
{23206}{23269}I'm an actor.
{23275}{23346}Joey Tribbiani.|I'm doing a scene with you today.
{23352}{23401}And I stink!
{23407}{23452}You're in this picture?
{23458}{23545}I'm a cop who won't work with you|because you're a loose cannon.
{23551}{23591}Anyway, I'm really sorry.
{23597}{23655}But I stink.
{23670}{23747}Joey, right?
{23806}{23914}Every actor, one time or another...
{23952}{23994}Every actor thinks he stinks.
{24000}{24083}Even Laurence Olivier|sometimes thought he stank.
{24089}{24147}Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
{24153}{24176}You don't understand.
{24182}{24257}Listen to me.
{24260}{24324}I don't know one actor|worth his salt...
{24330}{24421}...who, one time in his career,|didn't say, "God, I stink!"
{24427}{24571}I just did a scene out there.|First take, I stunk the place up.
{24602}{24669}The important thing,|and you must remember...
{24675}{24745}...no matter how badly|you think you stink...
{24751}{24889}...you must never, ever bust into|my dressing room and use my shower!
{24895}{24933}Do you understand me?
{24939}{25013}- Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.|- Wait a minute!
{25019}{25102}Take your pants.
{25154}{25208}We did okay|at the strip club, right?
{25214}{25300}Great. Thanks to you,|the hottest waitress is quitting...
{25306}{25371}...to teach the third grade!
{25377}{25420}He still hasn't called.
{25426}{25449}Who, Josh?
{25455}{25479}It's Joshua.
{25485}{25579}- He doesn't like "Josh"?|- No, I don't.
{25580}{25638}I'm going to put my sweats back on.
{25644}{25682}You know what?|You were right.
{25688}{25758}We weren't great at being guys.|You know why?
{25764}{25852}Because we're girls.
{25852}{25892}You know what girls are good at?
{25898}{25965}Stripping!
{25982}{26011}No, listening!
{26017}{26051}Sit.
{26057}{26171}Maybe it would really, really help|if you would just talk.
{26177}{26284}Yeah, come on.|What's going on in there?
{26316}{26419}And you know, if you want to cry,|that's okay too.
{26425}{26527}I'm going to have|to ask you all to leave.
{26531}{26634}Forget it. We tried,|but phase three is a lost cause.
{26640}{26787}Those strippers were hot, and I|couldn't picture myself with them.
{26845}{26896}They really were pretty,|weren't they?
{26902}{26960}- I liked that fighter pilot one.|- Candy?
{26966}{27056}She was so spunky!
{27058}{27162}I think if I were going|to be with a woman...
{27190}{27249}...it'd be with someone|like Michelle.
{27255}{27311}She was just so petite.
{27317}{27410}For me, it would have to be Chantal.
{27477}{27520}She had the smoothest skin.
{27526}{27616}When I stuck that dollar in|her G-string and grazed her thigh...
{27622}{27745}Phase three!|I just achieved phase three!
{27751}{27844}I am totally picturing you|with all those women!
{27850}{27883}That's not phase three.
{27889}{27971}Well, I'm there too!
{27977}{28018}Are we all together in a group?
{28024}{28076}Stop it, you're killing me!
{28082}{28126}I think I moved on to phase four!
{28132}{28172}What is that?
{28178}{28224}I don't want a relationship ever!
{28230}{28342}I just want sex|with strippers and my friends!
{28376}{28406}Come on.
{28412}{28460}Let me see that smile.
{28466}{28509}I don't want to.
{28515}{28551}Please?
{28557}{28626}I wanted to go to the strip club!
{28632}{28673}You'll have plenty of chances.
{28679}{28799}There are thousands of women out there,|just waiting to screw me over.
{28805}{28882}Yeah, all right.
{28917}{28955}How was Vermont?
{28961}{29014}Emily is...
{29020}{29108}...incredible. There are|no words to describe her.
{29114}{29230}The whole weekend was like a dream.
{29230}{29299}And you! Rach!
{29305}{29340}You were so right.
{29346}{29369}What?
{29375}{29453}What you said about us|finally being in a place...
{29459}{29549}...where we could really|be happy for each other.
{29555}{29634}I admit, I wasn't quite there.
{29640}{29711}The thought of you|and that Josh guy...
{29717}{29765}Joshua.
{29771}{29863}- Joshua guy at that club,|dancing, having a good time.
{29869}{29932}And the thought of it kind of...
{29938}{29985}You know? But now!
{29991}{30058}But now, I'm totally there.
{30064}{30115}I'm finally where you are.
{30121}{30198}Thank goodness!
{30199}{30249}And thank you for Emily.
{30255}{30335}No problem.|I'm so glad I could help, you know?
{30341}{30380}I'm happy for you.
{30386}{30433}Happy for you.
{30439}{30522}Oh no, happy for you.
{30606}{30660}All right. Here's what we'll do.
{30666}{30726}You are going to take off|my clothes.
{30732}{30779}You two, go get the oils.
{30785}{30836}And you, just constantly scream...
{30842}{30911}..."Chandler's the king!|Chandler's the king!"
{30917}{30965}I want to be with her.|I like her.
{30971}{31041}That's fine.|Go with your instincts!
{31047}{31079}What am I doing again?
{31085}{31150}Pay attention.|I could wake up at any moment.
{31156}{31216}I'm Joshua.|I'm here to pick up Rachel.
{31222}{31281}That's not Joshua.
{31287}{31361}What do you want from me?|I never met the guy.
{31367}{31410}I'm sorry you can't stay.
{31416}{31532}The rest of us|have a lot of work to do.
{31582}{31638}What are you doing?
{31644}{31732}All right, listen.|I got to wake up.
{68}{116}I'm getting my nails done!
{122}{188}You said it was going to be fun.
{194}{265}Which it kind of is.
{271}{344}You said there would be guys.|There are no guys.
{350}{397}There's one right over there.
{403}{454}That's a mailman!
{460}{547}That's our mailman!
{670}{769}Don't worry. This doesn't|make you any less of a guy.
{775}{850}That does.
{857}{941}What am I sitting on?
{954}{1047}What was this woman scratching|when this broke off?
{1053}{1099}You know who had nails like that?
{1105}{1129}Oh...
{1135}{1161}...my...
{1167}{1240}...God!
{1272}{1351}The One with All the Rugby
{2464}{2508}Joey, let me ask you a question.
{2514}{2571}What does this light switch do?
{2577}{2609}Nothing.
{2615}{2670}Did it drive you crazy|to not know?
{2676}{2762}I know what it did.|Nothing.
{2767}{2856}They put it there for something.|How can you not care?
{2862}{2932}Like this.
{2973}{3009}Here's another question.
{3015}{3086}What does the silver|knob on the toilet do?
{3092}{3122}It flushes it.
{3128}{3263}Since you know, when you come over,|would you use it?
{3437}{3510}Guess who we saw today?
{3533}{3585}- Janice!|- Is this amazing?
{3591}{3705}- How have you been?|- Well, I'm divorced.
{3723}{3825}I'm riding the alimony pony.
{3840}{3920}And there it is.
{3925}{4015}I just came up to say "hi".
{4015}{4058}Sweetie, I'll see you later.
{4064}{4140}I'll see you tonight.
{4208}{4283}I can't stand the woman!
{4297}{4362}What?|I thought you were crazy about her!
{4368}{4455}But you know all those annoying|things she did before?
{4461}{4528}Her voice, her laugh|and her personality?
{4534}{4597}They're all back!
{4602}{4666}And she's picked up, like,|nine new ones!
{4672}{4779}Why'd you bring her here?|There's people here!
{4794}{4849}Don't worry.|I'm taking care of it.
{4855}{4928}You are not!|You never break up with her.
{4934}{4971}I don't have to break up.
{4977}{5044}We're not involved.|I'll do a preemptive strike.
{5050}{5119}I'll end it with her|before it starts.
{5125}{5215}My ass is, like, frozen!
{5222}{5335}Try sticking it in the freezer|for 20 minutes.
{5381}{5441}I'm telling you!
{5580}{5654}I can't believe|you walk alone here at night.
{5660}{5754}- You hear such stories about New York.|- It's not that bad.
{5760}{5866}I mean, I, for one,|feel perfectly safe.
{5870}{5933}Help! Help!
{5958}{5986}No, no, Ross!
{5992}{6038}These are friends from home.
{6044}{6113}Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
{6119}{6178}- Hi, mate.|- How are you, man?
{6184}{6278}That was a good one, huh?|"Help! Help!"
{6284}{6306}How are you?
{6312}{6390}I've been meaning to ring you|ever since I arrived...
{6396}{6436}...but I've been rather busy.
{6442}{6528}We have not seen each other|since that U2 concert.
{6534}{6578}Oh, my God. You're right.
{6584}{6687}Actually, the last time we saw|each other was the next morning.
{6693}{6744}Oh, Liam!
{6750}{6825}Oh, Liam.
{6829}{6883}So were you guys playing soccer?
{6889}{6982}Or should I call it "football"?
{6988}{7029}We were playing rugby.
{7035}{7114}In fact, we're playing tomorrow.|You're welcome to play.
{7120}{7225}Ross play rugby?|I don't think so.
{7253}{7292}What's so funny?
{7298}{7424}Well, you're American, to start with.|You don't have rugby here.
{7430}{7543}Well, we didn't have freedom|here until 1776 either, so...
{7549}{7614}So, good!|We'll see you at the park at two.
{7620}{7690}Cheers!
{7864}{7962}Oh, boy! I just love to sing.
{7968}{8002}Yes, I know you do.
{8008}{8048}The reason people complained...
{8054}{8170}...was because they paid to hear|the actor sing "Old Man River".
{8176}{8199}Look at us!
{8205}{8343}Who would've thought Cupid had|a station at 14th Street Nails?
{8349}{8430}Okay, we have to talk.
{8431}{8524}I'm just getting out of|a very serious relationship.
{8530}{8603}I know. And I'm just|getting out of a marriage.
{8609}{8697}Talk about "meant to be".
{8703}{8782}Right. But I think this|is happening too soon.
{8788}{8862}Oh, too soon, too schmoon!
{8868}{8963}Face it, I'm not letting you|get away this time.
{8969}{9044}I hear you!
{9088}{9108}But...
{9114}{9144}...unfortunately...
{9150}{9187}...my company...
{9193}{9286}...is transferring me overseas.
{9295}{9347}Oh, no!
{9353}{9401}Where to?
{9407}{9444}To Paris?
{9450}{9486}No, not Paris.
{9492}{9558}To London? Rome? Vienna?
{9564}{9584}Barcelona?
{9590}{9691}Could you just stop talking|for a second?
{9712}{9790}Yemen.
{9803}{9894}That's right. Yes!|I'm being transferred to Yemen!
{9900}{9924}When?
{9930}{9992}I don't know exactly.
{9998}{10099}Well, I will just have to|soak up every ounce...
{10105}{10241}...of Chandler Bing until|that moment comes.
{10247}{10345}But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.
{10419}{10493}- Done?|- Yep!
{10505}{10531}What's up?
{10537}{10579}This switch is|driving me crazy.
{10585}{10645}I turned it off|and checked every outlet.
{10651}{10746}Four don't work, which means|one is controlled by the switch.
{10752}{10837}So I plugged things in the outlets|that make noise.
{10843}{10967}That way, when I turn it on,|I just follow the noise.
{10974}{11044}Bet I stopped listening first.
{11050}{11128}You know, you also could|have used lamps...
{11134}{11183}...and followed the light.
{11189}{11285}Yeah, well, I'm using noise.
{11291}{11339}So, everybody ready?
{11345}{11402}Here we go!
{11454}{11562}Something. I hear something.|Where is it?
{11802}{11875}It's coming from Joey!
{11880}{11992}Oh, my God! That's so freaky!|Turn him off!
{12173}{12261}Could we put on the news?|It might be raining.
{12267}{12358}Hold on. I'm watching|this rugby thing on ESPN.
{12364}{12432}I'm man enough to play this sport!
{12438}{12566}You're not even man enough to|get the channel that carries the sport.
{12572}{12639}Hey there, Ross!
{12680}{12750}Janice.
{12772}{12859}You know, you really didn't|have to help me pack.
{12865}{12963}When you said all you'd be doing|before you leave is packing...
{12969}{13026}...you really didn't|leave me much choice.
{13032}{13131}I thought I did,|but I guess I did not.
{13153}{13182}What's going on?
{13188}{13309}I'm packing, you know,|because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
{13315}{13390}Thanks for telling me!
{13420}{13536}I'm going to be pretend-moving|to Yemen. To get rid of her.
{13542}{13603}Good one!
{13606}{13699}Yemen! That actually sounds|like a real country!
{13705}{13812}I'll show you how to roll your|underwear and stuff it in your shoes.
{13818}{13849}It's a space-saver.
{13855}{13959}I do that because|it makes me look taller.
{13997}{14063}Come on!
{14063}{14160}- Joey, trade lives with me.|- Nope.
{14172}{14234}Ross, I can't believe|you said you'd play.
{14240}{14266}This is brutal!
{14272}{14308}I can handle it.
{14314}{14441}Please, Ross. You got hurt|playing badminton with my dad.
{14447}{14567}That's because your mom's dog|kept looking at me.
{14585}{14646}Look! Right here,|it's called a "scrum".
{14652}{14686}It's like a huddle.
{14692}{14779}And is a hum like a scruddle?
{14785}{14881}Ross, they're going kill you!
{14892}{14953}Why are you doing this, anyway?
{14959}{15023}You should've seen the guy|she used to date.
{15029}{15079}He's like "Joe Rugby"!
{15085}{15198}You're kidding! And he plays rugby?|That's funny!
{15210}{15298}Oh, I see. You did that.
{15303}{15404}She thought the very idea of me|playing rugby was hilarious.
{15410}{15507}So I'll show her|how tough I really am.
{15554}{15609}I'm sorry.|You are a tough guy.
{15615}{15699}The toughest paleontologist I know.
{15705}{15794}Ross can take care of himself.|It's not like he's Chandler.
{15800}{15852}Thanks.
{15858}{15889}Don't worry about me.
{15895}{15977}I'll just look energetic|and stay away from the ball.
{15983}{16090}I'll be that guy,|right outside the circle.
{16196}{16295}Maybe there was a dog|looking at him.
{16504}{16555}Stay away from that guy|and that guy...
{16561}{16666}...and that one.|Dude, they're all huge!
{16668}{16706}They're no bigger than me.
{16712}{16854}You're closer to you. So you look|bigger to you from where you are.
{16860}{16942}I'm going to go say "hello".
{17118}{17191}I kind of liked it.
{17211}{17251}I know what to do.
{17257}{17326}I've got to go Red Ross.
{17332}{17394}You know, Red Ross?
{17400}{17440}Totally don't know.
{17446}{17524}That time we were in line|for "Dances With Wolves"...
{17530}{17617}...and that guy cut in front of us|and I just lost it?
{17623}{17688}Screamed at him, turned all red!
{17694}{17766}Red Ross!
{17810}{17869}You'll see!
{17875}{17916}Liam, do me a favor.
{17922}{18012}Go easy on Ross.|It's his first time.
{18018}{18082}You don't say?
{18274}{18332}Good luck, babe.
{18338}{18413}Come on, get in here!
{18424}{18481}Come on!
{18648}{18694}Come on, get in the bloody scrum!
{18700}{18771}Ross, get in!
{19018}{19082}Joey!
{19138}{19228}You're not going to believe it!|Joshua came in today, and guess what?
{19234}{19264}He asked you out?
{19270}{19402}But I showed him some cuff links,|and I felt his pulse.
{19413}{19478}Saucy!
{19484}{19598}- What are these?|- Electrical plans for the building.
{19604}{19664}Okay, should I be scared?
{19670}{19762}I know that switch does something.|I got these from City Hall.
{19768}{19859}I just paid $25|and waited for three hours.
{19865}{19958}Wow! If only more people knew!
{20220}{20300}You really didn't have to|take me to the airport.
{20306}{20378}Oh, please.|Every moment is precious.
{20384}{20453}Besides, someone had to ride|with your luggage.
{20459}{20551}And your friends don't seem to care|that you're leaving.
{20557}{20634}We're not that close.
{20654}{20721}Okay. So I guess this is goodbye then.
{20727}{20759}Oh, no!
{20765}{20861}It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving|till you get on that plane.
{20867}{20986}Okay. Well, I guess|it's just "wait here" then.
{21025}{21102}I need a fake ticket to Yemen.
{21108}{21170}One ticket?
{21170}{21230}I just need a pretend ticket.
{21236}{21282}I'm sorry.|I don't understand.
{21288}{21359}Okay, what would you give a kid|to play with?
{21365}{21455}Are you traveling with a child?
{21537}{21596}She'll think I'm|handing you a credit card.
{21602}{21721}But what I'll really hand you|is a library card.
{21727}{21849}A ticket to Yemen is $2100,|and we don't take library cards.
{21855}{21921}What's the matter?|Is something wrong?
{21927}{22001}Do you have to stay?
{22005}{22085}American Express?
{22289}{22383}I can't believe they're doing that!|I told them to go easy on him!
{22389}{22537}No offense, but sometimes it's hard|to understand you, with the accent.
{22543}{22634}That's just halftime.|There's more.
{22665}{22689}Did you see me?
{22695}{22791}I was pretty good.|That is one fun game!
{22797}{22849}Do me a favor?|Grab me some water?
{22855}{22917}Thanks!
{22938}{22982}I think I'm dying.|I really do.
{22988}{23013}Poor baby!
{23019}{23098}Tell my son that I love him.
{23099}{23176}Excellent!|Got to have some more fun!
{23182}{23258}They are killing you.
{23261}{23288}That's not true.
{23294}{23336}She's right.|You have to stop!
{23342}{23414}No! I'm not stopping.|I'm Red Ross!
{23420}{23497}Dude, you go back out there,|you'll be Dead Ross.
{23503}{23578}I'm not quitting.|I'm going to finish this game.
{23584}{23654}If you insist on it,|at least let me help you.
{23660}{23777}It's no place for a woman.|Those guys will grab anything!
{23783}{23896}That's not it. I just know a few things|that can help you inflict pain.
{23902}{23945}I like that.
{23951}{23979}Listen closely.
{23985}{24034}Devon has got a weak ankle.
{24040}{24088}One swift kick and he'll back off.
{24094}{24133}Bad ankle. Got it!
{24139}{24244}And that big bloke with the beard?|He's got a trick hip.
{24250}{24333}And David over there,|he doesn't wear a cup.
{24339}{24409}I could use that.|Trick hip, no cup. Okay!
{24415}{24529}And Liam's got bad knees. Hit him right|and he'll go down like a lamp.
{24535}{24576}But Liam's on my team.
{24582}{24667}- I don't care. Just get him!|- Go and get him!
{24673}{24757}I am going back in!
{24793}{24891}Red Ross! Yeah!
{25092}{25117}What are these?
{25123}{25201}Just some pictures|I made and hung up.
{25207}{25320}I thought they'd brighten up the place.|Don't they?
{25495}{25612}There's no hole there.|I just really like that picture.
{25639}{25695}Oh, my God! Look at this!
{25701}{25782}But there is a wire there!|It's connected to something!
{25788}{25884}I don't care! The wires have|come loose in your head!
{25890}{25964}If I could follow the wire,|I'd find out what it did.
{25970}{25992}And did you?
{25998}{26042}No.
{26048}{26104}It disappears behind there.
{26110}{26216}For a minute, I thought|it went downstairs.
{26289}{26349}But it didn't.
{26363}{26402}Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.
{26408}{26439}Oh, my God!
{26445}{26561}- Hello, darling.|- Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.
{26649}{26700}Are you sure you|don't want a doctor?
{26706}{26779}No, that'll just bring me down!
{26785}{26883}This was great! I was great!|This was a great day!
{26889}{26944}I'm buying everyone coffee.
{26950}{27012}Just grab my wallet.|It's in my pocket.
{27018}{27079}No, not you.
{27085}{27172}Your eye's still popping out.|I'll go get some ice.
{27178}{27278}Ice, yeah!|I'm so in the mood for ice.
{27288}{27346}You were amazing out there.
{27352}{27389}I kind of was, wasn't I?
{27395}{27417}Oh, my God!
{27423}{27519}I made a man twice my size cry!
{27525}{27678}I haven't done that since I was four and|I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
{27678}{27736}You really enjoyed yourself,|didn't you?
{27742}{27801}Are you kidding?|I hurt three huge men.
{27807}{27852}I gave a guy a bloody nose!
{27858}{27928}I'm not proud of it...
{27934}{27997}...but I really am!
{28003}{28051}And it's all because of you.
{28057}{28168}- Wonderful, amazing you.|- I think you've got a concussion.
{28174}{28259}No, I'm serious.|Thank you.
{28265}{28348}You're welcome.
{28364}{28407}I'm sorry.|Did that hurt you?
{28413}{28477}It's worth the pain.
{28478}{28570}You know what? It's not.
{28662}{28795}{y:i}This is the final boarding call|{y:i}for flight 664 to Yemen.
{28835}{28894}Well, I guess I gotta go.
{28900}{28977}My Bing-a-ling.
{28999}{29030}I'll wait for you.
{29036}{29102}How long will you be gone?
{29108}{29262}Well, just until we find|an energy source to replace fuel.
{29295}{29342}I'll write you every day.
{29348}{29459}15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
{29462}{29547}Okay. Goodbye.
{29955}{30037}Janice! There you are!|I had to have one last kiss.
{30043}{30139}And also, you said you'd leave|after I got on the plane!
{30145}{30244}No. I want to see you take off.
{30250}{30345}Well, then I guess|I'm going to Yemen.
{30353}{30427}I'm going to Yemen!
{30433}{30550}When we get to Yemen,|can I stay with you?
{30679}{30756}All right. The super couldn't|figure out what it did.
{30762}{30854}The $200-an-hour electrician|couldn't figure out what it did.
{30860}{30951}I've had seven|pretty serious shocks.
{30957}{30981}I give up.
{30987}{31048}Thank God.
{31054}{31111}I guess Joey was right.
{31117}{31195}It does nothing.
{31279}{31350}See?
{31414}{31528}I'm doing it!|I am totally doing it!
{31664}{31734}I lost it.
{114}{133}What is it?
{139}{234}I can't find anything to eat.|Everything makes me nauseous.
{240}{344}Being pregnant is no piece of cake.|Oh, cake!
{403}{471}Honey, I'm sorry.
{477}{578}What is that smell?|It's coming from the bathroom.
{584}{675}Pregnancy does give you|some weird cravings.
{681}{815}It's me. Listen, there's|something in here I want to eat.
{821}{885}What smells so good?
{891}{991}Is it the shampoo?|It's guava.
{996}{1053}Wait.
{1059}{1146}Is it my bologna sandwich?
{1211}{1314}I can't believe it! The baby|wants bologna. I can't eat meat.
{1320}{1375}Wait!
{1381}{1437}Maybe it's the pickle!
{1443}{1518}The One with the Fake Party
{2676}{2702}What are you writing?
{2708}{2809}Joshua's coming in, and since|I don't have the guts to ask him out...
{2815}{2916}...I'll sell him a coat|and put this note in the pocket.
{2922}{3020}"Joshua, give me a call sometime.|Guys like you...
{3026}{3100}...never go out of style."
{3106}{3191}What did you throw away?
{3208}{3277}- Hi, guys.|- What have you been up to?
{3283}{3383}We went to see a collection of|Victorian doorknobs at the museum.
{3389}{3459}Without me?
{3463}{3550}My uncle dragged us there,|but it turned out to be interesting.
{3556}{3626}They were so ornate and beautiful.|Look at that.
{3632}{3755}I don't know about England, but here,|you're not supposed to take stuff.
{3761}{3804}I got it from the gift shop.
{3810}{3893}They have really lax security.
{3896}{3968}It's a joke.
{4055}{4151}I've got to be off.|See you.
{4194}{4234}You're having a good time.
{4240}{4339}She is amazing,|and she's so much fun.
{4345}{4471}And you know what?|When I'm with her, I'm fun!
{4475}{4564}I even signed up|for helicopter classes.
{4570}{4645}She's leaving in two days.|I don't have to do it.
{4651}{4699}In two days?|You must be bummed.
{4705}{4804}She's got to go back,|but I've been prepared for this.
{4810}{4899}We knew we had two weeks together|and then that's it.
{4905}{4980}That's what all|my relationships are like.
{4986}{5102}But in Ross' case,|they both know two weeks is it.
{5181}{5266}Yeah, I know. I know!
{5275}{5331}The baby is totally craving meat.
{5337}{5449}I made it a soy burger, so that|it'd think it was getting meat.
{5455}{5501}And I got nauseous.
{5507}{5604}Maybe that's because soy burgers suck!
{5610}{5659}Pregnancy is hard on your tummy.
{5665}{5732}But you got that|cool pregnant-lady glow.
{5738}{5853}You throw up all morning,|you'll have that glow too.
{6046}{6161}- Here's that trench coat you wanted.|- Great.
{6171}{6209}It's comfortable.
{6215}{6297}You could really|flash somebody in this.
{6303}{6437}Don't put your hands in the pockets|until you are out of the store.
{6443}{6467}Why not?
{6473}{6514}Well, because...
{6520}{6611}...we get a lot of...
{6631}{6670}They ruin it for everybody.
{6676}{6705}I know.
{6711}{6808}I wore that sweater|on a date last night.
{6809}{6883}It was the first date|since the divorce.
{6889}{6980}Congratulations.|So do you love her?
{6986}{7053}She's nice,|but it made me realize...
{7059}{7165}...I'm just not ready to be dating.
{7251}{7337}That's interesting.
{7343}{7429}- What was that?|- Just an anti-theft device.
{7435}{7470}Then what's this?
{7476}{7611}You need that too, because|a thief could just tear this up.
{7705}{7840}We have to have a party in five minutes,|so everybody cancel your plans.
{7846}{7876}What's going on?
{7882}{7953}We have to have|a bon voyage party for Emily.
{7959}{8031}But it's actually for Joshua.
{8037}{8094}He said he's not ready to date.
{8100}{8168}So I had to invite him to a party.
{8174}{8303}And now I have created|the perfect opportunity to seduce him.
{8309}{8428}As much as I'd like|to meet Josh and warn him...
{8437}{8533}...Emily and I won't be here.|She'll come by to say goodbye.
{8539}{8674}I've got a special evening planned.|Sorry. No party.
{8730}{8799}Surprise!
{8805}{8886}Surprise!
{8889}{8951}No one's thrown me|a surprise party before.
{8957}{9061}Well, it was all Ross' idea.
{9063}{9120}You're so sweet.
{9126}{9210}And I'm so surprised.
{9276}{9345}You didn't know?
{9556}{9625}Why are you here|if Joshua's over there?
{9631}{9717}I'm trying to play hard-to-get.
{9723}{9788}Quick! Say something funny.
{9794}{9861}Like what?
{9883}{9958}What's so funny?
{9968}{10032}"Like what?"
{10042}{10107}Now that's a thinker.
{10113}{10180}This playing-hard-to-get thing|is not working.
{10186}{10276}Hand me those cherries.
{10436}{10491}- Care for a cherry?|- No, thanks.
{10497}{10631}I can tie one of these into a knot|using just my tongue.
{10916}{10954}You okay?
{10960}{11017}All right?
{11113}{11168}We should probably get going soon.
{11174}{11234}But the party's just getting started.
{11240}{11335}We have to be at The Four Seasons|for drinks in 15 minutes.
{11341}{11384}Then The Plaza for dinner.
{11390}{11490}Why did you plan a party|at the same time?
{11569}{11667}Actually, American surprise parties|are very short.
{11673}{11816}It's usually, "Surprise!"|Then, "My God, I'm so surprised. Bye!"
{11830}{11883}But I'm having such a great time.
{11889}{11984}Your sister told me that|you dressed up like old ladies...
{11990}{12086}...and hosted make-believe|tea parties.
{12121}{12196}Monica said that, did she?
{12202}{12280}Then what are you going|to put on top of that?
{12286}{12361}A little salami.
{12400}{12460}What goes on top of the salami?
{12466}{12523}Pastrami.
{12581}{12666}You're a genius.
{12698}{12776}Give me a hand with the zipper.
{12804}{12871}Up!
{12904}{12989}- You changed?|- I just needed my lucky dress.
{12995}{13095}- Lucky means more cleavage?|- It does for me.
{13333}{13375}Look at him!|He's so cute.
{13381}{13450}I just want to grab him and kiss him.
{13456}{13520}How could I kiss him|without him knowing I like him?
{13526}{13636}I know how you can get him.|Take off your bra.
{13651}{13729}- This scene in "Footloose"...|{y:i}- Flashdance.
{13735}{13826}- With that plumber girl?|- A welder.
{13850}{13930}Were you, like, in the movie?
{13950}{14063}She takes off her bra under the shirt|and pulls it out the sleeve.
{14069}{14171}Very sexy. And classy.
{14223}{14315}- Or you could use mistletoe.|- It's not Christmas.
{14321}{14402}- Spin the bottle.|- He's not 11.
{14458}{14529}Thank you.|It was so thoughtful of you.
{14535}{14564}You're leaving?
{14570}{14659}- We have something we have to get to.|- I'll take off too.
{14665}{14732}You can't leave yet.|You have to stay.
{14738}{14810}We've got the whole|big thing planned.
{14816}{14842}What big thing?
{14848}{14935}Spin-The-Bottle works like this:|I spin.
{14941}{15045}Lands on Gunther,|so I'd kiss Gunther.
{15109}{15147}Who wants to go first?
{15153}{15219}I'll go.
{15309}{15383}Welcome to America.
{15519}{15578}Oh, my God!
{15584}{15686}Two in a row!|Use your tongues now.
{15785}{15856}All right.
{15864}{15943}What are the odds?
{15952}{16026}That's enough!
{16028}{16115}Let's let someone else play.
{16121}{16226}If you didn't want to play,|why'd you come?
{16237}{16311}Okay, my turn!
{16374}{16399}Look at that!
{16405}{16472}Oh, my God.
{16534}{16588}The baby just kicked!
{16594}{16706}If it kicked once, it'll kick again!
{16761}{16896}Everybody just remember|where they were sitting.
{17090}{17164}It was a bug.
{17190}{17232}It doesn't matter|how much I'm craving it.
{17238}{17358}I'll never eat meat.|It's cold-blooded murder.
{17504}{17596}There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
{17606}{17639}What are you doing?
{17645}{17697}I can't help it!
{17703}{17772}I need the meat!|The baby needs the meat.
{17778}{17933}When you date, you don't want to cheat|unless it's with someone really hot.
{17976}{17995}Totally.
{18001}{18076}This is the same kind of deal.
{18082}{18171}If you do something wrong...
{18189}{18248}...do it right.
{18374}{18408}Feel better?
{18414}{18482}Yeah, but at what cost?
{18488}{18536}Six months, three meals a day?
{18542}{18673}I am going to eat like,|you know, millions of cows.
{18697}{18788}What if I even things out|for you, meat-wise?
{18794}{18838}I eat a lot of meat, right?
{18844}{18928}But suppose, until the baby's born,|I laid off it.
{18934}{19054}No extra animals would die.|You'd be eating my animals.
{19056}{19100}I can't believe you'd do that for me.
{19106}{19197}Absolutely!|I could be a vegetarian.
{19203}{19272}There's no meat in beer, right?
{19278}{19415}We can still make dinner|if we skip the appetizers.
{19489}{19606}We can't go now.|Rachel is going to put on a skit.
{19619}{19695}Oh, my God!|Have you lost your mind?
{19701}{19804}I am finally thinking clearly.
{19809}{19858}My lucky dress wasn't working.
{19864}{19955}But for four years,|this baby never missed.
{19961}{20024}Wait, I can't let...
{20030}{20121}Actually, I want to see what happens.
{20177}{20258}Nice costume.
{20261}{20402}Well, I wanted to give Emily|a big American goodbye cheer.
{20498}{20550}Ready.
{20556}{20595}Give me an "E"!
{20601}{20639}Give me an "M"!
{20645}{20678}Give me an "I"!
{20684}{20712}Give me an "L"!
{20718}{20753}Give me a "Y"!
{20759}{20851}What do you get?
{21016}{21102}That's me as a cheerleader!
{21124}{21203}I loosened a tooth.|It's no big deal. I have a dentist.
{21209}{21306}I'll put some ice on it.|Excuse me.
{21326}{21358}What do I do now?
{21364}{21425}I think you're done.
{21435}{21520}Time to take off the bra.
{21570}{21649}That was really great.
{21655}{21701}But I got to take off.
{21707}{21816}Take the bra off.
{21863}{21939}Let's go get your coat.
{21985}{22061}Rachel's my girlfriend.
{22104}{22165}So this was really fun.
{22171}{22249}Yeah, it was real fun.
{22336}{22418}You know, this bra...
{22444}{22533}...is really bothering me.
{22539}{22615}This used to be my bedroom.
{22623}{22732}A lot of memories in here.|Lot of memories.
{22738}{22787}If these walls could talk,|they'd say:
{22793}{22881}"Want to hear some memories?"
{23001}{23034}Need a hand?
{23040}{23126}I got this all under control.
{23139}{23236}You really don't seem like you do.
{23313}{23410}God! Forget it!
{23478}{23550}This is not how|this was supposed to happen.
{23556}{23626}What was supposed to happen?
{23638}{23721}Can you not look at me?
{23786}{23890}I thought that|if I could get you here...
{23896}{23999}...I could seduce you.
{24098}{24178}I don't wear suits to work.
{24184}{24262}And I bought six of them from you.
{24268}{24375}I'm sorry.|I thought you needed them.
{24376}{24510}My point is, I kept coming back|because I wanted to see you.
{24514}{24570}Because I like you.
{24576}{24654}You like me?
{24658}{24772}I mean, you're beautiful|and smart and sophisticated.
{24778}{24865}A lot of this isn't based on tonight.
{24896}{24934}But you like me?
{24940}{25086}I can't believe this. All this time,|I liked you and you liked me!
{25101}{25130}No "but".
{25136}{25280}"But" is never good. Let's leave it|at "I like you and you like me."
{25306}{25406}- However...|- No, that's a fancy "but".
{25426}{25524}My marriage, like, just ended.
{25530}{25669}And I'm really not ready|to get into anything yet.
{25753}{25867}I'm sorry.|I just need a little time.
{26055}{26121}There you are.|I was looking for you.
{26127}{26203}Joshua's gone,|so you and Emily are free to go.
{26209}{26250}It's okay.
{26256}{26349}She's still in there|enjoying her fake party.
{26355}{26458}It's too late to do|the stuff I had planned.
{26481}{26573}I'm sorry.|I ruined your evening.
{26628}{26757}If it makes you feel any better,|I made a fool of myself.
{26766}{26824}Helps a little.
{26839}{26905}Is there room there|for a pathetic loser?
{26911}{26991}Have a seat.
{27113}{27165}I'm so sorry.
{27171}{27191}It's okay.
{27197}{27267}It was just a two-week thing anyway.
{27273}{27329}I just didn't want it|to end this way.
{27335}{27414}Or maybe you didn't want it to end?
{27420}{27459}What do you mean?
{27465}{27555}You seem to really like her.
{27579}{27656}I really do.
{27664}{27762}What am I going to do?|We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.
{27768}{27849}No commitment.
{27918}{28030}That girl just spent the entire evening|talking to your friends...
{28036}{28093}...asking to hear stories about you...
{28099}{28162}...Iooking through|Monica's photo albums.
{28168}{28253}You don't do that|if you're just in it for two weeks.
{28259}{28320}You think?
{28326}{28437}You've got 14 hours|until she has to be at the airport.
{28443}{28497}And you're sitting here|in a hallway...
{28503}{28616}...with a 28-year-old cheerleader|with a fat lip.
{28666}{28741}You're right.
{28980}{29040}What photo album was it?
{29046}{29147}It was you|and a bunch of albino kids.
{29190}{29249}Oh, my God!|Those weren't albino kids.
{29255}{29341}That was computer camp!
{29447}{29546}You're a pathetic loser, right?
{29551}{29618}Sit!
{29769}{29861}Oh, my God. Joshua.
{29889}{29957}All those things I said|about not being ready...
{29963}{30060}- They're not true?|- They're all true.
{30091}{30152}But...
{30200}{30270}I love that "but".
{30485}{30593}Do you want to go inside|and get some coffee?
{30761}{30851}Every time.
{30940}{31041}- What do you got there?|- Pastrami.
{31089}{31188}- You know what goes good with that?|- Corned beef.
{31196}{31290}I was going to say bologna.|But that's better.
{31296}{31381}How about that smoked turkey?
{31408}{31475}Oh, mama!
{31478}{31569}- When is the baby due?|- Six months.
{31575}{31683}If a cow died of natural causes,|I could have one of those, right?
{31689}{31776}Not if I get there first.
{170}{259}Oh, man!
{265}{359}- What's that?|- Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
{365}{473}What in the name of hell?
{480}{570}Maybe he found your flip-flop.
{645}{708}Is this porn?
{713}{769}I must have hit something|on the remote.
{775}{836}Do we pay for this?
{842}{897}We didn't even pay our cable bill.
{903}{967}Maybe this is how they punish us.
{973}{1052}Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.|Free phone sex.
{1058}{1173}Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.
{1185}{1284}Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
{1290}{1417}Joey pressed something on the remote|and it just came on.
{1424}{1517}It happened to me once.|It was like finding money.
{1523}{1602}Finding money|with naked people on it!
{1608}{1669}But I made the mistake|of turning off the TV.
{1675}{1731}I never got it back again.
{1737}{1799}And I'm sad.
{1890}{1966}Why would he turn off the TV?
{1972}{2049}The One with the Free Porn
{3198}{3335}Do we really have to watch this|while we eat?
{3335}{3434}We don't know|what could make this go away.
{3440}{3535}So no one touches the remote,|and no one touches the TV.
{3541}{3652}And no one touches the air|around the TV.
{3652}{3795}Imagine a protective porn bubble,|if you will.
{3795}{3885}I'm at least going to mute it.
{3952}{4016}We still have porn.
{4087}{4207}What are you doing?|That's too heavy. Give it here.
{4213}{4277}Oh, God.
{4332}{4443}I'm too pregnant for lugging|around a stupid massage table.
{4449}{4507}I need a job with a smaller table.
{4513}{4558}Or a job without a table.
{4564}{4634}You mean, like a doctor?
{4640}{4722}You're blocking the porn!
{4783}{4910}That reminds me.|I have to see my ob-gyn today.
{5045}{5102}Emily just went to the airport.
{5108}{5144}Why didn't you take her?
{5150}{5193}Her uncle had planned to do it.
{5199}{5282}We said our goodbyes this morning.
{5288}{5422}You must feel horrible.|Hey, the guys have free porn.
{5497}{5583}Hey, cheer up.|You'll see her again, right?
{5589}{5629}I don't know.
{5635}{5687}When I brought it up, she said...
{5693}{5773}..."This is so fantastic.|Why talk about the future?"
{5779}{5871}- "Let's enjoy..."|- Don't do the accent.
{5884}{5929}You've got to see her again.
{5935}{6009}- Why do you care?|- Because!
{6015}{6068}You could live out my fantasy.
{6074}{6152}You had fantasies about Emily?
{6158}{6230}You know, the fantasy.
{6236}{6354}Meet a foreigner, fall madly in love|and spend your lives together.
{6360}{6489}Is that why you hung out|with that Ukrainian kid in school?
{6498}{6645}Yeah, plus his mom used to put|sour cream on everything.
{6651}{6696}Do you love her?
{6702}{6794}We said it would|only be two weeks.
{6805}{6852}You love her.
{6858}{6926}What is love, really?
{6932}{6974}I knew you loved her!
{6980}{7033}You go to the airport and tell her.
{7039}{7107}You'll probably catch her at the gate.
{7113}{7181}You'll call her name|and yell "I love you!"
{7187}{7241}She'll say "I love you too!"
{7247}{7322}Then you will have|the most amazing kiss.
{7328}{7402}Everyone at the gate will applaud.
{7408}{7483}I am a good kisser.
{7489}{7602}Then you two can sneak|into the cockpit.
{7608}{7662}Things will start to heat up.
{7668}{7767}And then a stewardess comes in...
{7772}{7855}I've been watching too much porn.
{7939}{7984}- Is that the heartbeat?|- That's it.
{7990}{8040}Oh, my God!
{8046}{8104}This is so cool!
{8110}{8214}Have we talked about multiple births?
{8220}{8351}Let's take care of this one. If I|get pregnant again, I have your card.
{8357}{8466}No, I'm getting|three separate heartbeats.
{8472}{8562}You guys were worried|I wouldn't even have one.
{8568}{8665}Doctors are wrong all the time.
{8680}{8735}Are you sure that there are three?
{8741}{8838}- Definitely.|- Oh, my God.
{8926}{9085}So in a few months, I'll have three|babies walking around inside me?
{9087}{9233}It'll be like one of those log rides|when they come shooting out.
{9239}{9322}Giving birth to three|is like giving birth to one.
{9328}{9392}What do you know?
{9633}{9692}How'd it go at the doctor's?
{9698}{9784}You know how, when you're|walking down the street...
{9790}{9854}...and you see three people in a row.
{9860}{9971}And you say "Oh, that's nice."
{10074}{10171}Good news!|You'll have three babies.
{10177}{10257}Three babies?
{10285}{10359}I've finally got my band!
{10365}{10491}We'll have a big family!|I always wanted a big family.
{10497}{10621}I'm so glad you're happy!|I was afraid you'd be freaked.
{10627}{10661}Why would we be freaked?
{10667}{10808}Because it's harder to raise them|and the added expense.
{10865}{10903}Right.
{10909}{11017}No, back to happy.|Back to happy!
{11042}{11117}It's going to be fine...
{11123}{11177}...because I teach home ec.
{11183}{11279}I can have 30 kids making|baby clothes all year long.
{11285}{11435}It'll be like my very own|little sweatshop.
{11455}{11579}I was thinking, ever since|you said we'd have triplets.
{11609}{11706}The best thing for me to do is|drop out of college and get a job.
{11712}{11774}No, you can't quit college.
{11780}{11848}You're in college?
{11848}{11921}Refrigerator college.
{11930}{11997}When we found out|we were having a baby...
{12003}{12108}...I figured I should have|a career, you know?
{12114}{12179}And I love refrigerators.
{12185}{12246}You can't give up on your dream!
{12252}{12343}No, it's okay.|We're going to have three kids.
{12349}{12423}And that's a different kind of dream.
{12429}{12509}Three kids and no money.
{12620}{12740}{y:i}This is the boarding call|{y:i}for flight 009.
{12759}{12824}What are you doing here?
{12830}{12919}I had to see you|before you took off.
{12925}{13012}You are so sweet.
{13048}{13127}That's a big candy bar.
{13159}{13239}I had the most amazing time with you.
{13245}{13284}Me too.
{13290}{13407}{y:i}This is the final boarding call|{y:i}for flight 009.
{13413}{13485}Well, that's me.
{13655}{13678}Here, have this.
{13684}{13790}I'm only allowed|one piece of carry-on.
{13875}{13972}Listen, I have to tell you something.
{13978}{14023}I've been thinking.
{14029}{14112}I'm just going to say it, okay?
{14118}{14169}I think...
{14175}{14250}...I love you.
{14468}{14531}Thank you.
{14693}{14780}It's no problem.
{14940}{14991}What is that song?
{14997}{15111}It's the theme|from "Good Will Humping".
{15142}{15242}You know who doesn't like|dirty movies? My boyfriend Joshua.
{15248}{15315}Yeah, right.
{15321}{15418}He said he prefers to leave|certain things to the imagination.
{15424}{15507}Did he also say that|the dialogue was corny?
{15513}{15607}And that he found it funny, not sexy?
{15642}{15729}Yeah, he likes porn.
{15758}{15784}Where you going?
{15790}{15905}To find out if he really|thinks models are too skinny.
{15944}{15968}How'd it go?
{15974}{16024}Frank has to quit college...
{16030}{16113}...because his super-fertile|sister's having three babies.
{16119}{16236}I need to make money fast.|I wanted to talk to you about an idea.
{16242}{16286}You work for a big company.
{16292}{16356}Insider trading.
{16365}{16420}What information can you give me?
{16426}{16484}They don't talk to us|about that stuff.
{16490}{16577}But I can get you free White-Out.
{16627}{16694}- Did you do what I said?|- I did.
{16700}{16723}What'd she say?
{16729}{16800}"Thank you."
{16800}{16909}You're totally welcome.|What'd she say?
{16913}{16967}She said, "Thank you."
{16973}{17029}I said, "I love you."
{17035}{17144}And she said, "Thank you."
{17164}{17211}Did you say you love her?
{17217}{17320}What were you trying|to get her to do?
{17328}{17355}What do I do?
{17361}{17427}You play hard-to-get.
{17433}{17519}She already lives in London.
{17525}{17609}So you go to Tokyo.
{17615}{17647}Forget it.
{17653}{17720}You told her you love her.|It's over.
{17726}{17826}It is not over!|You're over!
{17832}{17904}What?
{17915}{17996}You know.
{18075}{18134}Good one.
{18140}{18232}It's not over. She'll call|and tell you she loves you.
{18238}{18314}Her feelings were so strong|that it scared her.
{18320}{18429}Go home and wait for her call.|She could call from the plane.
{18435}{18537}But if she doesn't call,|it is definitely over!
{18543}{18659}Unless, eventually, I call her|to see what's going on...
{18665}{18762}...and she says she'll call me back,|but then she doesn't.
{18768}{18850}Then it's over!
{18856}{18925}Way to be strong!
{19162}{19215}Can we watch cartoons on your TV?
{19221}{19276}We need a porn break.
{19282}{19414}We spent two hours watching|{y:i}In and Out and In Again.
{19420}{19469}Why don't you turn it off?
{19475}{19578}Then we'd be the guys|who turned off free porn.
{19584}{19657}Good, you're here!
{19663}{19693}What you got there?
{19699}{19805}This? I'm glad you asked.
{19843}{20000}Don't you hate to cut a tin can|with an ordinary steak knife?
{20048}{20092}I know what you're thinking.
{20098}{20178}Pregnant woman slays four?
{20197}{20261}Did they make you pay|for those knives?
{20267}{20324}You sure?
{20359}{20432}You won't make enough money|by selling knives.
{20438}{20536}I just need enough money|for the second part of my plan.
{20542}{20568}What's that?
{20574}{20655}My Saturn dealership.
{21017}{21064}How was your flight?
{21070}{21100}{y:i}It was dreadful.
{21106}{21214}It was terrible how I acted|when you said those wonderful things.
{21220}{21312}No, that's all right.
{21318}{21364}I'm just glad you called.
{21370}{21493}{y:i}Ross, there's something|{y:i}that I've got to tell you.
{21510}{21594}There's someone else.
{21665}{21802}Does that mean the same thing|in England as it does in America?
{21819}{21923}She doesn't know who she wants.|Me or this "Colin" guy.
{21929}{22070}This isn't how it's supposed to go.|There can't be another guy.
{22078}{22124}Of course, there's another guy!
{22130}{22214}This is even more perfect.
{22218}{22261}You have to prove your love!
{22267}{22359}I'm not proving anything.|I'm done listening to you.
{22365}{22418}If I hadn't let you talk me|into this...
{22424}{22488}...I wouldn't have put my fist|through the wall.
{22494}{22531}You did that?
{22537}{22623}I missed and hit the door.
{22629}{22708}But it opened really hard.
{22717}{22811}You have to go to London.|You have to go fight for her.
{22817}{22854}That makes sense.
{22860}{22934}You said you loved her,|and she didn't say it back.
{22940}{23084}Then she told you about another guy.|Go to London. Scare her!
{23119}{23181}When Rachel was with Paolo,|what did you do?
{23187}{23236}I made fun of his accent.
{23242}{23317}You sat back and let him have her.|You didn't fight.
{23323}{23406}You want that to happen with Emily?
{23412}{23472}Go fight for her!|Go to London.
{23478}{23565}That could be you and Emily.
{23610}{23668}That but nicer.
{23674}{23724}Go to London!
{23730}{23759}Really?
{23765}{23881}Surprise her.|Don't let her go without a fight.
{23887}{23963}All right. I'm going to do it.
{23969}{24051}I'm going to London,|and I'll fight for her.
{24057}{24133}Okay. Good luck!
{24153}{24290}Can you pick me up one|of those Toblerone bars at the airport?
{24419}{24523}I did it!|I figured out a way to make money.
{24529}{24600}I'll open a massage place.|Frank will help me.
{24606}{24745}We'll work it around his schedule,|so he doesn't have to quit school.
{24755}{24800}But how can you afford it?
{24806}{24889}We were walking down the street,|and we saw your van.
{24895}{24988}- And we realized...|- I'm telling it!
{24997}{25101}People need transportation,|and they need massages to relax.
{25107}{25217}We can combine the two.|I give massages and Frank drives.
{25223}{25313}I'll bolt a table in the van,|and you know what I've got?
{25319}{25414}A place that no one|will get out of alive?
{25420}{25543}Think about it. It's a taxi that|people take when they need to relax.
{25549}{25632}It's a Relaxi-Taxi!
{25638}{25711}The name was my favorite part!
{25717}{25751}I came up with it.
{25757}{25820}You did not!
{25866}{25991}You came up with Relaxi-Cab.|That's not good.
{26079}{26164}Oh, my god! Are you in England?|Was Emily surprised?
{26170}{26217}No, she hasn't come home yet.
{26223}{26334}She hasn't been home all night.|She must be with the other guy.
{26340}{26423}I'm the stupid moron|who spent the night here.
{26429}{26479}When is the next flight out?
{26485}{26509}About four hours.
{26515}{26606}{y:i}Stay there for a while.|{y:i}If she doesn't show up, come home.
{26612}{26659}Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.
{26665}{26758}Ask him if he likes it|better than Relaxi-Cab.
{26764}{26883}It's not Relaxi-Cab.|It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.
{26889}{26965}That is better.
{27125}{27179}Are we in London?
{27185}{27239}Why are you here?|You can't be here.
{27245}{27329}I've come to talk to Ross.
{27385}{27447}What?
{27485}{27531}Nothing.
{27537}{27567}I was going to call him...
{27573}{27644}You came to tell him you love him.|I knew it!
{27650}{27726}I was right!|I'm right, right?
{27732}{27802}I'd rather talk to him.
{27822}{27893}I've been to his apartment|and he's not there.
{27899}{28026}I need to talk to him.|Do you know where he is?
{28223}{28292}{y:i}Ross, are you there?
{28359}{28448}{y:i}I don't know if you hear this,|{y:i}but I'll talk anyway.
{28454}{28529}I'm in the States|with your sister and friends.
{28535}{28625}It's all over with Colin.
{28628}{28694}{y:i}I came here to tell you that|{y:i}and to tell you...
{28700}{28822}{y:i}Yes, Joey, you can have|{y:i}all the chocolate you want.
{28855}{28994}I came here to tell you|that I love you.
{29000}{29028}I love you too!
{29034}{29119}I'll call you right now|from the phone booth.
{29125}{29205}You can't hear me.
{29209}{29267}I wish I knew if you'd heard me.
{29273}{29354}I suppose I've given|my neighbors a good laugh.
{29360}{29500}Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,|bugger off. None of your business.
{29503}{29568}There's not much chance|you did hear that.
{29574}{29639}There's the call waiting...
{29645}{29732}...so I should go.
{29944}{30031}Ross, I love you.
{30084}{30160}Thank you.
{30390}{30463}There was this really hot teller|at the bank.
{30469}{30566}And she didn't ask me|to do it with her in the vault.
{30572}{30624}Same thing happened to me.
{30630}{30742}Pizza delivery girl comes over,|gives me the pizza and leaves!
{30748}{30826}No "Nice apartment,|bet the bedrooms are huge"?
{30832}{30899}Nothing!
{30905}{30983}You know what?|We have to turn off the porn.
{30989}{31075}I think you're right.
{31085}{31104}Ready?
{31110}{31202}One, two, three.
{31290}{31339}That's kind of nice.
{31345}{31425}That's kind of a relief.
{31563}{31648}You want to see|if we still have it?
{31655}{31752}- Free porn!|- We have free porn!
{165}{276}{y:i}Morning's here
{282}{337}{y:i}The morning's here
{343}{401}{y:i}Sunshine is here
{407}{441}{y:i}The sky is clear
{447}{501}{y:i}The morning's here
{507}{585}{y:i}The morning's here
{602}{695}Do you have to do that?|It's Saturday!
{701}{733}Oh, come on!
{739}{816}Morning's here!
{1064}{1153}I hate this apartment!
{1153}{1289}I hate this wall color!|I hate that it still smells like bird!
{1305}{1345}I hate that singing guy!
{1351}{1429}Are you kidding? I love that guy!
{1435}{1518}{y:i}Morning's here
{1524}{1590}Stop it!
{1593}{1659}I will kill you.
{1697}{1745}I hate that my room is so small.
{1751}{1815}I have all the space I need.|Do what I did.
{1821}{1950}You don't even have a bed.|You sleep in a ball on the floor!
{1959}{2014}I am tired of your bellyaching.
{2020}{2104}I've worked hard to make this|a nice place for us.
{2110}{2153}I know.|I'm so sorry.
{2159}{2202}I'm sorry, okay?
{2208}{2238}It's a great apartment!
{2244}{2326}Shut up!|This place is a hole!
{2351}{2429}The One with All the Haste
{3629}{3697}I still can't believe|you've got an earring!
{3703}{3815}I know, I know.|Who am I? David Bowie?
{3832}{3858}He does that?
{3864}{3919}I don't know. Whatever.
{3925}{3989}I think it makes you look|really dangerous.
{3995}{4058}Oh, I know.
{4064}{4091}You know what?
{4097}{4189}I never would've gotten this|if it weren't for you.
{4195}{4251}When I'm with you, I'm like...
{4257}{4324}...this whole other guy.|I love that guy!
{4330}{4379}I mean, I love you too.|A lot.
{4385}{4436}But that guy!
{4442}{4473}I love that guy!
{4479}{4559}I love both of you.
{4598}{4662}I wish I didn't have to go.
{4668}{4697}Then don't.
{4703}{4766}Stay here.|Don't go so soon to London.
{4772}{4808}Just one more day.
{4814}{4873}Please don't do this to me again.
{4879}{4977}I'd stay, but I've already missed|so much work. They'll fire me.
{4983}{5073}So? Then you could stay|as long as you want.
{5079}{5126}I wish I could.
{5132}{5218}Oh, no. Don't start packing.
{5224}{5286}Come on!
{5329}{5410}I don't think you understand packing.
{5416}{5538}I don't want to leave it till last.|Last time, I left my knickers here.
{5544}{5623}Yeah, I know.|I tried them on.
{5629}{5661}You didn't!
{5667}{5763}No, I didn't.|I didn't want to be "that guy".
{6088}{6107}Excuse me?
{6113}{6151}Your pants.
{6157}{6207}Oh yeah! You like them?
{6213}{6294}I went to a used-clothes store|and got maternity stuff.
{6300}{6395}These are so comfortable.
{6436}{6551}Pheebs, those are Santa pants.
{6558}{6609}Santa pants.
{6615}{6688}Santa Claus' pants.
{6694}{6750}No. They're maternity pants.
{6756}{6838}They even came with|a list of baby names. See?
{6844}{6945}These names are good,|and these are bad.
{7113}{7197}So, how are the elves?
{7199}{7317}I don't know.|How are the... you know?
{7336}{7420}Your clothes aren't funny.
{7423}{7493}What should I wear to a Knicks game?
{7499}{7597}A T-shirt that says,|"I Don't Belong Here"?
{7614}{7639}You have tickets?
{7645}{7745}Mom got Dad's season tickets in|the divorce, so she gave them to me.
{7751}{7803}Apparently, they're good seats.
{7809}{7865}Oh, my God!|Those are almost on the floor!
{7871}{7921}Do you guys want these?
{7927}{7982}Yeah, we do!
{7988}{8036}Well, you got them!
{8042}{8135}Just give us our apartment back.
{8173}{8257}Oh, I didn't see that coming.
{8266}{8289}Are you serious?
{8295}{8384}Come on.|We know what these are worth.
{8390}{8441}Do you think we're stupid?
{8447}{8538}Not stupid.|You're meaner than I thought.
{8544}{8566}What do you say?
{8572}{8682}Forget it. I'm not giving up my|bachelor pad for basketball seats.
{8688}{8743}Your "bachelor pad"?
{8749}{8834}Have you even had a girl here?
{8858}{8915}No.
{8915}{9036}But Joey has, and I usually|talk to them in the morning.
{9060}{9131}Yeah, you do!
{9239}{9275}Come on!
{9281}{9362}Gunther, can I get|two cups of chino, please?
{9368}{9422}Good one.
{9428}{9465}Come on.|Season tickets!
{9471}{9522}Season tickets!|You know what that means?
{9528}{9587}I'm not giving up the apartment.
{9593}{9694}When I was a kid, my dad's company|gave season tickets...
{9700}{9797}...to the No. 1 salesman|every year. My dad never won.
{9803}{9922}Of course, he wasn't in sales.|But still, I never forgot that!
{9928}{9996}Hey guys!
{10009}{10065}Oh, my God!
{10071}{10147}We don't make enough|fun of you already?
{10153}{10220}Oh, yeah.|Emily convinced me to do it.
{10226}{10331}You do know that Wham broke up?
{10378}{10482}I like it. Emily likes it.|That's what counts.
{10495}{10545}So, how are you guys doing?
{10551}{10653}Don't try and talk all normal|with that thing in your ear.
{10659}{10699}Where's Emily?
{10705}{10748}She's saying goodbye|to her uncle.
{10754}{10841}Didn't she, like, just get here?
{10847}{10884}Easy, tiger.
{10890}{10933}I just hate this so much.
{10939}{11032}Every time I go pick her up at|the airport, it's so great.
{11038}{11156}But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back|in a couple of days, dropping her off."
{11162}{11220}- So what'll you do?|- There's nothing to do.
{11226}{11269}She lives there.|I live here.
{11275}{11332}She'd have to move here.
{11338}{11394}She should move here.
{11400}{11425}What?
{11431}{11490}- I can ask her to live with me.|- Are you serious?
{11496}{11573}- I mean, why not?|- You've only known her six weeks!
{11579}{11697}I've got a carton of milk in my fridge|I've had a longer relationship with.
{11703}{11781}Look, guys, when I'm with her,|it's like...
{11787}{11868}She brings out this great side of me.
{11874}{11933}I mean, I love her, you know?
{11939}{12001}And I love the milk!
{12007}{12122}But I won't ask some British girl|to move in with me.
{12195}{12280}Joey, you say things now.
{12280}{12352}Look, Ross. He's right.|Emily's great.
{12358}{12380}She's great!
{12386}{12468}But this is too soon.|You'll only scare her.
{12474}{12506}I don't want to do that.
{12512}{12592}You don't want to wreck it.|Don't go too fast.
{12598}{12653}No. You're right.|I know, you're right.
{12659}{12724}I'm not going to do it.
{12730}{12791}- Thanks guys.|- No problem.
{12797}{12901}Just remember to wake us up|before you go-go.
{13123}{13216}It's too hard. Too hard!
{13218}{13277}All right.|Last chance for the tickets.
{13283}{13406}Otherwise, I give them to my|new boyfriend, Joshua.
{13412}{13449}No, thank you.
{13455}{13531}Wait, wait. Come on, come on!|Let's trade.
{13537}{13646}The timing's perfect!|I just clogged the toilet!
{13667}{13763}I want those seats. But we can't live|in the small apartment...
{13769}{13877}...after living here!|Ever read "Flowers for Algernon"?
{13893}{13973}Ever read "Sports Illustrated"?
{13985}{14029}No, I didn't read yours!
{14035}{14075}We can go to the game tonight!
{14081}{14134}The only way I'll consider this is...
{14140}{14199}...if they offer more|than just season seats.
{14205}{14224}It's the Knicks!
{14230}{14300}Screw the Knicks!
{14390}{14450}I didn't mean that.|I just meant that...
{14456}{14565}...the apartment is worth|so much more.
{14624}{14651}And the Knicks rule.
{14657}{14727}Yeah, the Knicks rule!
{14728}{14796}So? Are you going to do it?
{14802}{14877}No, we're not going to|because it's not an even trade.
{14883}{14906}All right, look.
{14912}{14985}What if you could keep the apartment|and the tickets?
{14991}{15029}Done!
{15035}{15114}Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet.|Winner takes all.
{15120}{15148}We could get nothing.
{15154}{15184}Or everything.
{15190}{15261}I like that.
{15263}{15306}What do you say?
{15312}{15335}Just do it!
{15341}{15415}Oh! I'm convinced!
{15428}{15504}Come on, man!|You know I'd do it for you.
{15510}{15582}Because you're my best friend.
{15588}{15688}All right. But you can't|use that again for a whole year.
{15694}{15734}I'm in.
{15740}{15814}This is so exciting!|What are you going to bet?
{15820}{15870}We should let Phoebe decide...
{15876}{16010}...because she's the only one|who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
{16073}{16108}I have a game!
{16114}{16174}- This is great!|- What's the game?
{16180}{16290}It doesn't have a name.|No, okay. Phoebe Ball!
{16298}{16385}No, it doesn't have a name.
{16419}{16545}What is your favorite thing|about trees?
{16560}{16652}- They're green?|- Good! Five points!
{16775}{16855}Same question.
{16900}{16988}- They're tall.|- Three points!
{17014}{17159}Both fine answers, but we were|looking for leafy. Leafy.
{17179}{17209}That's not even a game.
{17215}{17302}Shut up. We're winning!
{17308}{17368}You want to finish this?|We get a deck of cards.
{17374}{17414}High card wins.|What do you say?
{17420}{17473}- Let's do it!|- Oh, I have cards!
{17479}{17514}Yeah. Here.
{17520}{17587}No, these are the trick deck.
{17593}{17637}Here, yes.
{17643}{17735}Okay, you guys pick first.
{17814}{17909}- Four.|- That's a low one!
{17953}{17989}You look.|I can't do it.
{17995}{18079}What makes you think I can?
{18085}{18145}Ace!
{18213}{18248}Why are you hugging?
{18254}{18291}We won our apartment back!
{18297}{18374}What? Ace is high!|Jack, queen, king, ace!
{18380}{18482}No! Ace is low!|Ace, two, three, four!
{18632}{18700}I don't know.
{18752}{18815}Look it!
{18863}{18930}Come on, pick again!
{18977}{19077}Come on, apartment!|Come on, apartment!
{19120}{19173}I know queen is high!
{19179}{19239}Not as high as...
{19245}{19322}It worked! King!
{19358}{19397}We pick again!|We pick again!
{19403}{19475}- Why?|- I don't know.
{19484}{19556}Tickets, please.
{19573}{19637}Courtside, baby!
{19652}{19755}Seriously, good game, though.|Good game.
{19755}{19857}What are they so mad about?|They got the apartment back.
{19863}{19931}No, they didn't.
{20149}{20194}Packed while you were gone.
{20200}{20291}I left knickers under your pillow.
{20300}{20354}Move in with me?
{20360}{20379}What?
{20385}{20497}Don't be scared. It sounds crazy,|and people will say it's too soon...
{20503}{20655}...but just think.|Think how great it would be.
{20680}{20756}I don't know.
{20762}{20804}Leaving London...
{20810}{20858}My whole family lives there...
{20864}{20929}- My job.|- You'll get a job here.
{20935}{21031}I always hear about them foreigners|stealing American jobs.
{21037}{21086}That could be you.
{21092}{21158}Yeah, but it's my whole life.
{21164}{21194}You come to England.
{21200}{21271}I would. I really would.|But my son is here.
{21277}{21409}I can't leave him.|You don't think there's any way?
{21417}{21481}I don't think so.
{21487}{21564}It would be different if it was|way into the future...
{21570}{21627}...and we were getting married.
{21633}{21677}What?
{21683}{21824}Right. I shouldn't have said "married".|Please don't go freaky on me.
{21830}{21883}I didn't mean it.|I take it back.
{21889}{21957}No. Don't.
{21980}{22024}Why don't we?
{22030}{22097}Why don't we what?
{22119}{22188}Get married.
{22194}{22217}You are mad!
{22223}{22339}No, I'm not! It's perfect.|It's better than you moving here.
{22345}{22419}It's us together forever,|and that's what I want.
{22425}{22484}- We've known each other six weeks!|- I know.
{22490}{22577}So what? Who's to say?|Does that mean we can't do it?
{22583}{22683}Look. I was with Carol for|four years before we got married...
{22689}{22804}...and I wound up divorced|from a pregnant lesbian.
{22825}{22874}I mean, this...
{22880}{22961}This makes sense for us.
{22967}{23078}Our first date, we ended up|spending the whole weekend in Vermont.
{23084}{23194}I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.|Me!
{23202}{23252}This feels right.
{23258}{23318}Doesn't it?
{23325}{23383}My parents will be really mad.
{23389}{23467}Are you saying, "Yes"?|Is that "Yes"?
{23473}{23530}Yes.
{23615}{23686}- We're getting married!|- Oh, my God!
{23692}{23753}We're getting married!
{23759}{23830}Come here, come here.
{24044}{24115}Emily, will you marry me?
{24252}{24308}It's a bit small.
{24314}{24422}Damn! I thought that'd be|romantic as hell.
{24464}{24531}It was.
{24818}{24887}Those were, like,|the best seats ever!
{24893}{24980}Should we give these to the girls?|Like a peace offering?
{24986}{25099}That's very nice.|Plus, they were free and too small.
{25198}{25267}Oh, God!
{25388}{25460}Hey, you want a beer?
{25513}{25581}I know!
{25623}{25703}Open up! Open up! Open up!
{25709}{25797}We'll discuss it in the morning.
{25943}{26007}What the hell is going on?
{26013}{26118}We took our apartment back!
{26167}{26245}I had nothing to do with it.
{26288}{26411}Okay, it was my idea.|But I don't feel good about it.
{26473}{26541}We are switching back right now.
{26547}{26589}No, we're not.|We're not leaving!
{26595}{26644}You'll have to.|You both have jobs.
{26650}{26733}As soon as you do, we'll switch back!|You can't stop us.
{26739}{26769}Right, Joe?
{26775}{26838}I don't know.
{26897}{26928}What?
{26934}{27030}I don't want to move again, with...
{27045}{27109}This is our apartment|and they stole...
{27115}{27166}You stole!
{27172}{27244}Our apartment!|We won it fair and square. Twice!
{27250}{27380}And I am getting it back right now!|I'm getting it back right now!
{27380}{27428}All right.
{27434}{27542}We figured you might respond|this way, so we have a backup offer.
{27548}{27620}No more offers.|You can't offer anything to us!
{27626}{27765}- Let us keep the apartment and...|- As a thank you...
{27808}{27915}...Rachel and I will kiss|for one minute.
{27970}{28039}- Totally worth it!|- That was one good minute!
{28045}{28107}Good night.
{28210}{28273}- Men are such idiots.|- I know.
{28279}{28389}Can you believe something that stupid|actually got us our apartment back?
{28395}{28472}If you had just done that|after the last contest...
{28478}{28570}...no one would have|had to move at all.
{28610}{28700}Let's pretend that's not true.
{28743}{28816}Scarf's done.
{28872}{28942}Come on, come on!
{28986}{29008}What's going on?
{29014}{29115}Ross has some big thing|to tell everyone.
{29177}{29237}Emily and I, we decided...
{29243}{29310}...to get married.
{29355}{29386}What?
{29392}{29485}Oh, are you pregnant too?
{29537}{29610}When did...|How did you...
{29616}{29682}We just decided to go for it.
{29688}{29761}We know it's a bit hasty...
{29767}{29856}...but it just feels so right.
{29934}{29984}I was just telling the guys...
{29990}{30075}Yeah, I heard.
{30184}{30245}I think it's great!
{30251}{30284}I'm so happy for you!
{30290}{30372}Well, yeah!|Congratulations!
{30546}{30640}I can't believe|you're getting married!
{30700}{30786}Monica and Rachel made out.
{31005}{31102}{y:i}Morning's here
{31108}{31169}{y:i}The morning's here
{31175}{31236}{y:i}Sunshine is here
{31242}{31277}{y:i}The sky is clear
{31283}{31341}{y:i}The morning's here
{31347}{31426}- Hey, you're back!|{y:i}- Hey, get into gear
{31432}{31474}{y:i}Breakfast is near
{31480}{31601}{y:i}The dark of night has disappeared
{31607}{31706}I'll see you tomorrow morning!
{290}{375}Are you kidding me?
{388}{455}Joey?
{1037}{1125}Did I wake you?
{1143}{1219}The One with|All the Wedding Dresses
{2297}{2403}Gunther, could I get|another cup of coffee?
{2425}{2496}So what do you do when|you're not working here?
{2502}{2624}- You don't need to fill these silences.|- Okay, thanks.
{2632}{2688}That's your fourth cup of coffee.
{2694}{2783}I'm exhausted because|Joey started snoring.
{2789}{2839}He's in a different room.|He's that loud?
{2845}{2912}You should hear me.
{2918}{2996}It's nothing to be proud of.|Go to a sleep clinic.
{3002}{3061}I'm not going to any clinic.
{3067}{3128}I don't have a problem.|You have the problem.
{3134}{3231}You should go to a "Quit-being-|a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.
{3237}{3282}- They don't have those.|- Yeah, they do.
{3288}{3339}Quit being a baby and leave me alone!
{3345}{3420}There, you just had your first class.
{3426}{3482}I used to date a light sleeper.
{3488}{3541}Whenever I snored,|he rolled me over...
{3547}{3624}Oh, yeah!
{3668}{3728}He'd roll me over,|and I'd stop snoring.
{3734}{3805}Next time you snore,|I'm rolling you over!
{3811}{3920}I gotta do what I gotta do.|You gotta do what you gotta do.
{3926}{3993}Hey, guys.
{4059}{4132}Oh, the Olympics!
{4157}{4196}Have you picked a date?
{4202}{4226}No. Not yet.
{4232}{4318}I still cannot believe|you're engaged.
{4324}{4440}Because it's so fast.|Not because you're a loser.
{4442}{4502}Thanks.|Has anyone seen Rach?
{4508}{4554}She's upstairs not doing the dishes.
{4560}{4665}I won't do them this time.|Even if they sit there until...
{4671}{4770}I'll do them when I get home.
{4793}{4859}Emily found this|wedding dress in London...
{4865}{4886}Already?
{4892}{4917}But it didn't fit.
{4923}{4994}There's a store here|with one left in her size.
{5000}{5029}But the groom can't see...
{5035}{5079}- I'll pick it up for you.|- Thanks.
{5085}{5185}She's got you running errands,|picking up wedding dresses...
{5191}{5263}Wah-pah!
{5290}{5339}What's wah-pah?
{5345}{5386}You know. Whipped.
{5392}{5459}Wah-pah!
{5492}{5535}That's not whipped.
{5541}{5621}Whipped is...
{5637}{5712}That's what I did.
{5752}{5836}You can't do anything!
{6158}{6270}Hey, Mon.|I was just doing these dishes.
{6292}{6331}Do you have a minute?
{6337}{6443}I was just about to|take a break anyway.
{6447}{6520}So listen...
{6521}{6576}...I know we haven't had|a chance to talk...
{6582}{6651}...since Emily and I|decided to get married.
{6657}{6758}And I was just wondering|how you were.
{6762}{6908}If you were getting married,|I would feel kind of...
{6928}{6972}You know?
{6978}{7101}It definitely took me by surprise.|But, you know...
{7107}{7170}...I'm okay.
{7178}{7216}I just wanted to check.
{7222}{7308}That's sweet. Thank you.
{7313}{7336}You're great.
{7342}{7463}And I know someday this will|happen for you too.
{7478}{7557}You just hang in there.
{7582}{7621}"Hang in there"?
{7627}{7667}No, I didn't mean...
{7673}{7815}You haven't heard of a serious|relationship called "me and Joshua"?
{7832}{7898}I thought you had|just been on four dates.
{7904}{7991}I didn't realize that had|become anything.
{7997}{8069}Oh no, it has become.
{8075}{8180}Oh no, those were four great dates.
{8189}{8255}I mean, and the connection!
{8261}{8341}Emotionally, mentally.|You know?
{8347}{8418}Physically.
{8424}{8481}- That's incredible.|- I know, isn't it?
{8487}{8572}I'm right there with Joshua.|You are right there with Emily.
{8578}{8691}And it's kind of like it's a tie.
{8753}{8799}I gotta get back to my dishes.
{8805}{8875}I gotta get to work.
{8981}{9029}You know what would|make me happy?
{9035}{9077}You know, what's that?
{9083}{9175}If the four of us could all,|you know, hang out together.
{9181}{9235}Emily's coming into|town this weekend.
{9241}{9321}Why don't we all|have dinner Sunday night?
{9327}{9382}That would be great!
{9388}{9450}All right. It's a date!
{9456}{9563}"Hang in there."|You hang in there.
{9575}{9674}- Did you say something?|- No, just singing.
{9792}{9875}Oh, my God!
{9906}{9966}Look at this one!
{9972}{10041}It's so beautiful.
{10058}{10164}About half of these will|end up getting divorced.
{10170}{10201}May I help you ladies?
{10207}{10267}I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.
{10273}{10303}What's the name?
{10309}{10418}- Emily Waltham.|- Yes, I have it right here.
{10530}{10633}Would you like to try it on,|Miss Waltham?
{10896}{10992}You're the most beautiful bride|I've ever seen.
{10998}{11074}I am, aren't I?
{11082}{11138}Miss Waltham?
{11144}{11205}We're closing.
{11231}{11270}All right.
{11276}{11359}And could I get my ring back?
{11603}{11700}All right, buddy.|Time to roll over.
{11838}{11953}You are going to a clinic!|You're going to a clinic!
{11955}{12035}And a pajama store!
{12118}{12156}Does she use the cups?
{12162}{12250}Yes, I believe she does.
{12253}{12380}Does she use the plates?|Yes, I believe she does!
{12568}{12625}Thank you.
{12671}{12730}Thank you very much.
{12736}{12823}Thank you for coming.
{12878}{12971}- Just a second.|- No, no! Let me in!
{12977}{13005}Can you hold on a minute?
{13011}{13115}No! You have to|let me in right now!
{13118}{13179}Are you alone?
{13188}{13254}All right.
{13420}{13450}This sucks.
{13456}{13552}I have to stay up all night|before I go to the stupid clinic.
{13558}{13628}I'm so tired.
{13628}{13690}It's six o'clock.
{13726}{13806}I hear you and Joshua are|going out with Ross and Emily.
{13812}{13862}I think that's really cool.
{13868}{13937}I think you're handling|that really well.
{13943}{13979}"Handling it"?
{13985}{14034}There's nothing to handle.
{14040}{14146}Maybe I'd have a problem with this|if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
{14152}{14233}They're not going to|get married anyway.
{14239}{14333}They rushed into this thing|so fast, it's ridiculous!
{14339}{14404}They'll be engaged for like what?|A year?
{14410}{14476}One of them will realize|what they've done...
{14482}{14512}...and call it off.
{14518}{14601}You'll be dancing at my wedding|before you dance at theirs.
{14607}{14666}You know, I don't dance at weddings.
{14672}{14691}Why not?
{14697}{14757}Weddings are a great place|to meet women.
{14763}{14838}When I dance,|I look like this.
{15064}{15134}Hey, man.
{15145}{15201}What are you doing|four weeks from today?
{15207}{15236}- Nothing.|- Nothing.
{15242}{15311}I am...
{15326}{15377}...free.
{15383}{15482}Because we're getting|married in a month.
{15525}{15554}In a month?
{15560}{15624}You mean 30 days?
{15630}{15675}From now?
{15681}{15736}That's great!
{15742}{15832}She always wanted to get married|where her parents did...
{15838}{15897}...but it's getting torn down.
{15903}{15994}I know it's crazy,|but everything's been so crazy...
{16000}{16047}...and it just feels right.
{16053}{16173}Hey, that's the day after|I start menstruating!
{16396}{16473}This isn't mine.
{16723}{16763}What's up?
{16769}{16837}Your voice sounded|all squeaky on the phone.
{16843}{16897}Nothing.|I just wanted to see you.
{16903}{16966}See you and hug you.
{16972}{17002}See you...
{17008}{17074}Great!
{17078}{17143}Sit.
{17186}{17229}You okay?
{17235}{17387}I'm more than okay.|I am really, really happy.
{17412}{17457}Want to know why?
{17463}{17504}Do I?
{17510}{17585}Because I am really happy about us.
{17591}{17644}I think we are so|on the right track.
{17650}{17751}I think we are working.|I think we are clicking.
{17757}{17805}- You know?|- Yeah, sure, sure.
{17811}{17851}We're clicking.
{17857}{17915}If there was just|one little area where...
{17921}{17991}...I think we need to work on,|I would think...
{17997}{18102}...it's that we're|just not crazy enough.
{18108}{18207}I got to say, I'm not too sure|I agree with that.
{18213}{18264}You know, yeah, you're right.
{18270}{18346}We have our fun. Yeah?
{18391}{18482}I mean, like crazy!|You know?
{18488}{18540}All right.
{18546}{18637}This is going to sound, you know,|a little hasty.
{18643}{18723}But just go with me.
{18788}{18890}What if we got married?
{18936}{19001}Oh, I know. It's so totally like...
{19007}{19080}..."Whoa, can we do this?"|You know?
{19086}{19165}But it just feels right.|Don't you think it does?
{19171}{19273}I mean, it just feels right.|Don't you...?
{19338}{19372}Rachel...
{19378}{19419}...you're...
{19425}{19460}...a real...
{19466}{19547}...special lady.
{19577}{19643}But my divorce isn't final yet...
{19649}{19738}...and we've been on four dates.
{19742}{19820}So I'm thinking: No...
{19826}{19863}...but...
{19869}{19929}...thanks.
{19951}{20026}You idiot!
{20123}{20179}- Your name, please?|- Joey Tribbiani.
{20185}{20292}Did you stay up all night|in preparation for your study?
{20298}{20356}Sir?
{20395}{20428}Yes, he did.
{20434}{20545}All right. We'll call you|in a few minutes.
{20612}{20696}Check out that girl.|She's really hot.
{20702}{20773}Yeah, she is.
{20843}{20913}How you doing?
{20958}{21081}- What?|- You're coming on to the entire room.
{21200}{21249}- I'm Chandler.|- I'm Marjorie.
{21255}{21299}- Do you mind if I sit?|- Please.
{21305}{21339}So what are you in for?
{21345}{21386}I talk in my sleep.
{21392}{21483}What a coincidence!|I listen in my sleep.
{21489}{21578}So why don't you give me your number?
{21622}{21693}Are you ready?
{21736}{21810}I got it! Mine!
{21858}{21933}- Congratulations!|- Thank you!
{21939}{22002}My turn, my turn!
{22023}{22088}Okay, ready?
{22278}{22326}That was a terrible throw!
{22332}{22432}I won't throw it right to you.|That's not real.
{22436}{22546}Look at me. My big concern|is what's real?
{22600}{22646}Oh, my God!
{22652}{22734}We're really sad, aren't we?
{22768}{22835}Yeah, I think we are.
{22840}{22879}This isn't even my dress.
{22885}{23043}At least you didn't rent yours from|a store called "It's Not Too Late."
{23163}{23247}- I'm changing out of this.|- Me, too.
{23253}{23281}In half an hour?
{23287}{23337}Me, too.
{23343}{23424}All right, now throw it|straight this time.
{23430}{23501}I'm getting married!
{23616}{23697}I hate my regular clothes now.
{23703}{23728}I look down and I know...
{23734}{23838}...this won't be the most|special day of my life.
{23858}{23917}I mean, it was kind of|fun for a while...
{23923}{23970}...but didn't you feel kind of silly?
{23976}{24043}I guess.
{24051}{24123}Oh, my God!
{24138}{24200}You're such a cheater!
{24206}{24272}Hello, little ones.
{24278}{24320}- So, is Joey going to stop snoring?|- Yep!
{24326}{24394}And a beautiful woman|agreed to go out with me.
{24400}{24501}Joey wanted to ask her out,|but, you know, she picked me.
{24507}{24570}How'd that happen?
{24576}{24639}Because I'm cooler.
{24645}{24704}No, seriously.
{24733}{24844}She's the kind of girl...|Joey was unconscious.
{24878}{24949}Hey, you guys!|What's happening?
{24955}{24984}Oh, my God!
{24990}{25013}What is that?
{25019}{25080}They gave it to me|at the sleep clinic...
{25086}{25177}...and it's going to help me|not to snore.
{25183}{25257}Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?
{25263}{25322}You don't have to|wear it unless you are.
{25328}{25387}I know I don't have to.
{25393}{25463}It tastes good.
{25469}{25548}Plus, you look cool.
{25674}{25711}I just called Joshua.
{25717}{25747}How'd it go?
{25753}{25814}I did my best to|convince him that I'm not...
{25820}{25881}...some crazy girl who's|dying to get married.
{25887}{25927}And I'm going through|a hard time.
{25933}{25954}What'd he say?
{25960}{26060}His answering machine|was very understanding.
{26125}{26204}I feel blue.
{26232}{26287}I bet you anything|he'll call you again.
{26293}{26392}Yeah, maybe. But, you know,|I don't think I even care.
{26398}{26509}I don't think he's|the one I'm sad about.
{26515}{26607}I know I said I'm totally okay|with Ross getting married.
{26613}{26657}But as it turns out...
{26663}{26742}...I don't think I'm handling it|all that well.
{26748}{26810}Yeah, maybe.
{26811}{26872}And I'm just trying to|figure out why.
{26878}{26916}Any luck?
{26922}{27052}You know how Ross and I have|always been on again, off again?
{27058}{27134}I guess I just figured,|somewhere down the road...
{27140}{27187}...we would be on again.
{27193}{27247}Again.
{27253}{27346}You know what?|I think we all did.
{27543}{27596}I got us reservations|for Sunday night.
{27602}{27643}How about Ernie's at 9:00?
{27649}{27735}Well, you'd better make it for three.
{27741}{27858}I don't know if we're|going to be hungry at three.
{27892}{27929}Three people.
{27935}{27982}Joshua's not going to be there.
{27988}{28014}What happened?
{28020}{28095}Well, I think he broke up with me.
{28101}{28159}No. Why?
{28165}{28242}Apparently, he scares easy.
{28248}{28315}Rachel, I'm sorry.
{28321}{28380}It's okay.
{28386}{28542}Sometimes things don't work out|the way you thought they would.
{28542}{28613}Come here.
{28743}{28843}Don't you have to go pick up Emily?
{28871}{28906}Are you okay?
{28912}{28990}I got my girls.
{29429}{29502}Hey, you know what might|cheer you up?
{29508}{29566}What?
{29632}{29663}I got to tell you...
{29669}{29774}...this really does put me|in a better mood.
{29777}{29886}I wish there was a job where|I could wear this all the time.
{29892}{29975}Maybe someday there will be.
{29992}{30081}Chandler's coming by to borrow|candles for his big date.
{30087}{30154}Rachel, don't get it!|He'll see us!
{30160}{30207}The groom cannot see the bride.
{30213}{30257}I'm not going to marry Chandler.
{30263}{30344}Not after this!
{30350}{30444}Okay guys, just relax.
{30533}{30595}I do!
{30665}{30738}I got to go.
{30841}{30940}Yeah, well, that ought to do it.
{31003}{31077}Food's here. Fair enough.
{31083}{31168}Fifteen-minute warning.
{31530}{31654}Dude, I am trying to sleep!
{94}{163}All of a sudden,|so much is happening.
{169}{224}I know.|Ross is getting married.
{230}{305}Phoebe's making people.
{311}{370}- Everybody's doing stuff.|- We just sit here.
{376}{433}If I died,|people would know I was here...
{439}{531}...only by the ass print|on this chair!
{537}{626}We have to do something.|Something huge!
{632}{688}We could climb Mt. Everest.
{694}{765}Not something stupid.|Something huge!
{771}{822}I saw an ad for this video.
{828}{905}People climb that thing every day.|We could totally do that!
{911}{988}Why not?|I mean, it's just climbing.
{994}{1067}It's just steep!
{1074}{1197}We're going! It'd be nice|to leave an ass print on Everest.
{1218}{1238}What's up?
{1244}{1313}- We're gonna climb Mt. Everest.|- Yeah, baby!
{1319}{1358}I looked into that.
{1364}{1493}Yeah, but it costs like $60,000,|and, you know, you could die.
{1499}{1579}And you would die.
{1638}{1686}We could get that Everest video.
{1692}{1781}We could do that|without risking our lives at all.
{1787}{1898}While we're at the video store,|we could rent "Die Hard"!
{1924}{1955}I just remembered.
{1961}{2065}That Everest thing is only available|through mail order.
{2071}{2169}So you'll stay here|and hang out with me?
{2201}{2248}But one of these days...
{2254}{2370}...we'll get off our butts|and rent "Die Hard" again!
{2388}{2463}The One with the Invitation
{3554}{3635}So does your uncle Nathan|get an invite or not?
{3641}{3688}Oh, God!|Nobody likes him.
{3694}{3791}He's so cheap. He'd never fly|to London in a million years.
{3797}{3862}Invite him!
{3871}{3943}Did I do these neat enough?
{3949}{3998}Yeah, they're fine.
{4004}{4088}We'll say that Ben addressed them.
{4094}{4156}You invited Rachel then?
{4162}{4191}Sure, why not?
{4197}{4247}Really?
{4253}{4357}I wouldn't be comfortable having|any of my old lovers there.
{4363}{4427}Do you think|we shouldn't invite her?
{4433}{4498}You know I absolutely adore Rachel.
{4504}{4601}It's just that I thought|it might be awkward for you.
{4607}{4665}But it's absolutely your decision.
{4671}{4742}- More tea?|- Sure.
{4744}{4792}Earl Grey?
{4798}{4879}Fine, invite whoever you want.
{4964}{5124}I don't want to be single, okay?|I just want to be married again.
{5197}{5299}And I just want a million dollars!
{5328}{5437}Oh God, Monica. Thank God!
{5453}{5531}This is Rachel.|Another Lincoln High survivor.
{5537}{5567}This is Chandler.
{5573}{5600}Phoebe.
{5606}{5632}Joey.
{5638}{5718}- Do you remember Ross?|- Sure.
{5779}{5823}Back in high school...
{5829}{5918}...I had a major crush on you.
{5924}{5946}I knew.
{5952}{6019}You did?
{6029}{6113}I figured you thought|I was Monica's geeky brother.
{6119}{6189}I did.
{6206}{6248}Listen, do you think...
{6254}{6374}Try not to let my intense|vulnerability become a factor.
{6388}{6493}Would it be okay|if I asked you out sometime?
{6529}{6597}Maybe.
{6621}{6704}Okay, maybe I will.
{6721}{6770}See, I see...
{6776}{6835}...big passion in your future.
{6841}{6877}- Really?|- I do.
{6883}{6999}Ross, you're so great.
{7199}{7285}It's never gonna happen.
{7293}{7374}I have a question.
{7377}{7446}Actually, it's not|so much a question.
{7452}{7526}It's more of a general wondering...
{7532}{7604}...ment.
{7666}{7789}Well, for a while now,|I've been wanting to...
{7829}{7850}That's right.
{7856}{7896}Look!
{7902}{7968}What?
{7976}{8038}{y:i}Top of the world looking
{8044}{8082}{y:i}Down on creation
{8088}{8217}{y:i}And the only explanation I can find
{8223}{8374}Listen, missy! If you want this cart,|you'll have to take me with it!
{8468}{8513}- Did you see that?|- You were incredible!
{8519}{8579}A brand-new woman,|ladies and gentlemen.
{8585}{8679}I could not have done this|without you.
{8854}{8934}More clothes in the dryer?
{8953}{8977}I'm fine.
{8983}{9072}You had no right to tell me|you had feelings for me.
{9078}{9140}I was doing great with Julie|before I found out.
{9146}{9257}I was doing great too. It's not|easy for me to see you with Julie.
{9263}{9330}I don't need this right now.
{9336}{9374}It's too late.
{9380}{9450}I'm with somebody else.|This ship has sailed!
{9456}{9514}All right, fine!|Go ahead and do that.
{9520}{9614}I don't need your stupid ship!
{10744}{10827}This is the first time I'm doing|something I care about.
{10833}{10918}I'm doing something|that I'm actually good at.
{10924}{10957}If you don't get that...
{10963}{11057}I get that, but I'm tired|of your answering machine.
{11063}{11121}I don't know what to do.
{11127}{11158}Neither do I!
{11164}{11228}Is this about Mark?
{11237}{11257}Oh, my God!
{11263}{11318}Okay, it's not.
{11324}{11402}I can't keep having this|same fight over and over again.
{11408}{11470}You're making this too hard!
{11476}{11527}I am?|What do you want me to do?
{11533}{11627}I don't know. Look, maybe|we should just take a break.
{11633}{11703}You're right. Let's cool off.
{11709}{11809}Let's get some frozen yogurt|or something.
{11837}{11917}A break from us.
{11992}{12083}- Why are we rushing?|- The girlfriend I told you about.
{12089}{12161}She wants to get back|together with me.
{12167}{12190}I found it!
{12196}{12268}That's so great for you guys!
{12274}{12384}- Good luck with your girlfriend.|- Thank you.
{12563}{12638}- You got my message?|- You are right on time.
{12644}{12699}Can I be your girlfriend again?
{12705}{12778}You can very much.
{12834}{12877}I want you to leave.|Get out!
{12883}{12938}I want to talk about this.
{12944}{13023}All right, how was she?
{13138}{13157}Was she good?
{13163}{13224}Don't answer!
{13244}{13353}You wanted to talk about it.|How was she?
{13359}{13379}She was...
{13385}{13488}- She was not good, not good.|- Nothing compared to you.
{13494}{13555}She was different.
{13596}{13662}Good different?
{13668}{13733}Nobody likes change.
{13739}{13798}Just stop!
{13804}{13853}The way you owned up to everything.
{13859}{13968}It's just showed me|how much you've grown, you know?
{13974}{14078}I mean, my mom never thought|this would work out.
{14084}{14209}She was all,|"Once a cheater, always a cheater."
{14268}{14350}I just wish we hadn't lost|those four months.
{14356}{14507}But if time was what you needed|just to gain a little perspective.
{14533}{14647}We were on a break!
{14867}{14904}You seem to really like her.
{14910}{15000}What do I do?|We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.
{15006}{15059}No commitment.
{15065}{15176}That girl just spent the entire evening|talking to your friends...
{15182}{15240}...asking to hear stories about you...
{15246}{15309}...Iooking through|Monica's photo albums.
{15315}{15399}You don't do that|if you're just in it for two weeks.
{15405}{15441}You think?
{15447}{15547}You've got 14 hours until|she has to be at the airport.
{15553}{15606}And you're sitting here|in a hallway...
{15612}{15727}...with a 28-year-old cheerleader|with a fat lip.
{15777}{15835}You're right.
{16094}{16140}This is so amazing!
{16146}{16212}My brother's getting married|and in London!
{16218}{16293}It's so romantic.
{16299}{16346}Hey, pretty smart!
{16352}{16377}Tissue paper.
{16383}{16441}You're at the wedding.|You have to cry.
{16447}{16542}Handkerchief?|No, I got my invitation.
{16564}{16599}Isn't this adorable?
{16605}{16704}Ross let Ben address mine.
{16744}{16849}Did you get your invitation|to Ross' wedding?
{16882}{16969}Don't worry, I get to bring a guest.|We'll show him.
{16975}{17013}I'm so jealous you're all going.
{17019}{17094}I never knew you can't fly|in your third trimester.
{17100}{17127}I didn't, either.
{17133}{17185}I knew that.
{17191}{17296}So I didn't know that.|But you should see your faces.
{17302}{17341}What's up?
{17347}{17424}Just hanging out.
{17519}{17598}What's this?|Ross' wedding invitation?
{17604}{17688}Maybe that's the one|we should have hidden.
{17694}{17769}No, you guys, come on.|You don't have to do that.
{17775}{17818}I'm happy for him.
{17824}{17887}I am. I really...
{17893}{17949}I'll work on it.
{17955}{18017}I'm sorry.
{18059}{18122}You're going to come, though,|aren't you?
{18128}{18170}I don't know.
{18176}{18258}This isn't one of those|"If she doesn't come, we don't come"?
{18264}{18362}Because I already bought my ticket.
{18392}{18492}You know what would be real weird?|If you weren't there.
{18498}{18619}- Just say you'll think about it.|- I'll think about it.
{18669}{18693}Who's this from?
{18699}{18756}That's Ross'.
{18867}{18928}Oh, my God!
{18934}{18968}He remembered.
{18974}{19003}Remembered what?
{19009}{19098}It was months ago.|We were walking by this antique store.
{19104}{19188}I saw this and told him|it was like one my grandmother had...
{19194}{19250}...when I was a little girl.
{19256}{19307}I can't believe he remembered!
{19313}{19349}This must've cost a fortune.
{19355}{19382}I can't believe he did this.
{19388}{19452}Remember when he fell in love|with Carol...
{19458}{19555}...and got her|that expensive crystal duck?
{19561}{19624}What did you just say?
{19866}{19935}Oh, my God!
{19941}{20046}Flight number 457|from Beijing now arriving.
{20112}{20135}Oh, my God!
{20141}{20208}- We were in school together.|- We haven't seen each other since.
{20214}{20304}I land in China.|Guess who's in charge of the dig?
{20310}{20374}Julie!
{20376}{20418}Isn't that great?
{20424}{20564}Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,|spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
{20599}{20694}That is so sweet!
{20759}{20788}No, you hang up.
{20794}{20869}No, you...
{20869}{20974}One, two, three.
{20991}{21020}You didn't hang up!
{21026}{21109}She didn't hang up either.
{21203}{21231}No, you hang up.
{21237}{21329}You!
{21401}{21443}Ross, hi.
{21449}{21491}It's Rachel.
{21497}{21598}I'm just calling to say|that everything's fine.
{21604}{21653}And I'm really happy for you...
{21659}{21743}...and your cat.
{21771}{21843}Obviously, I am over you.
{21849}{21923}I am over you.
{21929}{22086}And that, my friend,|is what they call closure.
{22117}{22158}I got a message from you.
{22164}{22223}Oh, my God!|Hang up the phone!
{22229}{22314}Give me the phone!
{22468}{22513}You're over me?
{22519}{22589}Oh, God.
{22623}{22687}You're over me?
{22719}{22767}When were you...
{22773}{22849}...under me?
{22887}{22918}Basically...
{22924}{23009}...lately, I've...
{23017}{23100}I've sort of had feelings for you.
{23106}{23171}I need to lie down.
{23180}{23245}He broke up with Julie!
{23251}{23354}Go hug her, for God's sakes!
{23359}{23419}Really?
{23437}{23493}It's always been you, Rach.
{23499}{23566}Oh, God.
{23733}{23805}Listen, I'm sorry|I had to work tonight.
{23811}{23847}That's okay.
{23853}{23918}You're worth the wait.
{23924}{24014}And I don't just mean tonight.
{24621}{24678}Oh, God!
{24684}{24711}Honey.
{24717}{24775}That's okay.
{24781}{24878}No, you just rolled over|the juice box.
{24932}{25056}Did you say anything to Rachel about|me and the girl from the copy place?
{25062}{25095}I'm sorry.
{25101}{25184}Was I not supposed to?
{25314}{25350}You ended it!
{25356}{25481}Because I was mad at you.|Not because I stopped loving you.
{25487}{25545}You still love me?
{25589}{25712}What does this mean?|Do you want to get back together?
{25718}{25778}Maybe.
{25784}{25838}I don't know.
{25844}{25934}I just, I feel...
{26111}{26258}I can't believe I even thought of|getting back together. We're so over!
{26268}{26333}Fine by me!
{26339}{26423}And hey! Just so you know,|it's not that common.
{26429}{26533}It doesn't happen to every guy,|and it is a big deal.
{26539}{26619}I knew it!
{26856}{26960}{y:i}Rachel's coming up.|{y:i}Doesn't she look pretty?
{26966}{26998}Oh, my God!
{27004}{27068}This is us getting ready|for the prom.
{27074}{27121}We don't have to watch this.
{27127}{27150}Yeah, we do!
{27156}{27190}Come on!
{27196}{27272}{y:i}- Get a shot of Monica.|{y:i}- How do you zoom out?
{27278}{27358}{y:i}There she is!
{27362}{27430}Shut up!|The camera adds 10 pounds.
{27436}{27523}So how many cameras|are actually on you?
{27529}{27572}{y:i}Dad, turn it off!
{27578}{27606}{y:i}It is off.
{27612}{27686}{y:i}Right, Ross?
{27762}{27850}Looking good, Mr. Kotter!
{27869}{27965}{y:i}I can't go to my prom without a date.|{y:i}It's too late.
{27971}{28048}{y:i}If you're not going,|{y:i}then I don't want to go either.
{28054}{28101}{y:i}I have a wonderful idea.
{28107}{28160}{y:i}You should take Rachel to the prom.
{28166}{28208}We've seen enough.|Let's turn it off.
{28214}{28287}- I want to see!|- Fine, I'm not going to watch.
{28293}{28340}{y:i}Come on, kid. Let's go.
{28346}{28388}{y:i}Are you handsome!
{28394}{28469}{y:i}Let's show them!
{28532}{28592}{y:i}- Okay, Dad.|{y:i}- Rachel, ready or not.
{28598}{28694}{y:i}Here comes your knight in shining...
{28829}{28868}{y:i}Oh, dear!
{28874}{28950}{y:i}How do I turn this off?
{28969}{29055}I can't believe you did that.
{29500}{29592}See? He's her lobster!
{29841}{29907}You're really not going?
{29913}{29977}It's just going to be too hard.
{29983}{30033}You know, I mean...
{30039}{30093}...it's Ross.
{30099}{30188}How can I watch him get married?
{30194}{30273}It's just for the best.|You know? It is.
{30279}{30343}Plus somebody's got|to stay here with Phoebe.
{30349}{30415}She's going to be pretty big by then.
{30421}{30506}She'll need someone|to help her tie her shoes.
{30512}{30592}Drive her to the hospital|if she goes into labor.
{30598}{30635}You don't have a car.
{30641}{30724}And your license expired.
{30730}{30843}There's so much to do,|and I have so little time!
{30946}{30973}Check this out.
{30979}{31062}There's a place you can go|to rent videos of all the museums.
{31068}{31138}"It's almost as good as being there."
{31144}{31250}It's better! You can't go to a museum|in your underwear.
{31256}{31349}You could, but just the one time.
{31362}{31413}We could get videos|of the sights...
{31419}{31513}...get a VCR in our hotel room|and never have to go outside!
{31519}{31604}If we do that,|we've got to rent "Die Hard".
{31611}{31721}I bet the British version is good!
{169}{234}That was the 10th time|I've peed here.
{240}{308}It's also the 10th time|you've told us.
{314}{364}Sorry, it must be hard to hear.
{370}{526}It's easier having babies playing|"Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!
{541}{596}I am so sick of being pregnant!
{602}{659}My only happiness|is from a cup of coffee...
{665}{766}...which is decaf|because I'm pregnant!
{781}{869}You want a cookie?
{880}{965}Thank you so much!
{971}{1084}So, honey, how are those|mood swings coming?
{1090}{1166}I haven't had any yet.
{1181}{1259}The One with the|Worst Best Man Ever
{2428}{2464}Here's the ring.
{2470}{2573}Yes, yes!|A thousand times, yes!
{2579}{2673}Any ideas for the bachelor party?
{2678}{2734}Before rings and bachelor parties...
{2740}{2811}...you have to decide|who your best man will be.
{2817}{2892}Oh, it's awkward.
{2920}{2977}I already asked Chandler.
{2983}{3040}He got to do it|at your first wedding.
{3046}{3123}I figured you'd understand.|I've known him longer.
{3129}{3224}I don't have any brothers.|I'll never be a best man.
{3230}{3295}You can be the best man|when I get married.
{3301}{3395}I'll never get to be a best man!
{3401}{3426}Wait, wait.
{3432}{3549}So you'll be my best man twice,|and I won't be yours at all?
{3555}{3675}Of course, you can be my best man.
{3738}{3781}What about me?|You said I could.
{3787}{3824}I'm not getting married!
{3830}{3905}It's a question|for science-fiction writers.
{3911}{3953}I can't believe it's not me.
{3959}{3988}How could it not be me?
{3994}{4025}I'm not even...
{4031}{4077}You know what?|That's it.
{4083}{4185}From now on,|Joey will be my best man.
{4190}{4288}Shame about you, though.
{4356}{4404}- Stop it.|- What?
{4410}{4459}One of the babies is kicking.
{4465}{4490}That's a good thing.
{4496}{4600}It's not kicking me.|It's kicking another baby.
{4606}{4714}Don't make me come in there!
{4731}{4780}Do you have a big bowl|I can borrow?
{4786}{4850}There's one under the cabinet.
{4856}{4879}Why do you need it?
{4885}{4949}We're having a party tomorrow night.
{4955}{5000}Are you planning on inviting us?
{5006}{5064}No. Later!
{5070}{5165}Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!
{5219}{5271}Hormones.
{5277}{5360}How come you're having a party|and we're not invited?
{5366}{5438}It's Ross' bachelor party.
{5444}{5507}Are you bachelors?
{5525}{5602}Are you strippers?
{5624}{5665}Then you're not invited.
{5671}{5752}Then you're not invited|to our party either.
{5758}{5833}What party?
{5895}{5931}Phoebe's baby shower.
{5937}{6096}Baby shower? That so doesn't sound|like something I want to do.
{6109}{6185}I can't believe|I'm going to have a party.
{6191}{6288}That's so great.|A party!
{6454}{6514}I don't know why.
{6520}{6599}This is what I got going|for the party liquor-wise.
{6605}{6665}- Get a lot of liquor.|- Great.
{6671}{6765}In terms of the invite list,|I got you, me and Chandler.
{6771}{6850}I'll invite Gunther because|we're talking pretty loud.
{6856}{6910}I'll be there.
{6916}{6962}I know it's your party...
{6968}{7048}...but I'd like to limit|the number of museum geeks.
{7054}{7212}Let's not invite any anthropologists.|Just the dinosaur dudes.
{7245}{7350}We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
{7356}{7398}Hey, what are you doing?
{7404}{7501}Just planning my bachelor party|with my best man.
{7507}{7563}Good luck trying|to top the last one.
{7569}{7658}It won't be that difficult|since this one won't be...
{7664}{7734}...in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
{7740}{7855}I'm Ross, I'm Ross.|I'm too good for the Hut.
{7861}{7951}I gotta go pick up Ben.|Everything sounds great.
{7957}{8034}Keep it on the mellow side.|A few guys hanging out.
{8040}{8083}No strippers or anything.
{8089}{8108}You got it.
{8114}{8188}See you later.
{8196}{8280}Have fun planning your mellow party.
{8286}{8435}There will be strippers. He didn't|say anything about no strippers.
{8441}{8479}He just said, "No strippers."
{8485}{8559}I chose not to hear that.
{8579}{8669}Look what I got, look what I got!
{8762}{8818}They make these for little people!
{8824}{8902}Little Village People.
{8956}{9048}Look at this one.|This is my favorite.
{9054}{9105}That is so sweet.
{9111}{9196}Phoebe will love dressing them.
{9215}{9353}Except she won't be the one|who gets to dress them.
{9358}{9415}She won't get to keep the babies.
{9421}{9558}My God, we are throwing|the most depressing baby shower!
{9566}{9666}Unless we give her all gifts|she can use after her pregnancy.
{9672}{9726}Like regular coffee.|Tequila!
{9732}{9803}And those leather pants|she's always wanted!
{9809}{9845}She'll love that!
{9851}{9925}What the hell is this?
{9928}{9980}You thought it'd make me feel better?
{9986}{10069}To give me something|I can't use for two months?
{10075}{10148}This sucks!
{10176}{10213}What's my next present?
{10219}{10308}We don't have anything.
{10311}{10378}Listen, about the stripper...
{10384}{10442}Good call!
{10469}{10530}A little announcement.
{10536}{10673}I've decided that my best man|is my best friend Gunther.
{10694}{10770}What's my last name?
{10776}{10849}Central Perk?
{10864}{10920}Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
{10926}{11007}Hey, Gunther!|Don't forget your shirt.
{11013}{11050}What are those?
{11056}{11157}Little party favors.|Check it out.
{11305}{11456}Just want everybody to know the|position of my best man is still open.
{11459}{11535}So is the position of the bride.
{11541}{11580}Great.
{11586}{11608}Smooth, man.
{11614}{11711}You got some chili on your neck.
{11750}{11840}I just want to say thanks, everyone.|This was great!
{11846}{11936}See you guys Monday morning.
{11966}{12081}- Thanks, Joey.|- Don't forget your shirt.
{12135}{12204}Hey, museum geeks!|Party's over.
{12210}{12288}Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.|There you go.
{12294}{12412}Back to your parents' basement.|All right.
{12440}{12538}Boys, come on out.|Here you go.
{12544}{12622}Look at the birdies!|Are those yours?
{12628}{12713}They let you keep|chickens and ducks as pets?
{12719}{12789}And I got the duck|totally trained too.
{12795}{12859}Stare at the wall.
{12865}{12934}Hardly move.
{12940}{13022}Be white.
{13034}{13089}You are good at that.
{13095}{13133}I had fun tonight.
{13139}{13180}You throw one hell of a party.
{13186}{13228}It was great meeting you.
{13234}{13349}If any of my friends ever get married|or have a birthday or a Tuesday...
{13355}{13427}Yeah, that'd be great.
{13433}{13496}So, I guess, good night.
{13502}{13622}Unless you want to hang around.
{13650}{13746}I'll let you play with my duck.
{14078}{14158}Stripper!
{14399}{14464}The stripper stole the ring!
{14470}{14559}Chandler, get up!|The stripper stole the ring!
{14565}{14645}- What?|- The ring is gone!
{14651}{14767}Just give me a minute|to wake up for this.
{14797}{14885}You lost the ring.|You're the worst best man!
{14891}{14993}This isn't funny.|I go to sleep, everything's cool.
{14999}{15072}I wake up, the stripper's gone,|and the ring is gone!
{15078}{15160}- You slept with her?|- Of course!
{15314}{15469}I wanted to apologize if I seemed|a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.
{15479}{15505}Just the hormones.
{15511}{15566}- No, we...|- Hormones.
{15572}{15682}I wanted to say thank you.|It was so sweet.
{15796}{15850}You seem to be doing much better.
{15856}{15908}- How are things going?|- Good.
{15914}{16034}Everything's been about me lately.|So what's happening with you?
{16040}{16157}We were just talking about me|not going to Ross' wedding.
{16163}{16268}It just might be too hard,|given the history and all that.
{16274}{16369}This reminds me of the time|when I lived on the street.
{16375}{16488}This guy offered to buy me food|if I slept with him.
{16521}{16570}How is this like that?
{16576}{16670}Well, let's see.|It's not really like that.
{16676}{16735}Because that was an actual problem.
{16741}{16824}And yours is just a bunch|of high-school crap...
{16830}{16931}...that nobody really gives!
{17021}{17069}I'm sorry. I just thought...
{17075}{17171}Here come the water works.
{17186}{17273}I called the company that sent her,|and they don't care.
{17279}{17414}I called 911 and they yelled at me,|This is an emergency!
{17513}{17623}Thanks again for the party.|The guys from work had a blast.
{17629}{17723}One of them had never been|to a bachelor party before.
{17729}{17840}Another one had never been|to a party before.
{17846}{17940}So that wedding ring.
{17942}{18006}Man, that is nice.
{18012}{18088}I might pick one of those|babies up for myself.
{18094}{18158}Where might one get one of those?
{18164}{18250}When my grandmother first came|to this country...
{18256}{18409}...that ring and the clothes on her back|were all she had with her.
{18424}{18561}So you might say|that the ring is irreplaceable.
{18567}{18620}It's been in my family|for generations.
{18626}{18716}Every bride who's worn it|has lived a long and happy life.
{18722}{18833}So you might say it's a magic ring.
{18914}{19016}Yeah, the stripper stole it.
{19018}{19070}My ring?|My wedding ring?
{19076}{19160}The stripper stole my wedding ring?
{19166}{19217}How could this happen?
{19223}{19359}It all started when you said,|"Joey, you be my best man!"
{19380}{19445}All right.|I'm going to call the cops.
{19451}{19530}I screwed up.|But you don't have to turn me in.
{19536}{19589}Not on you, on the stripper.
{19595}{19630}I already did that.
{19636}{19732}They said they'd look into it|after they solve all the murders.
{19738}{19822}- We'll call the company that sent her.|- I did that too.
{19828}{19925}They said if I bother them again,|they'd call the police.
{19931}{20029}I said, "You talk to the police,|you tell them I'm missing a ring."
{20035}{20097}So there's nothing we can do?
{20103}{20147}How could this happen?
{20153}{20280}Look, Ross, I am so sorry.
{20335}{20394}What if we just called her...
{20400}{20472}...used a fake name|and had her come to my office?
{20478}{20598}That sounds like fun,|but we got a ring to find!
{20721}{20808}Here's your tea, Phoebe.
{20940}{20982}It's so good.
{20988}{21019}Thanks.
{21025}{21113}- Good.|- So glad you like it.
{21119}{21138}What?
{21144}{21209}She made the tea.
{21215}{21285}I think I just had a contraction.
{21291}{21312}- What?|- My God!
{21318}{21373}I felt one a few minutes ago.
{21379}{21422}That definitely was one.
{21428}{21474}You can't have the baby here.
{21480}{21579}I haven't sterilized the apartment|since the guys moved out!
{21585}{21720}It's okay. I'll boil some water|and rip up some sheets.
{21720}{21757}It's probably false labor.
{21763}{21844}That can happen near the end.|Just get the book.
{21850}{21928}Get the book!
{21966}{22073}- The Bible?|- I don't know!
{22156}{22200}All right.|This is great.
{22206}{22245}You get behind the desk.
{22251}{22329}When she comes in,|she won't recognize you because...
{22335}{22393}Well, why would she?
{22399}{22448}And then you buzz Ross and I.
{22454}{22578}You be Mr. Gonzales,|and I'll be Mr. Wong.
{22584}{22656}Diverse.
{22659}{22742}Anybody call for security?
{22748}{22838}You be cool.
{22956}{23048}Which one is Gunther Central Perk?
{23087}{23204}Where's my ring?|My dead grandmother's wedding ring.
{23221}{23285}Way to be cool, man.
{23291}{23328}What?
{23334}{23436}There was a ring in a box.|After you left, it was gone.
{23442}{23528}You think I stole some ring?
{23559}{23633}Just save yourself the time|and confess.
{23639}{23717}Who are you, the Hardy Boys?
{23779}{23885}I don't need to steal a stupid ring.|I make $1,600 a week.
{23891}{23959}Any of you guys make that?
{23965}{24041}Marry me.
{24099}{24174}It was in my room all night.|She didn't take it.
{24180}{24291}I didn't take it.|You didn't take it. Then who did?
{24316}{24402}We're trying to think.
{24691}{24760}I don't get how you know|it's false labor.
{24766}{24837}Do you see any babies?
{24852}{24874}How do you feel?
{24880}{24944}Okay, I guess.
{24950}{24990}I don't know.
{24996}{25073}I know it's going|to be over soon so...
{25079}{25140}But isn't that a good thing?
{25146}{25233}- You said you were sick of this.|- I know.
{25239}{25305}Usually, when you're done|with the pregnant thing...
{25311}{25402}...you get to do the mom thing.
{25414}{25566}But I'll be sitting around in my|leather pants, drinking tequila.
{25579}{25650}Some moms do that.
{25656}{25723}That's even sadder.
{25723}{25824}Look, I know what I got myself into.
{25830}{25939}It's just that|now that they're in me...
{25945}{26043}...it's like I know them and...
{26049}{26152}It just won't be easy|when these babies have to go away.
{26158}{26205}I know, sweetie.
{26211}{26269}But it's not like|you won't have anything.
{26275}{26385}You'll have nieces and nephews.|That's even better.
{26391}{26442}No, really.
{26448}{26548}You won't be the one|worrying about saving for college.
{26554}{26610}Or yelling at them when they're bad.
{26616}{26745}Or putting them on Ritalin|when they just won't calm down.
{26760}{26878}You'll be the one they run away to.|The one they talk to about sex.
{26884}{26972}You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.
{26994}{27054}Cool Aunt Phoebe.
{27060}{27121}I am pretty cool.
{27130}{27253}And you know what else?|Are they going to love you!
{27259}{27335}They are going to love me.
{27341}{27400}Thanks, you guys. Again.
{27406}{27491}Oh, sweetie.
{27536}{27558}What?
{27564}{27626}Just kidding.
{27634}{27656}Oh, my God!
{27662}{27742}Got you again.|You're so easy!
{27806}{27843}If anything happens to him...
{27849}{27919}The vet said|it's a simple procedure.
{27925}{27998}Things can go wrong.|What if he doesn't make it?
{28004}{28024}He will, Joe.
{28030}{28090}But what if he doesn't?
{28096}{28191}He's such a good duck.
{29081}{29145}I'm so worried about him!
{29151}{29200}Somebody lose a ring?
{29206}{29326}Oh, my God!|Thank you! Thank you so much!
{29374}{29409}How's the duck?
{29415}{29479}Just fine.|You'll see him in a bit.
{29485}{29509}Great.
{29515}{29557}Thanks for being so cool.
{29563}{29593}No, that's all right.
{29599}{29709}You made me your best man|and I totally let you down.
{29715}{29765}- It's not your fault.|- Yeah, it is.
{29771}{29813}You wouldn't have lost it.
{29819}{29923}Ross, you were right.|He should be your best man.
{29929}{30000}- No, you should.|- Don't argue.
{30006}{30086}I get to choose my best man.
{30091}{30171}I want both you guys.
{30173}{30227}Really?
{30233}{30305}Both you guys should be|up there with me.
{30311}{30382}You two are my...
{30395}{30501}I'm lucky to have just one good...
{30509}{30590}Thanks, man.
{30596}{30702}I got to go check something, okay?
{30775}{30874}- What a baby!|- Total wuss.
{58}{114}Hurry up!|The flight leaves in four hours!
{120}{183}There could be traffic!|The plane could leave early!
{189}{298}In London, there could be|a line at customs! Come on!
{304}{420}Six-hour trip to London.|That's a lot of Monica.
{426}{538}Passport, check. Camera, check.|Traveler's checks, check.
{544}{600}- Who are you saying "check" to?|- Myself.
{606}{640}For remembering to pack a thing.
{646}{746}You do a good thing,|you get a "check".
{765}{817}Mom does it.|I never realized it was weird.
{823}{898}My mom used to put her head|in the oven.
{905}{1025}Actually, only the one time.|But it's pretty weird.
{1096}{1116}Are you ready yet?
{1122}{1218}- Got the tickets?|- Right here. Check!
{1235}{1277}It's all London, baby!
{1283}{1346}Here we go.
{1379}{1420}Got your passport?
{1426}{1539}Third drawer of my dresser.|You don't want to lose that!
{1620}{1668}There it is!
{1674}{1760}The One With Ross' Wedding
{2777}{2850}The vacuum's in my closet|on the left side.
{2856}{2910}Garbage bags are next|to the refrigerator.
{2917}{2980}Rachel's gonna be here.|Can't I just ask her?
{2985}{3076}Yeah, okay. Give that a try!
{3080}{3127}- Let's do it.|- Cheerio!
{3133}{3174}London, baby!
{3180}{3222}That's not gonna get annoying.
{3228}{3291}London, baby!
{3292}{3349}You know what?|I was wrong.
{3355}{3412}We're all here.|Let's get going!
{3418}{3467}I want to go over and hug you...
{3473}{3542}...and wish you luck,|but I can't get up.
{3548}{3663}- I'll come hug you.|- Great, can you bring me the paper?
{3678}{3729}- Have a great wedding.|- Thanks.
{3735}{3782}Chandler, I want to hug you too!
{3788}{3904}You might as well bring my book|from your apartment.
{4005}{4115}- So we're off.|- Have fun!
{4125}{4182}- I can't believe you won't be there.|- I know.
{4188}{4248}Come. Why don't you come?
{4254}{4339}To London. Please?|It would mean so much to me.
{4345}{4397}I gotta work. I'm sorry.
{4403}{4445}Why can't you take|a couple of days off?
{4451}{4520}Because I can't.|I told you.
{4526}{4578}This is my wedding.
{4584}{4680}Now we are late.|Let's go, let's go!
{4713}{4806}Fine, you'll watch it|on video when we get back.
{4812}{4932}Here you go, Phoebe!|Phoe-bo! Phoo-ba-la!
{4982}{5034}You!
{5040}{5072}Let's go!
{5078}{5149}Bye, Pheebs!
{5231}{5318}London, baby!
{5341}{5382}Oh, God!
{5388}{5445}Do you need a hug?
{5451}{5539}You don't have to bring me anything.
{5886}{5969}Chandler, do something!
{5971}{6070}- Do something!|- I am. I'm ignoring you.
{6076}{6117}I'll be the on-camera guy.
{6123}{6184}All right. First stop...
{6190}{6263}...Westminster Abbey.
{6269}{6294}What is that?
{6300}{6347}That's London, baby!
{6353}{6399}All right, the hotel's here.
{6405}{6431}Wait.
{6437}{6504}We want to go...
{6566}{6605}I know.
{6611}{6696}I'm gonna have to go into the map.
{6791}{6868}If you see a little version|of me in there, kill it!
{6874}{6932}I got it.
{6940}{7007}Here we go!
{7012}{7152}We're not gonna have to walk this way|the entire time, are we?
{7155}{7238}Man, you made me lose it!
{7343}{7382}That was all before 10:00.
{7388}{7467}The caterer rang. It'll be Chicken|Kiev, not Tarragon.
{7473}{7529}Then the florist said|there are no tulips.
{7536}{7601}And the cellist has|carpal tunnel syndrome...
{7607}{7647}Emily, honey. Okay?
{7653}{7715}Well, up yours too!
{7721}{7788}- No! That's "time out".|- Sorry.
{7794}{7889}Sweetie, relax.|Everything will be great, okay?
{7895}{7974}Come on, come on.
{8005}{8051}Chicken Kiev?
{8057}{8134}Doesn't that sound delicious|at the last minute?
{8140}{8229}Salmon would be|more elegant than chicken.
{8235}{8341}And you wouldn't worry|about the salmonella.
{8367}{8414}I can't wait to see|where you're getting married.
{8420}{8504}It's beautiful.|Her parents got married here.
{8510}{8556}I can't believe|they're tearing it down.
{8562}{8699}It's really the most lovely building.|It's over...
{8736}{8793}Oh, my God!
{8799}{8876}It's nice.
{9066}{9119}Oh, my God!
{9125}{9171}What are we going to do?
{9177}{9227}Everything's gonna be all right.
{9233}{9264}How's it gonna be all right?
{9270}{9342}I see that.
{9343}{9412}I talked to a guy,|and I found out what happened.
{9418}{9489}They tore it down early.
{9549}{9591}All right!
{9597}{9649}Westminster Abbey.
{9655}{9752}Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.
{9808}{9877}What do you think of the Abbey?
{9883}{9962}It's great! They're thinking|of changing the name.
{9968}{10064}- To what?|- To "Put the Camera Away"!
{10070}{10170}Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
{10321}{10406}- Don't get up. What do you need?|- Nothing.
{10412}{10482}Come on. I'm here|to take care of you.
{10488}{10571}Okay, I have a wedgie.
{10600}{10671}That is all you.
{10713}{10747}What do you want for lunch?
{10753}{10806}I don't know.
{10812}{10856}I guess we have to eat.
{10862}{10916}Yeah, I do.
{10922}{10959}What's the matter?
{10965}{11027}I'm bummed the way|I left things with Ross.
{11033}{11130}I wish I didn't lie about work.|He seemed so mad at me.
{11136}{11225}Don't be so hard on yourself.|If I was still in love with some...
{11231}{11297}Still in love with?
{11303}{11374}I'm not in love with Ross.
{11451}{11479}Good!
{11485}{11537}Yeah, me neither.
{11543}{11613}I'm not at the wedding,|because he's my ex-boyfriend...
{11619}{11694}...and that would be uncomfortable.
{11701}{11798}Not because I'm in love with him.|I like Ross as much as anyone.
{11804}{11891}Clearly, I have feelings for him,|but they don't mean love.
{11897}{12038}I mean, do I still have|loving feelings for Ross? Yeah!
{12045}{12089}I have continuing feelings of love.
{12095}{12163}But that doesn't mean|I'm still in love with him.
{12170}{12312}I have sexual feelings for him,|but I do love him.
{12322}{12376}Oh, my God!
{12382}{12462}Why didn't you tell me?
{12468}{12529}- We thought you knew!|- We?
{12535}{12621}We all know.|We talk about it all the time.
{12639}{12689}You all know?|Does Ross know?
{12695}{12764}No! Ross doesn't know anything.
{12770}{12815}And you didn't tell me!
{12821}{12900}We thought you knew.|It's so obvious!
{12906}{12951}It would be like telling Monica:
{12957}{13056}"Hey, you like things clean. "
{13146}{13261}What are you in the market for?|Scarves, souvenir post cards...
{13267}{13350}Check this out!
{13363}{13420}That's the stuff!|What do you think?
{13426}{13529}I won't need that|"I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
{13535}{13588}Well, I like it. Here you go.
{13594}{13682}You're not really buying that.|Haven't you embarrassed me enough?
{13688}{13718}Oh, I embarrass you?
{13724}{13814}How can I answer when|I'm pretending I don't know you?
{13820}{13889}He's just jealous.|All Londoners wear them.
{13895}{13993}Really? Then how come no one here|anywhere is wearing one?
{13999}{14069}They're all tourists.
{14075}{14148}If you insist on wearing that|in public...
{14154}{14270}...you're gonna spend the afternoon|all by yourself.
{14381}{14463}If you make me choose between|you and the hat, I choose the hat.
{14469}{14518}- Good choice.|- Thanks.
{14524}{14642}That's it! I'm out of here.|I won't be embarrassed anymore.
{14899}{14953}I spoke to your dad,|and you know what?
{14959}{15010}He thinks we can find a new hall.
{15015}{15075}- We don't have to.|- You found a place?
{15081}{15161}No, but Monica and I were talking...
{15167}{15241}...and I was so upset about the hall|being knocked down...
{15248}{15357}...she suggested we put|the wedding off for a bit.
{15407}{15429}She said what?
{15435}{15511}If I won't be happy with somewhere|we'd find in a day...
{15517}{15599}...we should postpone it.
{15634}{15703}Postpone it.
{15708}{15809}Do you think Monica realizes|how much our parents spent on this?
{15815}{15919}Do you think my sister's teeny,|tiny, little brain comprehends...
{15925}{15980}...that people took time|out of their lives...
{15986}{16097}...to fly thousands of miles|to be here?
{16160}{16209}This isn't right.
{16215}{16297}I realize that|people are gonna be disappointed.
{16303}{16354}But I'm sure they'll come back.
{16360}{16443}I can't ask people to do that.|Would you?
{16449}{16524}Don't you point your pants at me!
{16536}{16564}We have no choice.
{16570}{16644}Anywhere half-decent|will have been booked.
{16650}{16709}Don't you understand?|This is our wedding!
{16715}{16827}Postponing it is not an option.|This is when we're getting married.
{16833}{16904}- You're saying it's now or never?|- I'm saying it's now.
{16910}{16966}- Or?|- There's no "or" in mine!
{16972}{17055}What is wrong with these pants?
{17077}{17140}It's not the pants.|It's you who's backwards.
{17146}{17221}If you don't understand|how important this is to me...
{17227}{17282}...perhaps we shouldn't marry at all!
{17288}{17379}Emily, no! Wait, stop!|Emily, please...
{17599}{17649}Did shopping help you|feel any better?
{17655}{17735}Manhattan doesn't have enough stores.
{17779}{17814}I can help you get over him.
{17820}{17849}You can?
{17855}{17913}I need you to bring me|photos of Ross...
{17919}{17982}...and a small piece of chocolate...
{17988}{18034}...and a glass of tepid water.
{18040}{18088}Is this where you throw stuff...
{18094}{18198}...in a bag with graveyard dirt|and hang it from a north-facing tree?
{18204}{18301}Only if you have the hiccups too.
{18335}{18448}The chocolate and water are for me.|I didn't feel like getting up.
{18467}{18524}I'll show you a picture of Ross.
{18530}{18620}And you remember all|the bad things about him.
{18626}{18678}- Focus on his flaws.|- I can do that.
{18684}{18766}I did that|while we were going out.
{18772}{18853}Before we start, I want to say,|for the record, I love Ross.
{18859}{18941}He's such a great guy.
{19044}{19090}Close your eyes.
{19096}{19155}Imagine that you're with Ross.
{19161}{19221}Imagine that you're kissing him.
{19227}{19301}You're running your hands|all over his body.
{19307}{19368}You run your hands|through his hair but...
{19374}{19493}Gross!|It's some kind of grease.
{19553}{19592}I don't know.
{19598}{19662}His hair never bothered me that much.
{19668}{19772}It was more crunchy|than it was greasy.
{19802}{19853}This will be harder than I thought.
{19859}{19950}Let's try some aversion therapy.
{19952}{20034}Look at the picture.
{20199}{20238}How do you feel now?
{20244}{20328}Well, I like you less.
{20786}{20826}Sorry.
{20832}{20916}I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said|you were embarrassing me.
{20922}{20952}That wasn't cool.
{20959}{21081}If it makes you feel any better,|I've had a really lousy day.
{21087}{21127}Me too.
{21133}{21200}- Yeah?|- No!
{21203}{21276}I had the best day ever!
{21281}{21367}Dude, check this out!
{21447}{21501}{Y:i}Tell my friend you like my hat.
{21507}{21576}{Y:i}- What's your friend's name?|- Chandler.
{21582}{21606}{Y:i}Hi, Chandler.
{21612}{21653}That's...
{21659}{21752}That's Fergie, baby!
{21753}{21873}{Y:i}Joey says you don't like his hat,|but I think it's kind of dashing.
{21879}{21910}When did you...?|How?
{21916}{21963}I was trying to get|to Buckingham Palace.
{21969}{22054}So I'm in my map and...
{22108}{22176}I understand you had|a talk with Emily.
{22182}{22219}Yes, I did.
{22225}{22313}And you are welcome.
{22319}{22382}Am I?
{22392}{22487}Was it your idea|to postpone the wedding?
{22526}{22600}- I'm going to the bathroom.|- Wait up!
{22650}{22725}Since you're the fix-it lady,|here's a pickle:
{22730}{22844}What do you do when the bride says|she doesn't want the wedding at all?
{22850}{22886}She said that?
{22892}{22911}Why?
{22917}{23011}I don't know. I said it was stupid|to put off the wedding...
{23017}{23079}...and she, like, flipped out.
{23085}{23188}Oh, my God!|You're even dumber than I am.
{23194}{23236}Excuse me?
{23242}{23313}How long have you been planning|this wedding?
{23319}{23347}I don't know. A month?
{23353}{23430}Emily's probably been planning it|since she was 5.
{23436}{23561}Ever since the first time she hung|a pillowcase from her head.
{23568}{23612}That's what we did.
{23618}{23692}We dreamed about the perfect wedding.
{23698}{23765}In the perfect place.
{23771}{23873}With the perfect|four-tiered wedding cake.
{23874}{23948}With the little people on top.
{24139}{24204}But the most important part...
{24210}{24268}...is that we had the perfect guy...
{24274}{24410}...who understood just how important|all that stuff was.
{24419}{24484}I had no idea.
{24490}{24631}That pillowcase thing, I thought|you were doing "The Flying Nun".
{24640}{24732}Sometimes we were.
{24746}{24778}Come on.
{24784}{24868}Help me figure out what to do.
{24992}{25068}Pretty intense, huh?
{25074}{25216}I hope Ross didn't think we left|because we were uncomfortable here.
{25336}{25405}I hope he did.
{25577}{25611}Pheebs, it's Joey.
{25617}{25667}Hey, Joey!
{25673}{25742}I saw someone that looks just|like you on the subway.
{25748}{25888}I was going to say hi, then I figured|he doesn't care he looks like you.
{25894}{25961}That just cost me 4 bucks.
{25967}{26050}I called to see how the chick|and the duck are doing.
{26056}{26176}They're having fun with Aunt Phoebe.|Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful.
{26187}{26218}So do you miss me?
{26224}{26291}Kind of, but I've been|having too much fun.
{26297}{26339}You're not homesick yet?
{26345}{26418}I don't think so.
{26424}{26516}Well, the seven of us miss you.
{26568}{26620}- Who's seven?|- Me, Rachel...
{26626}{26659}...the birds, the babies.
{26665}{26755}The babies miss me?
{26760}{26784}Pizza guy's here!
{26790}{26863}You ordered pizza without me?
{26869}{26953}But we were thinking about you.|We ordered the Joey Special.
{26959}{27036}Two pizzas?
{27048}{27102}{Y:i}- Gotta go! Talk to you later.|- Wait!
{27108}{27192}Where did you get it from?
{27438}{27531}{Y:i}And they're always glad you came
{27537}{27595}{Y:i}You want to be where you can see
{27601}{27655}{Y:i}Your troubles are all the same
{27660}{27799}{Y:i}You want to be|Where everybody knows your name
{27873}{27927}Why have you brought me here?
{27933}{27967}You'll see.
{27973}{28050}This wedding won't happen.
{28089}{28133}Ross.
{28139}{28197}But imagine a lot more lights...
{28204}{28266}...and fewer bricks...
{28272}{28331}...and flowers and candles.
{28337}{28401}And the musicians can go over here.
{28407}{28471}The chairs can face this way and...
{28477}{28525}You go.
{28531}{28626}But if you don't love this,|we'll do it any other place or time.
{28632}{28672}Really, it's fine.
{28678}{28754}Whatever you want.
{28755}{28800}It's perfect.
{28806}{28858}And, I don't know, if it rains...
{28864}{28938}Then we'll get wet.
{29051}{29125}I don't even have a date.
{29194}{29239}Do you remember|where the duck food is?
{29245}{29314}In the guys' apartment,|under the sink. Why?
{29320}{29365}Because I'm going to London.
{29371}{29416}What? What do you mean?
{29422}{29474}I have to tell Ross I love him.
{29480}{29551}Take care and don't have|the babies till I get back.
{29557}{29634}You can't go.|Ross loves Emily.
{29640}{29706}I know, but I have|to tell him how I feel.
{29712}{29820}He deserves all the information|to make an informed decision.
{29825}{29895}You're going|because you hope he'll say:
{29902}{30009}"I love you too.|Forget the British chippy. "
{30031}{30055}You think he will?
{30061}{30188}No, because he's in love|with the British chippy!
{30189}{30278}You're just gonna mess with his head|and ruin his wedding.
{30284}{30364}It's too late!|You missed your chance.
{30370}{30459}I'm sorry.|This must be hard.
{30463}{30545}But it's over.
{30590}{30685}No, it's not over|until someone says, "I do. "
{30691}{30768}I do! I do!
{30900}{31017}Like I can really chase you.|I'm carrying a litter!
{31150}{31190}The Waltham residence.
{31196}{31240}Is this Emily's parents' house?
{31246}{31286}{Y:i}This is the housekeeper.
{31292}{31426}And, by the way, that is not how one|addresses a person on the telephone.
{31432}{31477}{Y:i}First one identifies oneself...
{31483}{31600}...and then asks for the person|with whom one wishes to speak.
{31606}{31681}This is Phoebe Buffay.|I was wondering, please...
{31687}{31751}...if it's not|too much trouble, please.
{31757}{31843}Might I speak with|Miss Emily Waltham, please?
{31849}{31916}Miss Waltham is|at the rehearsal dinner.
{31922}{32015}And it is not polite|to make fun of people. Goodbye.
{32021}{32113}I'll be nice, I swear.|Could you just give me their number?
{32119}{32217}I'm afraid I'm not at liberty|to divulge that information.
{32223}{32321}Somebody is on their way to ruin|the wedding, and I have to warn them.
{32327}{32398}So give me that number|or I'll come over there...
{32404}{32547}...and I'll kick your snooty ass|all the way to New Gloukenshire!
{32582}{32661}She knew I could kick her ass.
{32798}{32836}Hi, sweetheart.
{32842}{32874}Mom, Dad.
{32880}{32911}Sorry, we're late.
{32917}{32968}My fault.|I insisted on riding the tube.
{32974}{33033}Judy, the kids!
{33039}{33139}That's what they call the subway.
{33140}{33159}I thought...
{33165}{33229}Dad, we got it.
{33235}{33280}Here comes my dad and stepmom.
{33286}{33314}Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
{33320}{33364}This is Steven...
{33370}{33404}...and Andrea Waltham.
{33410}{33459}Very nice to meet you.
{33465}{33506}Darling, the Gellers.
{33512}{33551}Darling, it's the Gellers.
{33557}{33680}She's self-involved.|I should never have married her.
{33694}{33731}- It's the Gellers.|- Where?
{33737}{33820}That's one and that's another one.
{33823}{33848}Lovely to meet you.
{33854}{33909}Nice of you to pay|for half the wedding.
{33915}{33974}The hell with tradition!|We're happy to do it.
{33980}{34046}We know how expensive|weddings can be.
{34052}{34146}Besides, this may be|the only wedding we get to throw.
{34152}{34255}A joke that's funny in all countries.
{34349}{34468}- What's in it?|- Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.
{34528}{34593}That's not food.
{34648}{34757}Everything's different here.|I want to go home.
{34761}{34806}I miss my family, the coffeehouse.
{34812}{34897}I can't remember|what Phoebe looks like!
{34903}{34969}It's been three days.
{34985}{35024}You're just homesick.
{35030}{35118}Would you just try to relax|and just enjoy yourself?
{35124}{35198}You're different here too.
{35204}{35281}You're mean in England!
{35287}{35318}What the hell?
{35324}{35346}What's up, Dad?
{35352}{35416}This bill for my half.|It's insane.
{35422}{35484}Why is it so much?|The reception's at their house.
{35490}{35584}Flowers, liquor.|Re-carpet first floor?
{35590}{35654}New guest bath, landscaping.
{35660}{35713}I'm paying to remodel this house.
{35719}{35799}I'll give that son of a bitch|a piece of my mind.
{35805}{35826}Please.
{35832}{35894}I don't want anything|to upset Emily.
{35900}{35967}She's had a hard enough|couple of days as it is.
{35973}{36028}Here.|Let me go talk to him.
{36034}{36151}You tell him no one takes advantage|of the Gellers.
{36184}{36305}Sometimes I forget|how powerful you can be.
{36367}{36437}And I'll go get drunk.
{36645}{36676}Your next flight to London?
{36682}{36738}There's one leaving in 30 minutes.
{36744}{36808}And I do have one seat left.
{36814}{36843}Thank you, thank you.
{36849}{36969}The last-minute fare|on this ticket is $2700.
{36975}{37039}I don't have enough left|on my credit card.
{37045}{37103}You can split it with another card.
{37109}{37192}How about five?
{37198}{37229}Thank you.
{37235}{37330}I need to see your passport.
{37360}{37503}I don't have it, but I can tell you|where it is on my nightstand.
{37519}{37625}You know what?|I have my driver's license.
{37627}{37715}And I have a 20.
{37790}{37874}My father is not going to pay|for the built-in barbecue.
{37880}{37990}And believe me, you can|kiss your gazebo goodbye.
{37995}{38066}I might be able|to get you the new lawn.
{38072}{38152}Then you have to give us|the lawn ornaments.
{38158}{38274}I go back there with lawn ornaments,|he'll laugh in my face.
{38285}{38330}It's ridiculous, I mean we had an|agreement!
{38346}{38439}Will you say something, Steven?
{38445}{38540}Don't take that tone with me.
{38544}{38630}All right, you can.
{38765}{38798}Thank God!
{38804}{38855}You changed your mind.
{38861}{38924}You probably don't want|to talk about it.
{38930}{39002}You're doing the right thing.
{39008}{39039}Where are you going?
{39045}{39097}What are you doing?
{39103}{39215}Why am I always pregnant|when she does that?
{39252}{39299}I'd like to toast Ross and Emily.
{39305}{39342}My big toast is tomorrow.
{39348}{39484}This is kind of my little toast|or Melba toast, if you will.
{39565}{39684}I knew Ross when he was going out|with his first girlfriend.
{39690}{39821}I thought things would work out|until he over-inflated her.
{39889}{39965}Oh, dear God!
{40013}{40058}Hello, Waltham Interiors.
{40064}{40098}Mrs. Waltham.
{40104}{40204}I need to speak with|one of the best men or Ross' sister.
{40210}{40308}- Who is this?|- Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.
{40314}{40383}If you're Ross' friend,|why aren't you here?
{40389}{40503}I can't fly.|I'm having my brother's babies.
{40590}{40677}Am I on the radio?
{40698}{40758}Can I talk to one of them?|It's important.
{40764}{40848}I'm bored of you now.|I'm going to cut you off.
{40880}{40940}Okay I have to kick her ass too.
{40979}{41098}We're excited that Ross and Emily are|getting married at Montgomery Hall.
{41104}{41194}To think, my friend getting|married in Monty Hall.
{41200}{41228}Come on, Monty Hall!
{41234}{41323}Let's Make a Deal.|Come on, you people!
{41329}{41430}All right, forget it.|Congratulations.
{41512}{41589}Best man number two, Joey Tribbiani.
{41595}{41700}I'm not good with the jokes|like Chandler here.
{41747}{41823}Congratulations to the happy couple.
{41829}{41950}I first met Ross|in this coffeehouse back home.
{42080}{42138}Home.
{42144}{42184}New York City.
{42190}{42282}Where everybody knows my name.
{42315}{42361}Anyway...
{42367}{42403}... I love you guys.
{42409}{42510}But not as much as I love America.
{42530}{42614}Can we please go home now?
{42620}{42659}Are you going home?
{42665}{42754}I was hoping to get|to know you better.
{42760}{42850}I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
{42947}{43006}I was laughing.
{43012}{43085}Out loud?
{43089}{43166}I didn't want everyone|to think I was stupid.
{43172}{43197}How are you?
{43203}{43289}My mom's driving me crazy.|But Ross is getting married!
{43295}{43374}I'm happy.|I won't let anything spoil that.
{43380}{43479}I just want to say that|Ross is a wonderful young man.
{43485}{43551}Thanks. We like him.
{43557}{43686}My God! You must have been|a teenager when you had him.
{44887}{44951}There's no way in hell|I'm paying for it.
{44957}{45016}Look, we're down to just one point.
{45022}{45099}Could we please just settle it|after the wedding?
{45105}{45184}Fine, but I'm not paying|for your wine cellar...
{45190}{45333}...you thieving, would-be-speaking-|German-if-it-weren't-for-us man!
{45416}{45546}The guy was hammered. There's|no way you look like Ross' mother.
{45548}{45606}- Then why would he say it?|- Because he's crazy!
{45612}{45751}Earlier, he thanked me for my very|moving performance in "Titanic".
{45788}{45861}My mother's right.|I'll never get married.
{45867}{45919}You know what, that is...
{45925}{45973}Who wouldn't want you?
{45979}{46094}Please! I'm a single mom|with a 30-year-old son.
{45065}{45114}Hi, I'm back. Listen, I need to...
{45117}{45136}Hello.
{45153}{45229}Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
{45230}{45305}Oh I'm afraid that plane has already|pulled away from the gate.
{45306}{45336}Okay, you know what. You're|going to have to call that plane
{45338}{45396}and tell them to swing around|and come and pick me up.
{45398}{45443}I can't do that.
{45448}{45485}Sure, you know what? Come|on, we'll just tell them
{45490}{45563}that there was like a problem|with like the "engine".
{45605}{45683}I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you|to step aside, Miss.
{45698}{45755}Look, If I don't get to London... he is|going to marry that other girl!
{45776}{45851}I can't imagine why.
{45858}{45970}All right, you know what? I am not leaving|here, until you call that plane back!
{46178}{46246}I'm getting married today!
{46262}{46281}Hi Ross.
{46287}{46389}I'm getting married today!
{46437}{46525}Do you think he knew I was here?
{46655}{46765}I've never done that with you before.
{46792}{46837}So how are you?
{46843}{46910}You okay?
{46924}{46985}You?
{47002}{47059}You?
{47065}{47140}We did you.
{47222}{47320}- I better get going.|- Absolutely.
{47355}{47397}Could you not look?
{47403}{47480}I don't want to look.
{47888}{47977}Excuse me, if you plan on|doing that the entire flight...
{47983}{48059}... tell me now, so that|I can take a sedative.
{48065}{48145}Or maybe slip you one.
{48299}{48349}It's just that I'm kind of excited.
{48355}{48496}I'm going to London|to tell this guy that I love him.
{48809}{48879}Where the hell have you been?
{48885}{48995}I spent the night out. I met|this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
{49001}{49035}I don't want to hear about her!
{49041}{49138}Pheebs, you know you're still|my number one girl.
{49144}{49233}We have an emergency.|Rachel's coming to London.
{49239}{49289}Great!
{49295}{49383}No, she's coming to tell Ross|that she loves him.
{49389}{49414}But he loves Emily.
{49420}{49474}I know that!
{49480}{49555}You have to stop her.|She's going to ruin the wedding.
{49560}{49590}Okay.
{49602}{49627}All right, so, okay...
{49633}{49903}Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming.|Do... something.
{49938}{49995}Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's
{49995}{50063}your responsibility now. The|burden is off me, right?
{50063}{50090}Right.
{50100}{50133}So tell me about this girl.
{50300}{50337}Have you seen Monica?
{50343}{50417}I'm not seeing Monica!
{50530}{50620}We got to find her. Rachel's coming|to tell Ross she loves him.
{50626}{50692}- Oh, my God!|- Do you know where she is?
{50698}{50843}What's with the third degree?|Why not just shine a light in my eyes?
{50871}{50941}Then I realized all this stuff|I had been doing...
{50947}{51044}...proposing to Joshua,|lying about why I couldn't come...
{51050}{51129}...was all just a way of...
{51135}{51176}I'm sorry. Can I interrupt?
{51182}{51330}I just want to say that you are|a horrible, horrible person.
{51348}{51371}Pardon me?
{51377}{51461}You're about to ruin|the happiest day of his life.
{51467}{51525}I have to agree|with your friend Pheebs.
{51531}{51606}This is a terrible, terrible plan.
{51612}{51692}- But he has to know how I feel.|- But why?
{51698}{51800}He loves this Emily.|No good can come of this.
{51806}{51843}I think you're wrong.
{51849}{51911}Oh, no!
{51957}{52075}By the way, it seems to be clear|you were on a break.
{52310}{52376}Oh, my God!
{52382}{52437}It's like a fairyland.
{52443}{52506}I know. It's horrible, isn't it?
{52512}{52592}I love it. I only hope|my wedding looks this good.
{52598}{52684}- I just...|- You can let some go by.
{52745}{52787}Start looking out for Rachel.
{52793}{52864}I'll cover the door.|You watch that big hole.
{52870}{52927}I've got Chandler covering Ross.
{52933}{52997}Why would I care where Chandler is?
{53003}{53070}You know...
{53072}{53161}...sometimes I don't even|like Chandler.
{53250}{53285}I do.
{53291}{53358}I do.
{53380}{53407}It's the second one.
{53413}{53480}Right?
{53542}{53563}Hello, Joey.
{53569}{53645}Hey, Felicity.
{53653}{53738}I thought about you all day.
{53741}{53801}Talk New York to me again.
{53807}{53875}Forget about it.
{53881}{53941}How you doing?
{54008}{54082}We're not paying|for your wine cellar.
{54088}{54136}You have to meet me in the middle.
{54142}{54247}My foot will meet|the middle of your ass.
{54256}{54331}- What's going on?|- Everything's under control.
{54337}{54448}You want a piece of me?|Is that what you're saying?
{54455}{54474}That's it!
{54480}{54534}Parents! Parents!|Back away!
{54540}{54590}This is our wedding day!
{54596}{54640}From now on, everyone gets along.
{54646}{54700}And if I hear one more word...
{54706}{54733}...no grandchildren!
{54739}{54794}That's right!
{54800}{54863}Sorry, old boy.
{54901}{54998}I could kill you|with my thumb, you know.
{55060}{55095}What was that about?
{55101}{55205}It was this disagreement over...
{55214}{55300}My God! You look beautiful.
{55323}{55399}You can't see me before the wedding.|It's bad luck.
{55405}{55523}I think we've had all the bad luck|we're going to have.
{56365}{56449}My God, Rachel!
{56475}{56573}You're here.|I can't believe it.
{56593}{56631}Why are you here?
{56637}{56718}I just came to...
{56782}{56873}I just needed to tell you...
{56901}{56988}...congratulations.
{57700}{57762}Hello, Waltham Interiors.
{57768}{57816}{Y:i}Mrs. Waltham? Hi it's Phoebe again.
{57830}{57860}Why?!
{57877}{57930}Yeah. Can I please please please talk
{57931}{57985}to one of the best men? This is|going to be the last time.
{58001}{58065}Joey, there's a girl on the phone for you.
{58096}{58142}Great!
{58166}{58195}Hello.
{58211}{58233}{Y:i}Joey it's Phoebe.
{58239}{58268}Did you stop Rachel?
{58269}{58336}No, but it's okay. She just came in and|gave him a hug. That's it.
{58342}{58380}Nothing got ruined?
{58381}{58406}No.
{58410}{58470}That's so great!
{58471}{58530}So what's going on now?
{58549}{58631}I'm walking down the aisle.
{58645}{58705}Still walking.
{58710}{58795}I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked|up with last night. Hey!
{58858}{58900}I just told her "Hey!".
{58923}{58972}I'm at the front with Ross.
{58978}{59048}It's Phoebe!
{59121}{59181}He looks pretty mad.
{59187}{59211}I better go.
{59217}{59313}Wait! Hold it up so I can listen.
{59450}{59536}- What we did last night was...|- Stupid.
{59542}{59597}Totally crazy, stupid.
{59603}{59666}What were we thinking?
{59672}{59768}I'm coming over|tonight though, right?
{59787}{59845}Definitely.
{60423}{60472}Friends, family...
{60478}{60526}... we are gathered to celebrate|here today...
{60532}{60640}...the joyous union|of Ross and Emily.
{60643}{60679}{Y:i}May the happiness of today...
{60685}{60717}...be with them always.
{60723}{60771}Now, Emily, repeat after me.
{60777}{60836}- I, Emily...|- I, Emily...
{60842}{60894}...take thee, Ross...|... take thee, Ross...
{60900}{60971}...as my lawfully wedded husband|in sickness and in health...
{60977}{61026}...till death parts us.
{61032}{61126}As my lawfully wedded husband,|in sickness and in health...
{61132}{61194}...until death parts us.
{61200}{61257}Now, Ross.
{61262}{61296}Repeat after me.
{61302}{61339}I, Ross...
{61345}{61372}I, Ross...
{61378}{61412}...take thee, Emily...
{61418}{61495}...take thee, Rachel...
{61554}{61629}Emily!
{61943}{62018}Shall I go on?

{56}{145}Friends, family,|we're gathered to celebrate...
{151}{235}...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.
{241}{300}Now Ross, repeat after me.
{306}{342}"I, Ross."
{348}{378}I, Ross.
{384}{420}"Take thee, Emily."
{426}{501}Take thee, Rachel.
{717}{760}Shall I go on?
{766}{810}He said "Rachel", right?
{816}{882}Do you think I should go up there?
{888}{934}Yes. Yes. Do go on.
{940}{1018}I think we'd better start again.
{1024}{1060}Repeat after me.
{1066}{1092}"I, Ross."
{1098}{1128}I, Ross.
{1134}{1220}"Take thee, Emily."
{1263}{1355}Take thee, Emily.
{1368}{1452}Like there'd be anybody else.
{1455}{1542}"As my lawfully wedded wife,|in sickness and in health...
{1548}{1585}...till death parts us."
{1591}{1705}As my lawfully wedded wife,|in sickness and in health...
{1711}{1773}...until death parts us.
{1779}{1848}Really, I do. Emily.
{1854}{1924}Do you have the rings?
{1946}{1998}Place this ring on Ross' finger...
{2004}{2108}...as a symbol of|your bond everlasting.
{2218}{2262}Ross, place this ring...
{2268}{2316}...on Emily's hand as a symbol...
{2322}{2392}...of the love that|encircles you forever.
{2398}{2465}Happy to.
{2478}{2528}They have made|their declarations...
{2534}{2682}...and it gives me great pleasure|to declare them husband and wife.
{2698}{2780}You may kiss the bride.
{2859}{2976}This is worse than when|he married the lesbian.
{3046}{3124}Just keep smiling.
{3188}{3252}Well, that went well.
{3258}{3370}It could've been worse.|He could've shot her.
{3398}{3498}That was pretty funny, wasn't it?
{3517}{3590}The One After|Ross Says "Rachel"
{4669}{4731}You spoiled everything!|It's a nightmare!
{4737}{4845}My friends and family are out there!|How can I face them?
{4851}{4903}No matter what happens with them...
{4909}{4982}...we still get cake, right?
{5005}{5148}That's all right. You take your time.|I'll be right out here.
{5154}{5213}She's just fixing her makeup.
{5219}{5243}I hate you!
{5249}{5350}And I love you!
{5370}{5466}A bad time|to say the wrong name, huh?
{5494}{5577}That's true. Thanks, Dad.
{5587}{5637}People should be dancing.
{5643}{5706}This is a party! Come on!
{5712}{5788}Joey! Dance!
{6044}{6089}Yes, Waltham Interiors.
{6095}{6242}This is Ross Geller's|personal physician, Dr. Filangie.
{6252}{6273}Who?
{6279}{6371}I discovered that Ross forgot|to take his brain medicine.
{6377}{6440}Without it, in the brain of Ross...
{6446}{6523}...women's names are interchangeable.
{6529}{6593}Through no fault of his own.
{6599}{6666}Oh, my God! Phoebe.
{6668}{6736}No, not Phoebe. Dr. Filangie.
{6742}{6828}Oh, no! You have it too!
{7073}{7155}I hope you don't take this|the wrong way...
{7161}{7231}...but I know we had plans|to meet up tonight.
{7237}{7338}I'm worried about what it|might do to our friendship.
{7344}{7387}I know.
{7393}{7514}- How could we have let this happen?|- Seven times!
{7525}{7594}You know, look.|We were away.
{7600}{7678}In a foreign, romantic country.
{7684}{7717}I blame London.
{7723}{7794}Bad London!
{7796}{7822}So, look...
{7828}{7922}...while we're still in London,|we can keep doing it, right?
{7928}{7993}Well, I don't see that|we have a choice.
{7999}{8062}But when we're back home,|we don't do it.
{8068}{8138}Only here.
{8139}{8213}You know, I saw|a wine cellar downstairs.
{8219}{8305}I'll meet you there in two minutes.
{8328}{8375}Mon? I got to ask you something.
{8381}{8403}Now?
{8409}{8517}Ross said my name.|I can't just pretend it didn't happen.
{8523}{8567}I don't know.
{8573}{8623}Monica, what should I do?
{8629}{8710}Just do the right thing.
{8743}{8817}Tow the line! Thread the needle!|Think outside the box!
{8823}{8902}I'll talk to Ross|about what he thinks it meant.
{8908}{8960}Wait! Rachel, no.
{8966}{8998}He's married.
{9004}{9032}Married.
{9038}{9110}If you don't realize that,|I can't help you.
{9116}{9162}Okay. You're right.
{9168}{9253}You're right.|You can't help me.
{9259}{9388}Jack, is it all our fault?|Were we bad parents?
{9403}{9475}Who serves steak|when there's no place to sit?
{9481}{9522}How are you supposed to eat this?
{9528}{9599}Hey, what's up?
{9617}{9657}We were supposed to meet.
{9663}{9712}- Forget it. That's off.|- Why?
{9718}{9798}The next tour of the wine cellar...
{9804}{9934}...will commence in two minutes.
{9942}{9978}Joey, what are you doing?
{9984}{10035}You promised, no meat|till Phoebe has the babies.
{10041}{10121}We're in another country,|so it doesn't count.
{10127}{10206}- True.|- He's got a point.
{10309}{10380}I'm sorry things aren't working out.
{10386}{10462}It could be better.|It'll be okay, right?
{10468}{10543}Oh, yeah! Of course.|She'll get over this.
{10549}{10581}So you said my name.
{10587}{10649}You just said it|because you saw me there.
{10655}{10718}If you'd seen a circus freak,|you would've said:
{10724}{10807}"I take thee, Circus Freak."
{10809}{10863}It didn't mean anything.|It's a mistake.
{10869}{10948}It didn't mean anything.|Right?
{10954}{11047}Oh, no! Of course|it didn't "mean" anything.
{11053}{11132}I can understand why Emily|thought it meant something...
{11138}{11168}...because it was you.
{11174}{11283}But it absolutely didn't.|It didn't! It didn't!
{11289}{11363}The band's ready|for your first dance with Emily.
{11369}{11432}Oh! The band's ready!
{11438}{11591}We got to do what the band says.|I don't care about the stupid band!
{11598}{11667}You spit on me, man!
{11673}{11711}I'm sorry.
{11717}{11785}Emily is taking kind of a long time.
{11791}{11843}When I locked myself up|at my wedding...
{11849}{11927}...I was trying to pop|the window out of the frame.
{11933}{12040}Get the hell out of there.|You know?
{12194}{12259}I'm coming in!
{12295}{12389}Oh, look at that.|Same thing.
{12459}{12604}In the middle of everything,|if I scream "Yippee!", just ignore me.
{12643}{12733}- Oh, my God! Rachel!|- Oh, hello, Rachel.
{12739}{12785}Ross said my name.
{12791}{12828}Okay? My name!
{12834}{12875}Ross said my name up there.
{12881}{12961}That obviously means|he still loves me!
{12967}{13015}Don't believe me.|I know I'm right.
{13021}{13072}Do you guys want to go|and get a drink?
{13078}{13144}Yes, we do.
{13149}{13195}But we have to change first.
{13201}{13266}Yes, I want to change.
{13272}{13340}- Go get a table.|- We'll only be five minutes.
{13346}{13419}Fifteen minutes.
{13521}{13558}Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
{13564}{13632}- Oh, hey, hey.|- Oh, great.
{13638}{13669}So what happened?
{13675}{13723}Well, Ross said my name.
{13729}{13787}But I don't think|that means anything.
{13793}{13843}Let's look at this objectively.
{13849}{13883}Ninth grade, right?
{13889}{13960}The obsession starts.
{13974}{14049}Then he sees me in|a two-piece for the first time.
{14055}{14117}His obsession begins to grow, right?
{14123}{14168}Why don't we go change in my room?
{14174}{14245}My clothes are...
{14597}{14623}Wow, you look...
{14629}{14701}No time for that.
{14761}{14868}Hey, dude! Let me in!|I got a girl out here!
{14874}{14934}I got a girl in here!
{14940}{15054}No, you don't.|I saw you go in with Monica.
{15064}{15132}Well, we're hanging out.
{15138}{15242}Which one of us will be|having sex in there? Me or you?
{15248}{15345}I suppose I would|have to say you.
{15351}{15424}- What if we're watching a movie?|- Which we are!
{15430}{15468}And we've paid for it.
{15474}{15528}It's "My Giant."
{15534}{15558}"My Giant"?
{15564}{15651}I love that movie!
{15733}{15765}Think this is okay?
{15771}{15842}Well, Ross and Emily|aren't going to use it.
{15848}{15936}Oh, it's so beautiful!
{15949}{16027}I don't feel right about this.
{16064}{16106}This is the honeymoon suite.
{16112}{16207}The room expects sex.
{16215}{16300}The room would be disappointed|if it didn't get sex.
{16306}{16434}All the other honeymoon suites|would think it was a loser.
{16538}{16630}Nope! Not under here!
{16664}{16720}- You didn't find her?|- I've looked everywhere.
{16726}{16788}You couldn't have,|or you would've found her.
{16794}{16813}Keep looking!
{16819}{16857}Yeah! For about 30 minutes?
{16863}{16935}Or forty-five?
{16963}{17063}In 45 minutes,|you could find her twice.
{17109}{17232}For all I know, she's trying to find me|but couldn't because I kept moving.
{17238}{17302}From now on,|I'm staying in one place.
{17308}{17379}Right here.
{17433}{17520}- It's getting late.|- We're going to go.
{17526}{17616}Do you guys mind staying here|for a while?
{17622}{17682}We got to get up early|and catch that plane.
{17688}{17773}Yeah, it's a very large plane.
{17798}{17869}That's cool.
{17896}{17957}But we'll stay here with you.
{17963}{18036}Thanks, guys!
{18053}{18189}I really appreciate this,|but you don't need to rub my butt.
{18444}{18493}We have to leave in an hour.
{18499}{18562}I know. I've been looking|at those doors.
{18568}{18642}They look pretty soundproof,|don't you think?
{18648}{18703}We can't do that.|That's insane.
{18709}{18793}I mean, A, he could wake up.|And B, you know...
{18799}{18869}...let's go for it.
{19078}{19139}Nope.
{19145}{19208}- She's not with us.|- We've come for her things.
{19214}{19264}Where is she?
{19270}{19374}She's in hiding. She's humiliated.|She doesn't want to see you again.
{19380}{19538}We're very sad that it didn't work out|between you and Emily, monkey.
{19540}{19638}But I think you're|absolutely delicious!
{19644}{19768}Excuse me,|I'm standing right here.
{19774}{19803}Oh, yes.
{19809}{19896}There you are.
{19914}{20002}Hurry up! Get some!|There's a whole cart outside.
{20008}{20030}Goodbye, Geller.
{20036}{20083}Now, hold on. Hold on.
{20089}{20207}Your daughter and I are supposed|to leave tonight for our honeymoon.
{20213}{20321}Tell her I'll be at that airport,|and I hope she will too.
{20327}{20399}I said Rachel's name,|but it didn't mean anything.
{20405}{20434}She's just a friend.
{20440}{20482}Tell Emily I love her and...
{20488}{20567}...I can't imagine spending my life|with anyone else.
{20573}{20692}Please, promise me that|you'll tell her that.
{20692}{20738}All right, I'll tell her.
{20744}{20797}Come on, bugger face!
{20803}{20853}Call me.
{20859}{21018}You spend your life in the bathroom.|Why do you never go out the window?
{21397}{21471}Maybe it's best we never|got to do it again.
{21477}{21589}Yeah, it kind of makes|that one night special.
{21644}{21756}Technically, we still are|over international waters.
{21762}{21889}I'm going to the bathroom.|Maybe I'll see you there?
{22032}{22104}Can I ask you something?
{22154}{22251}Felicity and I watched|"My Giant". And I thought...
{22257}{22335}...I'll never be as good an actor|as that giant.
{22341}{22465}Do you think I'm wasting my life|with this acting thing?
{22470}{22518}The giant's five years|younger than me.
{22524}{22606}You think I'll ever get there?
{22693}{22750}- Thanks, man.|- Okay, man.
{22756}{22843}But what about how much|taller he is than me?
{22849}{22944}I mean, there's no way|I can make myself taller now.
{22950}{23040}Who knows what science will|come up with in the future...
{23046}{23172}...but what if I die an unsuccessful,|regular-size man?
{23184}{23273}You've been in the|bathroom for a half-hour.
{23279}{23322}I know!
{23328}{23405}Had the beef tips, huh?
{23797}{23870}You ate meat!
{23889}{23950}You had sex!
{23973}{24002}No, we didn't.
{24008}{24105}I know you didn't.|I was talking about Monica.
{24111}{24145}I did not have sex.
{24151}{24226}This pregnancy is|throwing me all off.
{24232}{24298}- I'll say "hi" to the chick and duck.|- Me too!
{24304}{24367}Why would you need to?|You've been feeding them.
{24373}{24474}Oh, right.|Maybe I'll just go home.
{24697}{24730}We certainly are alone.
{24736}{24840}Good thing we have that|"not New York" rule.
{24856}{24929}Listen, since we're on that subject...
{24935}{25000}...I just wanted to tell you that...
{25006}{25078}I was going through|a hard time in London...
{25084}{25231}...with my brother getting married and|that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.
{25237}{25287}Well, anyway, I just...
{25293}{25414}That night meant a lot to me.|And I'm trying to say thanks.
{25480}{25540}You know, that night|meant a lot to me too.
{25546}{25622}It wasn't because I was|in a bad place or anything.
{25628}{25741}It just meant a lot because|you're really hot.
{25813}{25834}Is that okay?
{25840}{25891}That's okay.
{25897}{25958}And I'm cute too?
{25983}{26010}And you're cute too!
{26016}{26053}Thank you.
{26059}{26149}All right, I got to go unpack.
{26549}{26643}I'm still on London time.|Does that count?
{26644}{26729}- Oh, that counts!|- Oh, good!
{26981}{27017}What are you doing here?
{27023}{27140}I've been on standby for|a flight home for hours.
{27143}{27183}So no sign of Emily?
{27189}{27254}Not yet.
{27350}{27387}When do you have to leave?
{27393}{27485}{y:i}This is the last call|{y:i}for flight 1066 to Athens.
{27491}{27526}{y:i}The last call.
{27532}{27611}Pretty soon, I guess.
{27637}{27709}I'm sorry.
{27709}{27732}I don't understand.
{27738}{27784}How could she do this?
{27790}{27932}Am I a complete idiot for|thinking she'd actually show up?
{27934}{28052}You're not an idiot, Ross.|You're a guy very much in love.
{28058}{28090}Same difference.
{28096}{28218}{y:i}All passengers for flight 1066|{y:i}to Athens should now be on board.
{28224}{28295}I get it!
{28366}{28422}Well, that's that.
{28428}{28463}No, you know what?
{28469}{28537}I think you should go.
{28542}{28580}I think you should go...
{28586}{28643}...by yourself.|Get some distance.
{28649}{28712}Clear your head.|It would be really good.
{28718}{28758}I don't know.
{28764}{28866}Come on.|It would be really good for you.
{28887}{28974}I could do that.
{28976}{29037}I can't even believe her.
{29043}{29089}You know what?|I am going to go.
{29095}{29121}- Good.|- Why not?
{29127}{29158}- Right?|- Right.
{29164}{29187}Thanks.
{29193}{29228}I'll see you back at home.
{29234}{29321}If I ever get a flight out of here.
{29354}{29447}What? Wait, what?
{29451}{29483}Why don't you come?
{29489}{29586}I mean, I have two tickets.|Why not?
{29592}{29698}Well, I don't know, Ross.|Really?
{29704}{29767}Yeah. It'd be great.|I mean, you can...
{29773}{29816}You can lay on the beach...
{29822}{29902}...and I can cry over|my failed marriage.
{29908}{29973}You see how I make jokes?
{29979}{30025}Really. I mean...
{30031}{30069}I could use a friend.
{30075}{30195}Oh, wow. Maybe.
{30220}{30262}Yes, I can do that!
{30268}{30356}- Cool.|- All right, cool.
{30366}{30418}Okay, we're going to Greece.
{30424}{30468}I forgot my jacket!
{30474}{30528}Well, you tell them to wait.
{30534}{30606}Wait! Wait!
{31087}{31148}I'll have a glass of Merlot...
{31154}{31256}...and he'll have|a wine spritzer.
{31394}{31463}Look!|The airport's moving.
{31469}{31497}Are we moving?
{31503}{31581}Are we?|Why are we moving?
{31587}{31699}Does the captain know|that we're moving?
{31702}{31763}Oh, my gosh!
{294}{332}You look cute in bubbles.
{338}{432}You're just all liquored up.
{470}{557}Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.
{688}{761}I've had a very long, hard day.
{767}{798}Want some chicken?
{804}{890}No, thanks. No chicken.|Bye-bye.
{900}{958}You sure?|Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?
{964}{1019}For the last time, no!|Get out, Joey!
{1025}{1095}All right.
{1160}{1203}Are you okay?|He wouldn't leave.
{1209}{1269}He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.
{1275}{1327}Chicken?
{1333}{1410}I could eat some chicken.
{1509}{1619}Could I get a three-piece,|some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?
{1625}{1696}Diet Coke.
{1779}{1849}The One With|All the Kissing
{2702}{2770}- Morning, Pheebs.|- I have to tell you this story.
{2776}{2830}I was coming over|and this cabdriver...
{2836}{2899}Was his name Angus?
{2902}{2926}What?
{2932}{3023}He was a cabdriver|we had in London.
{3034}{3074}All right. Anyway...
{3080}{3134}What was that pub he took us to?
{3140}{3168}The Wheat Sheaf!
{3174}{3211}And they had that beer...
{3217}{3292}Boddington's!
{3332}{3383}Pheebs was going to tell a story.
{3389}{3454}So, he had a really funny hat.
{3460}{3552}I don't want to talk about it.
{3580}{3604}Hey Ross!
{3610}{3653}Boddington's!
{3659}{3718}Oh, man!
{3724}{3824}I'd walk back to London for another|frosty one of those bad boys.
{3830}{3904}They have them at the|British pub by the Trade Center.
{3910}{3964}Later!
{3970}{4006}Shouldn't Rachel be back?
{4012}{4048}Her plane got delayed.
{4054}{4096}But she should be here by now.
{4102}{4172}So you talked to her?|Did she sound mad?
{4178}{4246}No. But she likes me.
{4252}{4294}You abandoned her|on a plane to Greece.
{4300}{4369}I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?
{4375}{4419}Emily showed up at the airport.
{4425}{4499}I had to go after her.|I did what I had to do.
{4505}{4564}She's my wife.|Rachel is my wife.
{4570}{4635}Emily!
{4643}{4716}Emily is my wife.
{4722}{4788}Man, what is that?
{4794}{4838}You haven't heard from Emily?
{4844}{4894}Not since I lost her at the airport.
{4900}{4948}I can't believe she can outrun you.
{4954}{5021}Hey! She's fast, okay?
{5027}{5151}You think you can beat me?|Let's go! Outside!
{5268}{5378}Rach, I am so sorry.|I am so, so sorry.
{5384}{5482}Come on.|You just did what you had to do.
{5505}{5585}That's it? You're not mad?|It must've been terrible.
{5591}{5662}Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!
{5668}{5759}There was a nice hotel, nice beach,|met the nice people.
{5765}{5855}It's not too shabby for Rachel.
{5892}{5968}So, what, that's it?
{5970}{6046}We're cool. Totally cool.
{6052}{6093}Thanks, Rach.|You're the best.
{6099}{6184}Oh, no. You're the best.
{6190}{6269}Oh, I got to go to the flower store.
{6275}{6338}No one will tell me where Emily is...
{6344}{6443}...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red|roses to her parents' house.
{6449}{6518}One for each day|I've known and loved her.
{6524}{6563}That should get her talking.
{6569}{6710}When you make out the card,|be sure to make it out to "Emily".
{6784}{6875}It's good that you had|such a good time in Greece.
{6881}{6945}What?
{6947}{7014}I didn't have a good time in Greece!
{7020}{7072}Ross abandoned me!
{7078}{7179}I couldn't get a plane out.|I had to stay in their suite!
{7185}{7308}People came up to me going,|"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"
{7314}{7391}I mean, it was so humiliating!
{7397}{7447}I felt like such an idiot!
{7453}{7508}It's all my fault.|You know why?
{7514}{7594}Because I make very bad decisions.
{7600}{7629}Oh, that's not true.
{7635}{7718}Yes, it is true.|I went after Ross in stupid London!
{7724}{7828}London is stupid! Stupid!
{7828}{7874}I should've never gone to London.
{7880}{7968}From now on, you make|all my decisions for me.
{7974}{8034}Oh, no.|I did that for someone once.
{8040}{8134}I'm not comfortable having|that power over someone's life.
{8140}{8199}I'll do it.
{8205}{8317}Fine. Monica, you are now|in charge of my love life.
{8323}{8401}Okay. I got to go to work.
{8615}{8705}And Rachel, great to have you back.
{8962}{9032}Always a pleasure.
{9209}{9258}Rachel? Sweetie, look.
{9264}{9323}Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.
{9329}{9359}He's married.
{9365}{9444}Ross is married.|I still can't believe it.
{9450}{9514}Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
{9520}{9560}I'll just have to accept it.
{9566}{9614}I mean, it's my fault.
{9620}{9668}Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!
{9674}{9758}Oh, my God!
{9835}{9914}That's okay. I know that|you're very upset right now.
{9920}{9964}I know that wasn't about me.
{9970}{10023}I bet it was about her a little.
{10029}{10083}If you'd stop thinking about Ross...
{10089}{10157}...you'd notice there are|great guys everywhere.
{10163}{10227}Look. Gunther.
{10259}{10304}He's nice. He's cute.
{10310}{10363}Yeah. I guess Gunther is...
{10369}{10437}What about that guy over there?
{10443}{10539}That's the guy you flirted with|at the counter.
{10545}{10588}Oh, I don't know.|I don't know.
{10594}{10620}You'll too talk to him.
{10626}{10729}I make your decisions,|and I say you'll too talk to him.
{10735}{10762}All right.
{10768}{10844}You're the boss.|I got to do what you tell me.
{10850}{10940}Say that to him, and you're golden.
{11049}{11118}Hey, Pheebs.|We got our pictures back from London.
{11124}{11194}Here's all of us|at the Tower of London...
{11200}{11244}Here we all are.
{11250}{11347}There's Ross and Joey and you and...
{11347}{11409}And me.
{11415}{11476}We've been talking about|London too much.
{11482}{11549}Sorry, it's just because|I couldn't be there.
{11555}{11638}All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.|It bums me out.
{11644}{11698}- I'm sorry.|- Sorry.
{11704}{11778}- What happened?|- A little of this, a little of that.
{11784}{11824}I got myself a date tomorrow.
{11830}{11963}See? Didn't I tell you?|You're getting over Ross already.
{11968}{12026}Get out.
{12378}{12398}What took so long?
{12404}{12520}I got caught up at work.|But I'm quitting tomorrow.
{12604}{12694}So, thanks for having me over.
{13090}{13162}See you, man.
{13197}{13247}What the hell was that?
{13253}{13356}Probably some European|goodbye thing he picked up in London.
{13362}{13414}That's not European.
{13420}{13495}It felt French.
{13583}{13626}I really had a good time.
{13632}{13702}Yeah, me too.
{13750}{13813}I guess this is it.
{13838}{13927}Unless you want to come inside?
{13950}{14077}Wait a minute. You know what?|I can't decide this.
{14098}{14181}Okay. Just hold on a second.
{14304}{14360}Where's Monica?|I have to ask her something.
{14366}{14407}Doing her laundry.
{14413}{14456}What's that?
{14462}{14539}It came in the mail today.
{14545}{14602}It's 72 long-stemmed, red roses.
{14608}{14677}One for each day|I've known and loved Emily...
{14683}{14772}...cut up into mulch.
{14784}{14847}Honey, that's awful.
{14853}{14875}It's not so bad.
{14881}{14975}Monica's going to make potpourri.
{15014}{15117}I think I'm going to go|wander out in the rain for a while.
{15123}{15148}It's not raining.
{15154}{15242}I can't catch a break!
{15248}{15326}You're not going anywhere.|Sit right here.
{15332}{15406}I'll make you some tea|and we'll talk this out.
{15412}{15475}All right?
{15530}{15573}Hey, Dave.
{15579}{15674}I need to take a rain check.|My roommate is really sick.
{15680}{15741}Okay. Bye!
{15794}{15842}Honey, listen.
{15848}{15921}I know things seem so|bad...
{15927}{15989}...and that they won't get any...
{15995}{16061}Could I talk to you?
{16067}{16142}I dropped some socks.
{16337}{16449}What is the matter with you?|Do you want to fall into the trap?
{16455}{16524}You did not drop any socks!
{16530}{16582}I saw Dave, and he said|you blew him off!
{16588}{16610}You listen to me!
{16616}{16709}I'm calling the shots!|I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.
{16715}{16741}What are you doing?
{16747}{16857}Well, ultimately I was trying,|you know, I wanted...
{16863}{16928}...to tell him that|I'm still in love with him.
{16934}{17006}What? You cannot tell him that!
{17012}{17044}Why? Why not?
{17050}{17137}People love to hear that!
{17137}{17188}I make the decisions and I say no!
{17194}{17281}You know what? No, you don't|make my decisions, because...
{17287}{17323}...you're fired.
{17329}{17369}You can't fire me.
{17375}{17520}I make your decisions,|and I say I'm not fired! Ha!
{17537}{17602}Well...
{17814}{17846}Come on, let me in!
{17852}{17911}Having some trouble?
{17917}{17948}Rachel locked the door.
{17954}{18063}I'll kick that door in|if you give me some sugar.
{18164}{18253}Rachel! Let me in!
{18412}{18475}Thank you.
{18508}{18608}Rachel? Can I talk to you|outside for a sec?
{18647}{18678}We really need to talk.
{18684}{18728}Well, then talk.
{18734}{18810}Okay, I will.
{18845}{18949}Remember that thing we just discussed|that you wanted to do?
{18955}{19015}What thing?
{19067}{19138}Rachel wants to take|swing dance lessons.
{19144}{19204}Which I think is a really stupid idea.
{19210}{19284}It's dangerous.|She won't get what she wants.
{19290}{19399}And who knows who she might|end up hurting?
{19513}{19632}Monica's right.|Swing dancing can be tricky.
{19647}{19678}I have to use the phone.
{19684}{19778}I got to cancel those five, giant|teddy bears I sent to Emily.
{19784}{19864}My God! Think of the massacre.
{19870}{19898}I'm going to do it.
{19904}{19946}I know you think I'm crazy.
{19952}{20026}But before you tell him,|try to find one person...
{20032}{20087}...who thinks it's a good idea.|I bet you can't.
{20093}{20156}Please?
{20173}{20241}All right. Fine.
{20312}{20358}Joey! I'm in!
{20364}{20451}All right. Good deal.
{20750}{20834}You know how you were saying|you didn't get to go to London...
{20840}{20882}...and you were feeling left out?
{20888}{20957}Well, we all felt really bad|about that...
{20963}{21049}...so we decided to|take a little trip together!
{21055}{21102}Oh, that's so nice!
{21108}{21157}How great!|Where's the trip?
{21163}{21258}Well, we thought we would all|go to a picnic...
{21264}{21296}...in Central Park!
{21302}{21352}Central Park?
{21358}{21404}All of us. All day.
{21410}{21462}That sucks!
{21468}{21524}That's not a trip!|I just came from there.
{21530}{21599}What'll we high-five about|at the stupid park?
{21605}{21712}It's right by my house.|All right!
{21719}{21836}I'm going home to bask in the|triumph of my Central Park idea.
{21842}{21929}Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.
{21935}{21976}I wanted to talk to you about...
{21982}{22058}...this whole new European thing|you've got going on.
{22064}{22139}And I need to say|it makes me very uncomfortable...
{22145}{22227}...and I just, you know, just stop it!
{22233}{22296}Just bringing some culture|to the group.
{22302}{22379}That's fine.|Just don't bring it in my mouth.
{22385}{22465}It makes me want to puke.
{22596}{22689}Hey, everybody!|Pheebs is here!
{22712}{22796}- Phoebe! Woo!|- Okay. Woo! Hi!
{22802}{22892}Pheebs, we decided that|the picnic idea was a little...
{22898}{22992}It didn't have any...|Well, it blew.
{23014}{23121}We thought that this afternoon we'd|all go away for the whole weekend...
{23127}{23158}...to Atlantic City.
{23164}{23269}Atlantic City! Oh, that's|a great plan! Whose plan was that?
{23275}{23316}Mine!
{23322}{23394}- Wait. It was my plan.|- No...
{23400}{23455}...I said we needed a new plan.
{23461}{23509}And I came up with Atlantic City.
{23515}{23600}Which is the new plan.
{23635}{23732}Why don't we all|meet upstairs in an hour.
{23737}{23859}I'm going to go pack.|I'm going to go pack my ass off.
{23894}{23914}Let's go.
{23920}{23987}You know what?|I'll meet you in a minute.
{23993}{24079}Rachel, you didn't find anyone,|so you can't tell him.
{24085}{24157}You know what?|That doesn't matter.
{24163}{24253}Do you know how painful it is|to tell someone you love them...
{24259}{24340}...and not have them say it back?
{24350}{24431}I don't care.
{24485}{24564}I can't watch.
{24883}{24947}What you reading?
{24953}{24973}Paper.
{24979}{25060}Yeah? What's it about?
{25070}{25172}The events from around the globe.
{25259}{25322}There's something|I have to talk to you about.
{25328}{25368}Everyone's saying I shouldn't.
{25374}{25452}But I think they're wrong.|People can be wrong.
{25458}{25488}Once at work...
{25494}{25556}...I thought carbon dating|is fossilized...
{25562}{25665}I'm really trying to tell|you something here.
{25688}{25749}Go ahead.
{25755}{25808}I think I'm just going to say it.
{25814}{25885}I'm just going to say it.
{26062}{26153}I'm still in love with you.
{26519}{26626}I'm not sure what to do|with that right now.
{26725}{26831}What? Was that a joke?|Because it's mean.
{26859}{26921}I'm so dead serious!
{26927}{26963}I'm totally serious!
{26969}{27037}Why are you laughing?
{27064}{27112}Because I just heard it!
{27118}{27166}I heard it! And it's ridiculous!
{27172}{27199}I mean...
{27205}{27236}You're married!
{27242}{27299}You're married,|and it's just ridiculous!
{27305}{27389}When I said it, I sort of|floated up out of my body.
{27395}{27545}And then I heard myself say it,|and then the floating Rachel...
{27575}{27692}I was like, "You are such an idiot!"
{27754}{27826}- Well, I am married.|- I know.
{27832}{27943}Though I haven't spoken to her|since the wedding.
{27990}{28071}I'm sorry. That's not funny.
{28077}{28187}Actually, it kind of is.
{28214}{28302}My wife won't return my calls.
{28345}{28435}I don't know where my wife is.
{28477}{28590}"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"|"Don't know!"
{28608}{28677}Oh, God!
{28723}{28847}You know what?|Could you forget I told you this?
{28864}{28901}Well, I kind of have to.
{28907}{28949}Because the thing is...
{28955}{29082}The thing is, you know,|that you're married to Emily.
{29110}{29194}That is what the thing is.
{29265}{29313}Oh, God.
{29319}{29422}Things won't be weird between us,|right? Was that stupid?
{29428}{29468}Me telling you that?
{29474}{29555}I'm glad you did.
{29560}{29597}If nothing else...
{29603}{29698}...it's always great when someone|tells you they love you.
{29704}{29777}That's what I said!
{29802}{29930}- Thank you for being so nice.|- No. Thank you for...
{29940}{30010}Thank you.
{30025}{30091}- Okay, let's go!|- Yeah, Atlantic City!
{30097}{30120}Come on!
{30126}{30194}Atlantic City, baby!
{30200}{30244}Let's roll some bones.|Hey, Joey!
{30250}{30325}High-five for rolling bones.
{30420}{30455}Pheebs, you're leaking.
{30461}{30546}Oh, my God! Your water broke!
{30573}{30654}Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.
{30660}{30759}Pheebs, we have to take you|to the hospital now.
{30765}{30823}Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
{30829}{30926}Honey! High-five!|The babies are coming!
{30940}{31021}Remember when my water broke?
{31124}{31188}Phoebe's going to have her babies!
{31194}{31286}I know.|It's beautiful and amazing.
{31420}{31518}I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel|every time I left the room.
{31524}{31608}It's too bad they didn't|see us having sex.
{31614}{31703}Do you know anything about women?
{31725}{31801}- It's all right.|- Okay.
{140}{220}I'm Phoebe Buffay and I have|babies coming out.
{226}{285}Have you started having contractions?
{291}{385}Not yet. I heard they really hurt.|Do they?
{391}{446}Oh, my God!
{452}{488}Which of you is the father?
{494}{603}None of them are.|The father is my brother.
{633}{749}I'll miss watching you|freak people out like that.
{755}{817}This is for the babies|to look at someday.
{823}{923}Do you want to say anything|before it starts?
{928}{1008}Hi, kids! It's me, Aunt Phoebe.
{1014}{1126}Can't wait to see you.|Please don't hurt me!
{1154}{1188}What took you so long?
{1194}{1284}Your cab left when ours did.
{1337}{1440}We went back because|I forgot my jacket.
{1523}{1573}You're not wearing one.
{1579}{1667}Oh, man!|I did it again!
{1673}{1726}Someone has to call|Frank and Alice.
{1732}{1785}My mom might...|What are you doing?
{1791}{1879}I've got to get the "before" shot!
{1888}{1960}The One Hundredth
{3117}{3208}We spoke to the nurse.|The reason your doctor is late...
{3214}{3281}...is because she's not coming.
{3287}{3350}She hit her head in the shower.
{3356}{3431}Oh, my God. She's so stupid!
{3437}{3482}Pheebs, it's going to be okay.
{3488}{3616}I don't see three kids|coming out of your vagina!
{3664}{3738}Listen. The nurse said|the doctor is wonderful.
{3744}{3788}He's head of the department.
{3794}{3855}All right. Oh, dear God, save me!
{3861}{3925}I'm having my first contraction!
{3931}{4004}Oh! It's not bad.
{4024}{4127}And so the miracle of birth begins.|And I...
{4133}{4183}You okay?
{4189}{4213}Something hurts.
{4219}{4298}It's sympathy pains.|That's so sweet!
{4304}{4386}I didn't know I cared that much.
{4451}{4538}I'm Dr. Harad.|I'll be delivering your babies.
{4544}{4623}You'll be in good hands.|I've been doing this a long time.
{4629}{4686}I'll be back to do your internal.
{4692}{4744}Just relax, everything looks great.
{4750}{4849}And also, I love Fonzie.
{4892}{4953}Did he just say he loves Fonzie?
{4959}{5015}That's what it sounded like.
{5021}{5084}All right.
{5149}{5227}Am I late?|Nobody came out yet, right?
{5233}{5295}No, we haven't started yet.|Where's Alice?
{5301}{5382}Delaware. Until she gets here,|I'll be your coach.
{5388}{5475}Don't worry. She told me|about the LaMazda stuff.
{5481}{5541}If you get the babies out|by month's end...
{5547}{5629}...you get two percent financing.
{5719}{5779}Monica, you're going to be|very proud of me.
{5785}{5871}I just got us dates with two|unbelievably cute nurses.
{5877}{5937}Oh, my!
{5943}{5992}They're male nurses.
{5998}{6048}Not in my head.
{6054}{6189}They want to take us out|Saturday night! What do you say?
{6279}{6327}I don't think so.
{6333}{6368}What're you talking about?
{6374}{6463}You've been telling me to|get over Ross and move on.
{6469}{6518}I'm moving on and so are you.
{6524}{6597}Why don't you want to go?
{6619}{6680}Why don't you give me|a good reason...
{6686}{6779}...and I'll tell you if it's true.
{6783}{6863}- What?|- Harder than it sounds, isn't it?
{6869}{6928}You're coming.|And when they get off...
{6934}{7008}...we'll go get some Jello with them.
{7014}{7116}There's always room for Jello.
{7161}{7208}How do you make that dirty?
{7214}{7293}It's easy.|I can do it with anything.
{7299}{7404}Grandma's chicken salad...
{7594}{7648}Get a shot of this.
{7654}{7721}These are the headlines|when you were born.
{7727}{7817}Now girl baby, turn away.|And boy babies...
{7823}{7878}...check it out!
{7884}{7944}This is what naked women|looked like when you were born.
{7950}{8041}Now let's dive into the good stuff.
{8047}{8107}Okay, I'm having another one!
{8113}{8219}This one doesn't hurt eith...|Yes it does!
{8321}{8406}I was kind of hoping that was it.
{8434}{8487}Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?
{8493}{8563}A couple of nurses asked them out.
{8569}{8603}Really? Male nurses?
{8609}{8683}Yeah, I was bummed too.
{8689}{8733}So they're going on dates?
{8739}{8832}- When?|- I think Saturday.
{8838}{8907}- What's with him?|- Sympathy pains.
{8913}{9054}It was sweet at first, but now I think|he's trying to steal my thunder.
{9087}{9138}Let's see what we got here.
{9144}{9254}Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.
{9256}{9325}This Fonzie person you|keep referring to...
{9331}{9380}...is that another doctor?
{9386}{9409}Oh, no, no.
{9415}{9510}Fonzie is the nickname of|Arthur Fonzerelli.
{9516}{9578}"The Fonz."
{9609}{9668}All right.
{9729}{9788}It's not that weird, is it?
{9794}{9828}It's very weird!
{9834}{9984}I don't want some guy down there|telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo".
{10003}{10072}He doesn't seem to be|impersonating Fonzie...
{10078}{10133}What are you doing?
{10139}{10217}Why are you defending him?|Just get me another doctor...
{10223}{10282}...who isn't crazy|and doesn't Fonzie!
{10288}{10350}Again, it's not...
{10497}{10548}Hey, there you are!
{10554}{10597}There's something you should know.
{10603}{10675}Is this about you dating the nurse?|Joey told me.
{10681}{10793}I am so fine. You and I,|we're just, nothing.
{10799}{10869}Just goofing around.
{10922}{10993}I was about to tell you|I was getting out of it.
{10999}{11090}But if we're just "goofing around",|maybe I will go out with him.
{11096}{11183}Fine. Maybe I will too.
{11204}{11291}Hey! Look what I found|in the gift shop...
{11297}{11389}Get up! Get up! Get up!
{11508}{11552}This is Dr. Oberman.
{11558}{11621}He has no strong feelings|about Fonzie...
{11627}{11721}...or any of the "Happy Days" gang.
{11727}{11798}You're going into what grade?
{11804}{11889}I'm actually a first-year resident.|I graduated early.
{11895}{11953}Me too.
{11959}{12051}I should have specified|I'd need a grown-up doctor.
{12057}{12096}Really, I'm fully qualified...
{12102}{12164}"Doogie!"
{12189}{12302}Doesn't anybody understand that|I'm going to be having babies soon?
{12308}{12392}Go, little boy! Go!
{12448}{12541}Oh, cool. You made him cry!
{12623}{12740}Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid|you've got kidney stones.
{12746}{12789}Well, what else could it be?
{12795}{12863}It's kidney stones.
{12869}{12889}Or...
{12895}{12970}Kidney stones.
{13042}{13073}You're getting there.
{13079}{13133}These babies are very, very lucky.
{13139}{13163}They are? Why?
{13169}{13280}They'll be born|on the Fonz's half-birthday.
{13303}{13349}Happy Birthday.
{13355}{13401}Just to clarify.
{13407}{13484}I'm not Fonzie.
{13657}{13761}It's a terrific thing you're having|these babies for Frank and Alice.
{13767}{13821}I know, it is.
{13827}{13891}Can I tell you a secret?
{13897}{13979}I want to keep one.
{14059}{14144}Oh, I'm going to be on the news.
{14210}{14240}You must be kidding.
{14246}{14308}You know you can't keep|one of these babies.
{14314}{14361}Maybe I can. You don't know.
{14367}{14463}I do. Frank and Alice will|want to keep all their children.
{14469}{14532}Maybe not. You know?
{14538}{14587}Three babies are a handful.
{14593}{14684}Maybe they'll want to unload one.
{14689}{14822}I hate to miss an opportunity|because I didn't ask.
{14838}{14889}Phoebe, no.|This is insane.
{14895}{14921}Just ask him.
{14927}{14967}What? Me?
{14973}{14996}I can't ask him!
{15002}{15108}Do you know how inappropriate|that would be?
{15114}{15173}All I'm saying is,|just talk to Frank.
{15179}{15210}Just feel him out.
{15216}{15339}No. I will not ask Frank|to give you one of his kids.
{15348}{15410}You're right.
{15513}{15596}Tell him it's for you.
{15617}{15654}Feeling better, sweetie?
{15660}{15701}Maybe a little.
{15707}{15780}Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
{15786}{15854}Me too.
{15892}{15926}I just heard. What's up?
{15932}{16014}Kidney stones!
{16054}{16150}Ordinarily, we try to break|the stones up with shock waves.
{16156}{16212}But they're too close to the bladder.
{16218}{16352}Either we wait for you to pass them|or else go up the urethra...
{16392}{16497}No, no, no, no.|Nothing is going "up", okay?
{16503}{16619}"Up" is not an option.|What's a urethra?
{16659}{16724}Are you crazy?
{16772}{16810}Did you ask him?
{16816}{16860}No, I haven't had a chance yet.
{16866}{16943}I'm kind of on a clock here.
{16977}{17050}Oh, Fonzie.
{17099}{17192}You know who I always liked?|Mork.
{17242}{17316}Undo it. Undo it.
{17339}{17375}Fonzie met Mork.
{17381}{17464}Mork froze Fonzie.
{17562}{17665}But Fonzie was already cool.
{17669}{17746}So he wasn't hurt. Right?
{17752}{17822}Yeah, that's right.
{17859}{17893}How you doing?
{17899}{17956}Okay. Doctor says any minute now.
{17962}{18047}You know, Alice is going|to be here so soon.
{18053}{18207}You couldn't just do me a favor|and, like, hold them in?
{18211}{18335}Sorry, I'm in the middle of|the last favor you asked me to do.
{18393}{18519}This is Dan, one of the guys|we're dating on Saturday.
{18524}{18587}Nice to meet you.
{18652}{18784}I'm really looking forward|to Saturday night. Really!
{18823}{18853}So Dan...
{18859}{18918}Nurse, not a doctor, huh?
{18924}{18996}Kind of girlie, isn't it?
{19043}{19174}That's okay. I'm doing this to|get through medical school.
{19213}{19281}And it didn't feel "girlie"|during the Gulf War.
{19287}{19354}Sure.
{19411}{19514}Thanks for doing that for us,|by the way.
{19560}{19613}Why wait till Saturday?|Are you free tomorrow?
{19619}{19663}Sure.|I'll get somebody to cover me.
{19669}{19706}Great!
{19712}{19758}Hey, you and me, Saturday night?
{19764}{19849}- No.|- All right, very good!
{19888}{19964}This is a big one.
{19998}{20076}Get these things out of me!
{20082}{20195}Breathe! Breathe through the pain.
{20232}{20283}I want the drugs, Ross!
{20289}{20389}I do too! I do too!
{20424}{20534}Yeah, I love you.|Okay, bye.
{20552}{20622}That was Alice's mom.|Alice left five hours ago.
{20628}{20658}She should be here.
{20664}{20742}She'll make it on time.
{20757}{20805}So Frank...
{20811}{20893}Three babies.|That just seems like a lot, huh?
{20899}{20974}Not to me.
{20982}{21045}Fair enough.
{21123}{21206}You're at ten centimeters.|Time to start having babies.
{21212}{21268}I want only the father here.
{21274}{21354}- We love you.|- Good luck.
{21486}{21556}I need a clamp, a sterile towel|and Channel 31.
{21562}{21634}What is that?
{21692}{21711}Oh, my God!
{21717}{21830}Oh, no, no! It's a good one.|Fonzie plays the bongos.
{21836}{21880}Ready? Time to try pushing.
{21886}{21967}Ready? Time to try peeing.
{22033}{22171}Wait, wait, wait, wait!|It's almost time to try peeing.
{22189}{22250}Push. Concentrate on pushing.
{22256}{22283}I see the head.
{22289}{22369}Yes, it is a head!
{22374}{22403}Keep pushing. Come on.
{22409}{22468}I can't believe somebody's coming out!
{22474}{22539}There's somebody coming out of you!
{22545}{22566}It's my son!
{22572}{22645}All right.
{22647}{22732}Here's your first baby!
{22804}{22881}Yes! We got a baby boy!
{22888}{22946}Frank Junior, Junior!
{22952}{22981}How does he look?
{22987}{23057}So gross!
{23104}{23151}Okay. You ready to push again?
{23157}{23211}I already had a baby.|Leave me alone!
{23217}{23334}Come on, you can do it!|You can do it!
{23534}{23612}Little Leslie's here!|We got another one!
{23618}{23721}Oh, my God! I can't believe|I have two children.
{23727}{23809}How scary is that?
{23859}{23983}Come on, little Chandler,|it's time to be born.
{23989}{24084}He's coming!|Yes, he's coming!
{24146}{24229}Hey, where's his thing?
{24293}{24367}Chandler's a girl!
{24378}{24463}Oh, God! Kindergarten flashback.
{24469}{24557}They read the sonogram wrong,|because they thought it was a boy.
{24563}{24611}But Chandler's a girl!
{24617}{24686}Okay, keep saying it.
{24692}{24763}- Am I too late?|- No, no. Everything's okay.
{24769}{24833}There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
{24839}{24904}We have our babies?
{24923}{24988}We have our babies.
{25309}{25346}Oh, my God!
{25352}{25412}You did it, man.
{25418}{25499}Would you like to see them?
{25549}{25634}They're so small.
{25774}{25859}- I'll call you tomorrow.|- Great.
{25926}{26012}Are you really going to date|that nurse man?
{26018}{26073}You and I are just|"goofing around".
{26079}{26179}I thought, why not|"goof around" with him?
{26211}{26312}I don't know if you've looked up|"goofing around" in the dictionary.
{26318}{26356}Well, I have...
{26362}{26458}...and the technical definition is...
{26464}{26578}..."two friends who care a lot|about each other...
{26584}{26683}...and have amazing sex...
{26709}{26810}...and just want to spend|more time together."
{26816}{26910}But if you have this new|dictionary that gets you mad at me...
{26916}{27018}...then we have to get you|my original one.
{27053}{27111}I am so bad at this.
{27117}{27210}- You're better than you think you are.|- Really?
{27216}{27236}Okay. So if...
{27242}{27340}- Know when to stop.|- I sensed that I should stop.
{27346}{27407}So we're okay?
{27409}{27514}I'm gonna go tell Dan that|it's not going to happen.
{27562}{27644}- Don't do the dance.|- Right.
{27726}{27760}You're my favorite.
{27766}{27874}- Which one do you have?|- I don't care.
{27949}{28042}Frank and Alice want me to tell you|they're making phone calls.
{28048}{28154}Did you talk to them|about, you know...
{28219}{28305}No, honey.
{28372}{28454}It was a long shot.
{28484}{28609}You guys? Can I just have|a second alone with the babies?
{29123}{29191}So here you are.
{29197}{29324}Seems like yesterday I was talking|to you in that petri dish.
{29438}{29503}Everyone said labor was|the hardest thing.
{29509}{29594}But they were wrong. This is.
{29649}{29736}Well, I had the most fun|with you guys.
{29742}{29854}I wish I could take you home|and see you every day.
{29896}{29999}I'll settle for being|your favorite aunt.
{30007}{30129}I know Alice's sister has a pool,|but you lived in me.
{30229}{30297}Okay, so we're cool.
{30303}{30384}We're going to be great.
{30388}{30469}Little high-fives.
{30672}{30759}Well, if you're going to cry...
{31115}{31206}Phoebe, we are so proud of you.|You're amazing!
{31212}{31272}I know.
{31281}{31331}Does it hurt as bad as they say?
{31337}{31424}You won't be able to take it.
{31428}{31511}Now that little Chandler is a girl,|what'll they name her?
{31517}{31571}They'll call her Chandler.
{31577}{31682}Kind of a masculine name,|don't you think?
{31686}{31746}It works on you.
{219}{256}Come in.
{262}{361}I've been waiting for you.
{401}{449}Hi, I just...
{455}{499}Oh, my God!|Monica!
{505}{539}Oh, my God!
{545}{590}I'm sorry! I was...
{596}{629}I was taking a nap.
{635}{746}Since when do you|take naps in that position?
{762}{842}Tell me you were waiting for a guy.|Please tell me.
{848}{910}Yes, I was.|A guy.
{916}{962}From work.
{968}{1056}I'm seeing a guy from work!
{1079}{1208}That cute waiter guy that looks like|a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
{1214}{1249}That one!
{1255}{1342}Give me a second.|I'm just going to grab a jacket.
{1348}{1479}When I get back,|I want every little detail.
{1515}{1596}Maybe that's him.
{1653}{1709}It's just Joey and Ross.
{1715}{1748}Why aren't you at the movie?
{1754}{1834}Ross was so loud, they threw us out.
{1840}{1958}I had to talk loud|because the movie was loud!
{1974}{2062}- He's talking to London.|- Did he get in touch with Emily?
{2068}{2185}No, not yet. He's hoping that someone|will help him get in touch with her.
{2191}{2341}I don't care if I said some|other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
{2351}{2441}Way to suck up to the family!
{2580}{2740}I'm so glad you're all here. My office|finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!
{2772}{2842}The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS
{3968}{4034}No, no! Vomit tux!
{4040}{4089}Don't worry,|I had it dry-cleaned.
{4095}{4125}Vomit tux?
{4131}{4177}Who vomited on...
{4183}{4254}You know what?|What you up to, Joe?
{4260}{4324}They're doing|this telethon thing on TV.
{4330}{4389}And my agent|got me a job as cohost!
{4395}{4430}That's great!
{4436}{4530}A little good deed for PBS,|plus some TV exposure.
{4536}{4634}That's the kind of math|Joey likes to do.
{4640}{4691}Oh, PBS!
{4697}{4800}- What's wrong with PBS?|- What's right with them?
{4801}{4841}Why don't you like PBS?
{4847}{5007}Right after my Mom killed herself,|I was in a bad place, personally.
{5030}{5093}I thought I'd write|to "Sesame Street".
{5099}{5170}Because they were nice|when I was a little kid.
{5176}{5215}No one ever wrote back.
{5221}{5326}A lot of those muppets|don't have thumbs.
{5338}{5437}All I got was a lousy keychain, and|by that time, I was living in a box.
{5443}{5505}I didn't have keys!
{5511}{5541}I'm sorry, Pheebs.
{5547}{5628}I wanted to do a good deed,|like you did with the babies.
{5634}{5734}This isn't a good deed. You just|want to get on TV. This is selfish.
{5740}{5835}What about you having|those babies for your brother?
{5841}{5916}That's selfish!
{5925}{5967}What are you talking about?
{5973}{6049}It was a nice thing,|but it made you feel good, right?
{6055}{6084}Yeah, so?
{6090}{6154}It made you feel good|so that makes it selfish.
{6160}{6241}Look, there's no|unselfish good deeds. Sorry.
{6247}{6336}Yes, there are totally|good deeds that are selfless!
{6342}{6385}May I ask for one example?
{6391}{6459}Yeah, it's...|You know, there's...
{6465}{6544}No, you may not!
{6549}{6600}Because all people are selfish.
{6606}{6652}Are you calling me selfish?
{6658}{6751}Are you calling you people?
{6772}{6894}Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs,|but selfless good deeds don't exist.
{6900}{6959}You know the deal|on Santa Claus?
{6965}{7125}I'll find a selfless good deed.|I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!
{7249}{7302}Oh, my God! It's Emily!
{7308}{7393}It's Emily, everyone!
{7440}{7527}I'm only ringing to say|stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.
{7533}{7625}You can hang up, but I'll keep calling|everyone in England...
{7631}{7730}...if that's what it takes|to get you to talk to me.
{7736}{7765}Really? About what?
{7771}{7839}Look, you're my wife.|We're married.
{7845}{7881}You know, I love you.
{7887}{7976}{y:i}I really miss you.
{7978}{8023}I miss you too.
{8029}{8075}{y:i}At least, I think I do.
{8081}{8161}She's talking.
{8251}{8319}When you said "the deal with Santa",|you meant...?
{8325}{8360}That he doesn't exist.
{8366}{8433}Right.
{8513}{8631}Chandler, have you heard|about Monica's secret boyfriend?
{8632}{8705}Yeah, she might have mentioned him.
{8711}{8820}So, Mon, when are we going|to meet this new, secret waiter man?
{8826}{8894}I don't think he's|up to meeting everyone yet.
{8900}{8965}Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.
{8971}{9090}I want to meet this guy|who's the best sex she ever had.
{9096}{9163}Really?
{9175}{9237}That's what you heard?|You said that?
{9243}{9309}I might have.
{9350}{9400}Why is that funny?
{9406}{9470}Because I'm very happy for him.
{9476}{9568}And you!|You lucky dog!
{9635}{9699}She's willing to work|on the relationship.
{9705}{9729}That's great!
{9735}{9770}In London.
{9776}{9831}She wants me to move to London.
{9837}{9899}But you live here.
{9945}{10012}You know that.
{10024}{10058}What will you do?
{10064}{10125}I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...
{10131}{10221}...I could convince them|to move to London with Ben.
{10227}{10293}I'm sure your ex-wife|would be more than happy to move...
{10299}{10403}...so you can patch things up|with your new wife.
{10423}{10501}It could happen.
{10591}{10677}How you doing? Welcome.|Good to see you.
{10683}{10754}This'll be your phone.
{10814}{10844}That's great.
{10850}{10929}But I'm not really|expecting a lot of calls.
{10935}{10992}No, you answer it|and take pledges.
{10998}{11023}But I'm the host.
{11029}{11143}Gary Collins is the host.|You'll be answering the phone.
{11149}{11245}You don't seem to understand.|I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.
{11251}{11346}Well, here's your phone, Doctor.
{11376}{11444}I can't believe I can't find|a selfless good deed.
{11450}{11505}You know that old guy|that lives next to me?
{11511}{11592}I snuck over there and raked up|the leaves on his front stoop.
{11598}{11732}But he caught me, and he|force-fed me cider and cookies.
{11741}{11830}Then I felt wonderful.|That old jackass!
{11836}{11919}Maybe Joey's right.|Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
{11925}{12007}I will find a selfless good deed.|I gave birth to three children...
{12013}{12141}...and I won't let them be raised|in a world where Joey's right!
{12169}{12227}Can I ask you a cooking question?
{12233}{12280}If you're cooking on the stove...
{12286}{12416}...that means your new boyfriend|is better in bed than Richard?
{12481}{12548}Is he?
{12558}{12662}I think I'll respect the privacy|of my new, secret boyfriend.
{12668}{12735}Why?
{12756}{12789}If this guy was me...
{12795}{12897}...and it's me who'd learned that it was|me who was the best you'd ever had...
{12903}{12970}...I'd be like this:
{13184}{13209}{y:i}All right, Emily.
{13215}{13255}As much as I love you...
{13261}{13350}...I'm sorry, I can't|move to London without Ben.
{13356}{13415}I understand that would be difficult.
{13421}{13510}Would you consider moving here?|You were moving here anyway.
{13516}{13570}{y:i}Why can't you just do that?
{13576}{13659}I don't know. It's just...
{13674}{13792}But I know that even though I've been|a complete idiot up till now...
{13798}{13844}...you have to come here.
{13850}{13939}{y:i}You have to, so we can|{y:i}work this out together.
{13945}{13995}All right.
{14001}{14039}Did you just say "all right"?
{14045}{14105}I did.|Now I'm the idiot.
{14111}{14161}Emily, that is so great!
{14167}{14194}{y:i}It'll be great!
{14200}{14332}We're going to be|like two idiots in love!
{14384}{14452}There's one thing that|really scares me still.
{14458}{14514}- Yes, tell me.|{y:i}- You must understand...
{14520}{14588}...how humiliating it was|for me at the altar...
{14594}{14648}...in front of my family and friends.
{14654}{14721}I know. I am so sorry.
{14727}{14819}And then, after deciding|to forgive you...
{14825}{14913}...seeing you at the airport,|catching our plane with her.
{14919}{15016}Again, very sorry.
{15026}{15097}I mean, I can't be|in the same room as her.
{15103}{15205}It drives me mad thinking of you|being in the same room as her.
{15211}{15333}Emily, there is nothing|between Rachel and me.
{15339}{15407}{y:i}I love you.
{15413}{15455}All right.
{15461}{15554}I'll come to New York,|and we'll try to make this work.
{15560}{15586}That's so great!
{15592}{15716}As long as you|don't see Rachel anymore.
{15865}{15945}I asked Emily|if she would come to New York.
{15951}{15989}And she said yes.
{15995}{16056}Great!
{16076}{16151}Only if I promise|never to see Rachel again.
{16157}{16191}What? You can't...
{16197}{16221}What did you say?
{16227}{16374}I'd think about it. How am I|supposed to make this decision?
{16386}{16477}I'm actually asking you!
{16480}{16591}Rachel is one of your best friends.
{16600}{16639}But Emily's his wife!
{16645}{16712}That's true!
{16725}{16795}You can't just cut Rachel|out of your life!
{16801}{16874}That's true!
{16880}{16971}Thanks for the help.|Problem solved!
{17135}{17193}When will you be on TV?
{17199}{17270}There was kind of a mix-up|in my agent's office...
{17276}{17355}...but I'm still on TV,|and that's good exposure.
{17361}{17431}You're not on TV.
{17488}{17564}How about now?
{17589}{17624}There he is!
{17630}{17711}{y:i}Hello, New York!
{17721}{17801}{y:i}Maybe just put the whole duck in there.|{y:i}Who cares?
{17807}{17881}{y:i}Now I got the legs.
{17941}{18091}How many times have I told you|to never watch the cooking channel?
{18121}{18194}I need that broiling pan|that Joey borrowed.
{18200}{18238}That was yours?
{18244}{18353}We used it when the duck|was throwing up caterpillars.
{18359}{18424}Williams-Sonoma,|fall catalog, page 27.
{18430}{18505}Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.
{18548}{18619}Joey's at the telethon|for the rest of the day.
{18625}{18669}We have the place to ourselves.
{18675}{18709}Yeah, so?
{18715}{18855}Maybe you'd want to book some time|with "the best you've ever had".
{18861}{18907}You know what, champ?
{18913}{18948}I think I'll pass.
{18954}{19011}Why?
{19329}{19401}What's your point?
{19461}{19529}PBS Telethon.
{19535}{19639}I just wanted to let you know|that I found a selfless good deed.
{19645}{19732}I went down to the park|and I let a bee sting me.
{19738}{19791}What good is that going to do?
{19797}{19895}It helps the bee look tough|in front of his bee friends.
{19901}{19968}The bee is happy,|and I am definitely not.
{19974}{20096}You know, the bee probably|died after he stung you.
{20179}{20246}Damn it!
{20258}{20347}Back on in 30 seconds, people!
{20483}{20554}Excuse me,|would you mind switching with me?
{20560}{20625}No way.|I'm in the shot, man.
{20631}{20704}- You've been here all day!|- I'm taking pledges.
{20710}{20782}And we're on three, two...
{20788}{20835}Welcome back to our fall telethon.
{20841}{20909}If you've been enjoying|{y:i}Cirque du Soleil...
{20915}{21009}...and you'd like to see more,|it's very simple.
{21015}{21087}All you have to do|is call in a pledge...
{21093}{21251}...and tell one of our volunteers|what type of programming you...
{21313}{21408}That's it. I cannot make this decision.|It is too difficult.
{21414}{21527}I leave it entirely|up to the gods of fate.
{21556}{21589}A Magic 8 Ball?
{21595}{21657}You can't make this decision|with a toy!
{21663}{21748}It's not a toy.
{21749}{21805}I don't know what else to do!
{21811}{21914}I either keep my wife|and lose one of my best friends...
{21920}{22010}...or I get divorced|for the second time before I'm 30.
{22016}{22097}If anyone else has|a better suggestion, let's hear it.
{22103}{22159}Because I got nothing!|Don't be shy.
{22165}{22256}Any suggestion will do.
{22351}{22426}Okay, then.
{22466}{22530}Here we go.
{22536}{22573}Magic 8 Ball...
{22579}{22683}...should I never see Rachel again?
{22737}{22801}"Ask Again Later."
{22821}{22918}Later is not good enough!
{23034}{23054}"Ask Again Later."
{23060}{23087}What the hell?
{23093}{23175}This is broken! It is broken!
{23181}{23238}Let me see.
{23244}{23318}Will Chandler have sex tonight?
{23324}{23390}"Don't Count On It."
{23461}{23546}Seems like it works to me.
{23576}{23617}PBS Telethon.
{23623}{23645}{y:i}Hi, Joey.
{23651}{23675}Hey, Pheebs.
{23681}{23718}I'd like|to make a pledge.
{23724}{23770}I would like to donate $200.
{23776}{23805}Two hundred dollars?
{23811}{23877}You sure?|After what "Sesame Street" did to you?
{23883}{23942}I'm still mad at them,|but they bring happiness...
{23948}{24068}...to lots of kids|whose moms didn't kill themselves.
{24075}{24195}By supporting them, I'm doing a good|thing, but I'm not happy about it.
{24201}{24260}So there!|A selfless good deed.
{24266}{24329}You don't feel good|about donating the money?
{24335}{24429}No, it sucks!|I was saving up to buy a hamster.
{24435}{24497}A hamster?|Those things are, like, $10.
{24503}{24564}Not the one I had my eye on.
{24570}{24665}{y:i}It looks like we have surpassed|{y:i}last year's pledge total.
{24671}{24710}{y:i}Thank you!
{24716}{24834}{y:i}And the pledge that did it|{y:i}was taken by one of our volunteers.
{24840}{24978}{y:i}Oh, boy! And may I say,|{y:i}one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.
{24984}{25035}{y:i}Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
{25041}{25066}Oh, look!
{25072}{25110}Joey's on TV!
{25116}{25145}Isn't that great?
{25151}{25237}My pledge got Joey on TV!|That makes me feel so...
{25243}{25310}Oh, no!
{25451}{25470}Look...
{25476}{25577}...I got carried away before,|but there's something you got to know.
{25583}{25728}If I'm the best, it's only|because you made me the best.
{25739}{25794}Keep talking.
{25800}{25840}I was nothing before you.
{25846}{25915}Call the other girls and ask.
{25921}{25987}Which wouldn't take long.
{25993}{26072}But when I'm with you,|and we're together...
{26078}{26178}...oh, my God!
{26281}{26366}Oh, my God!
{26405}{26500}I understand if you never|want to sleep with me again.
{26506}{26570}But that'd be wrong.
{26576}{26617}We're too good.
{26623}{26719}We owe it to sex!
{26742}{26799}If we owe it!
{26850}{26916}Oh, my!
{26922}{26955}When will Joey be home?
{26961}{27061}I was kind of hoping|we could do this without him.
{27071}{27149}No, no, no!|Leave the gloves on.
{27155}{27190}I cleaned the bathroom.
{27196}{27286}Why don't we lose the gloves.
{27336}{27446}All right.|Let's show them how it's done.
{27471}{27568}- That wasn't part of it.|- I know.
{27899}{27955}You ready?|We're going to be late.
{27961}{28031}- For what?|- For Stella, remember?
{28037}{28141}She's getting her groove back|in 20 minutes.
{28141}{28219}I totally forgot about that.
{28225}{28333}Can I take a rain check?|I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
{28339}{28382}Sure, I guess.
{28388}{28486}I hear you don't have to|go to London.
{28505}{28624}It's not that easy. There's still|a lot of relationship stuff.
{28630}{28655}Like what?
{28661}{28698}Just stuff.
{28704}{28804}You know, kind of what Emily wants.
{28810}{28896}Talk to me.|Maybe I can help.
{28926}{29001}You can't help.
{29039}{29134}I have to do this|without your help.
{29166}{29306}I know you can do that too.|I'm just saying if you need to talk...
{29365}{29432}Thanks.
{29503}{29569}Whatever it is that Emily wants...
{29575}{29622}...just give it to her.
{29628}{29685}The bottom line is that you love her.
{29691}{29753}Fix whatever she wants fixed.
{29759}{29830}Just do it.
{29836}{29973}You're going to have to try.|You'll hate yourself if you don't.
{30025}{30095}Come on, answer it!
{30153}{30206}Hi, sweetie.
{30212}{30269}Good.
{30316}{30384}Yes, I've been thinking...
{30390}{30521}...about that thing|you wanted me to do.
{30521}{30583}I can do it.
{30606}{30701}Will you come to New York?
{31686}{31771}- Never done that before.|- Nope.
{599}{635}What time is it?
{641}{706}Nine.
{727}{770}But it's dark out.
{776}{866}That's because you always|sleep till noon, silly.
{872}{953}This is what nine looks like.
{959}{1020}I guess I'll get washed up then.
{1026}{1101}Watch that sunrise.
{1141}{1206}I'm getting tired of always|sneaking around.
{1212}{1315}Me too. What if we went away|for the weekend? No interruptions.
{1321}{1377}We could be naked|the entire time.
{1383}{1465}All weekend?|That's a whole lot of naked.
{1471}{1563}I'll say I have a conference|and you can have a chef thing.
{1569}{1640}I wanted to go to this|culinary fair in Jersey!
{1646}{1722}Okay.|You know you're not, though.
{1728}{1768}- Let's go.|- Okay. Wait.
{1774}{1844}What about Joey?
{2006}{2077}The One with the Kips
{3134}{3228}I'm going to a culinary fair|in Jersey this weekend.
{3234}{3359}How weird! Chandler just said|he's got a conference there.
{3366}{3458}That's funny. Seems like|Chandler's conference could've been...
{3464}{3542}...in Connecticut or Vermont.
{3559}{3642}I'm not in charge of where|the conference is held.
{3648}{3780}Do you want people to think it's fake?|It's a real conference.
{3796}{3870}- Is Rachel here?|- No, she's out shopping.
{3876}{3947}- Damn!|- What's going on?
{3953}{3988}I told Emily to come.
{3994}{4122}And I just need to, you know,|talk to Rachel about it.
{4128}{4163}Wait a minute.
{4169}{4246}When Emily comes,|you won't see Rachel anymore?
{4252}{4327}I'm focusing on the|"I get to see my wife" part...
{4333}{4439}...and not on the part|that makes me do this.
{4476}{4536}So you'll never be|in a room together?
{4542}{4582}How will that even work?
{4588}{4631}I have no idea.|I mean...
{4637}{4748}But I assure you,|I will figure it out.
{4769}{4859}It doesn't seem like it'll work.
{4874}{4940}Hi, guys.
{4941}{4988}What's going on?
{4994}{5087}We're flipping Monica's mattress.
{5112}{5246}So I'm thinking, basically,|we pick it up, and then we flip it.
{5256}{5334}That's better than my way.
{5339}{5401}Hey guys, would you flip mine too?
{5407}{5481}Oh, man.
{5523}{5621}Oh, look! A letter from my mom.
{5629}{5688}So, Rach?
{5694}{5746}You know how Emily's coming?
{5752}{5793}Oh, yeah. I know.
{5799}{5835}Can you hear anything?
{5841}{5949}Yeah, somebody just said,|"Can you hear anything?"
{6033}{6120}Hey, Joey's ass.
{6143}{6167}What are you doing?
{6173}{6228}Remember when they fought|and broke up...
{6234}{6308}...and we were stuck here|all night with no food?
{6314}{6423}When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,|I figured it'd happen again.
{6429}{6478}So I hid this in here.
{6484}{6537}Candy bars, crossword puzzles...
{6543}{6624}"Mad Libs"! Mine!
{6647}{6704}Condoms?
{6734}{6803}You don't know how long|we'll be in here.
{6809}{6896}We may have to|re-populate the Earth.
{6916}{7019}And condoms are the way to do that?
{7032}{7117}Anyway, it all boils down to this.
{7123}{7261}- The last time I talked to Emily...|- Oh, my God! Our dog died!
{7267}{7371}- What?|- Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!
{7377}{7465}LaPooh's still alive?
{7471}{7585}It says he was hit by|an ice-cream truck and dragged for...
{7591}{7679}...nineteen blocks!
{7694}{7765}- Oh, my God.|- Sweetie, we heard you crying.
{7771}{7837}- Please don't cry.|- It's LaPooh!
{7843}{7959}I know, it's LaPooh right now|but it'll get better.
{8085}{8166}I can't believe it! We're here!
{8172}{8235}Chocolates on the pillows!|I love that!
{8241}{8346}You should live with Joey.|Rolos everywhere.
{8367}{8427}I'll be right back.
{8539}{8587}Oh, yes!
{8593}{8667}Get in here.|It's a high-speed car chase on!
{8673}{8714}We're switching rooms.
{8720}{8790}Oh, dear God!|They gave us glasses!
{8796}{8853}The glasses have lipstick on them.
{8859}{8957}Who knows what else|they didn't change?
{8961}{8982}Sweetie...
{8988}{9045}...I just want this weekend|to be perfect.
{9051}{9111}We can change rooms, can't we?
{9117}{9249}Okay, but let's do it now.|Chopper Five just lost its feed!
{9331}{9446}You know how there was something|I wanted to talk to you about?
{9452}{9517}Oh, yeah.
{9547}{9662}I'm trying to work|things out with Emily.
{9662}{9695}Well, there's this...
{9701}{9784}...one thing.
{9821}{9895}Here goes.
{9933}{9983}I made a promise that...
{9989}{10033}- What?|- Your nose is bleeding.
{10039}{10062}Oh, God!
{10068}{10099}You're bleeding.
{10105}{10132}Not again.
{10138}{10198}This happened when|my grandfather died.
{10204}{10241}Sorry.
{10247}{10274}Gross.
{10280}{10399}Okay. So I'm sorry.|What did you want to tell me?
{10558}{10628}Sorry. Sorry.
{10709}{10757}I can't see you anymore.
{10763}{10879}I know, it's ridiculous.|I can't see you, either.
{10901}{11027}- I think you'll like this room more.|- Okay, great.
{11069}{11153}They say he's only got|half a tank left.
{11159}{11254}Half a tank? Still lots|of high-speed chasing to do!
{11260}{11335}- We're switching rooms again.|- What? Why?
{11341}{11420}This has a garden view.|We paid for an ocean view.
{11426}{11569}Our last ocean-view room|was unacceptable to you.
{11569}{11699}Excuse me. Can I talk to you|over here for just a second?
{11813}{11901}These clowns want to take us|for a ride. I won't let them.
{11907}{11978}We're not a couple of suckers.
{11984}{12048}I hear you, Mugsy.
{12049}{12095}All these rooms are fine.
{12101}{12162}Just pick one so I can watch the...
{12168}{12294}Have a perfect, magical|weekend together with you?
{12356}{12400}- This one I like.|- Nothing.
{12406}{12447}Nothing. It's over. Damn it!
{12453}{12543}This is regularly scheduled|programming!
{12549}{12582}Can we turn the TV off?
{12588}{12660}Do we really want to spend|the weekend like this?
{12666}{12759}Am I getting in the way|of the room-switching fun?
{12765}{12808}Don't blame me for tonight.
{12814}{12889}Who should I blame?|The nice bellman?
{12895}{12952}Or the idiot who thought|he could drive...
{12958}{13047}...from Albany to Canada|on half a tank of gas?
{13053}{13144}Do not speak ill of the dead.
{13149}{13245}We're supposed to be spending|a romantic weekend together.
{13251}{13280}What's the matter?
{13286}{13347}I just want to watch|a little television.
{13353}{13433}Jeez, relax, Mom.
{13468}{13506}What did you say?
{13512}{13625}I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."
{13907}{14012}I've been wanting to tell you something|and I just have to get it out.
{14018}{14092}Okay. What's up?
{14167}{14266}You know how you said to do|whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
{14272}{14368}Yeah, I told you to give Emily|whatever she wants.
{14374}{14531}And while that was good advice,|you should know that what she wants...
{14587}{14719}...is for me not to see you anymore.
{14737}{14889}That's crazy! You can't do that.|What are you going to tell her?
{14984}{15050}Oh, my God!
{15056}{15122}You've already agreed to this.
{15128}{15188}It's awful, I know.
{15194}{15282}But I have to do this|if I want my marriage to work.
{15288}{15432}And I do. I have to make|this marriage work. I have to.
{15506}{15649}But the good thing is, we can still|see each other until she gets here.
{15691}{15783}Lucky me! Oh, my God!|That is good news, Ross!
{15789}{15906}That's the best news I've heard|since LaPooh died!
{15939}{16057}You have no idea what a nightmare|this has been. This is so hard.
{16063}{16117}Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?
{16123}{16212}- Let me make this easier for you.|- What are you doing?
{16218}{16271}- Storming out.|- It's your apartment.
{16277}{16374}Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!
{16694}{16774}Damn Rolos!
{16781}{16843}You're back!|How was your conference?
{16849}{16950}It was terrible. I fought with|my colleagues for the entire time.
{16956}{17023}Are you kidding with this?
{17029}{17073}So your weekend was a bust?
{17079}{17194}No, I got to see Donald Trump|waiting for an elevator.
{17221}{17256}You're back too.
{17262}{17318}Could I talk to you for a second?
{17324}{17396}- How was your chef thing?|- It was awful.
{17402}{17464}Some people don't|appreciate good food.
{17470}{17535}Maybe the food tasted good at first...
{17541}{17650}...but then made everybody vomit|and have diarrhea.
{17811}{17866}How much was the room?|I'll pay my half.
{17872}{17897}Fine. $300.
{17903}{17926}$300?
{17932}{18019}Just think of it as $25 per room.
{18079}{18141}What are you guys woofing about?
{18147}{18242}Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!
{18294}{18358}You know what?|Now that I think about it...
{18364}{18438}...I constantly find myself|without 20s, and you...
{18444}{18524}...always have lots.
{18618}{18673}You should've seen|the look on her face.
{18679}{18762}I don't want Rachel to hate me.|I don't know what to do.
{18768}{18822}- You want my advice?|- Yes. Please.
{18828}{18902}- You won't like it.|- That's okay.
{18908}{18999}You got married too fast.
{19001}{19095}- That's not advice.|- I told you.
{19139}{19219}I'm going to the bathroom.
{19224}{19327}If anyone asked me to give up|any of you, I couldn't do it.
{19333}{19363}Me neither.
{19369}{19438}Maybe I could do it.
{19538}{19604}I know you guys heard about|me and Ross.
{19610}{19717}But I've been obsessing about it|and would love not to talk about it.
{19723}{19796}I don't know if this falls|under that category...
{19802}{19863}...but Ross is right back there.
{19869}{19921}- That's not Ross.|- Not that guy.
{19927}{20001}He does look like him, though.
{20007}{20050}Ross is in the bathroom.
{20056}{20163}Oh, my God! It's happening.|It's already started. I'm Kip.
{20169}{20208}Yeah, you're not Kip.
{20214}{20285}Do you even know who Kip is?
{20291}{20386}Who cares? You're Rachel.
{20404}{20441}Who's Kip?
{20447}{20508}My old roommate.|We all hung out together.
{20514}{20583}Oh, that poor bastard.
{20589}{20664}You told me the story.|He and Monica dated.
{20670}{20770}When they broke up, you all|promised you'd stay his friend.
{20776}{20838}And what happened?|He got phased out.
{20844}{20908}- You won't be phased out.|- Of course, I am.
{20914}{21019}It won't happen to Ross. He's your|brother, your college roommate.
{21025}{21076}It was just a matter of time.
{21082}{21189}I just assumed Phoebe|would be the one to go.
{21204}{21261}You live far away,|you're not related.
{21267}{21339}You lift right out.
{21501}{21543}Hey, Mr. Bing.
{21549}{21638}That hotel you stayed at called.
{21644}{21750}Someone left an eyelash curler|in your room.
{21776}{21854}Yes, that was mine.
{21860}{21935}I figured you met|a girl and she left it.
{21941}{22018}That would have made more sense.
{22024}{22111}I don't even feel like|I know you anymore.
{22117}{22200}All right, I'm just going|to ask you this one time.
{22206}{22291}Whatever you say,|I'll believe you.
{22297}{22363}Were you or were you not...
{22369}{22441}...on a gay cruise?
{22863}{22969}I'm sorry about the whole|"lifting out" thing.
{22982}{23027}You got to come with me.
{23033}{23069}- Where?|- Wherever I go.
{23075}{23193}You and me, we'll start a new group.|We're the best ones.
{23261}{23359}Okay, but try to get Joey too.
{23397}{23474}Pheebs, do you mind if I|speak to Rachel alone?
{23480}{23545}Sure.
{23583}{23612}Bye, Ross.
{23618}{23689}Forever.
{23809}{23917}Why are you here?|Isn't this against the rules?
{23944}{24009}I talked to Monica.
{24039}{24097}Look, I'm the one|who made the choice.
{24103}{24168}I'm the one who's making|things change.
{24174}{24256}So I should be the one to,|you know, step back.
{24262}{24334}No, no, it's okay. Really.
{24340}{24431}Plenty of people just see their|sisters at Thanksgiving...
{24437}{24502}...their college roommates|at reunions...
{24508}{24614}...and Joey at Burger King.
{24699}{24762}Is that better?
{24816}{24887}No, it's not better.
{24893}{24982}I still don't get to see you.
{25006}{25132}What would you do?|If you were me, what would you do?
{25301}{25414}First, I'd have said|the right name at my wedding.
{25553}{25632}I can't believe this.
{25697}{25751}I know.
{25757}{25842}I am so sorry.
{25844}{25923}I know that too.
{26084}{26104}Hey, Rach?
{26110}{26253}Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said|you want to talk to me about a trip?
{26431}{26490}I just came over to drop off...
{26496}{26564}...nothing.
{26628}{26685}So that weekend kind of sucked.
{26691}{26733}Yeah, it did.
{26739}{26824}So I guess this is over?
{26841}{26948}You know, you and me.|I mean, it had to end sometime.
{26954}{26989}Why exactly?
{26995}{27063}Because of the weekend.|We had a fight.
{27069}{27137}Chandler, that's crazy.
{27143}{27197}If you always gave up|after a fight...
{27203}{27304}...you'd never be with anyone|longer than...
{27443}{27510}This isn't over?
{27521}{27600}You are so cute!
{27627}{27692}No, no. It was a fight.
{27698}{27813}You deal with it and you move on.|It's nothing to freak out about.
{27819}{27895}Really? Okay, great!
{27917}{28019}Welcome to an adult relationship.
{28059}{28144}We're in a relationship?
{28169}{28241}I'm afraid so.
{28418}{28493}I heard you saw Donald Trump|at your convention.
{28499}{28586}Saw him waiting for an elevator.
{28632}{28692}Can I use your eyelash curler?|I lost mine.
{28698}{28769}It's in the bathroom.
{28904}{28994}Can I talk to you for a second?
{29271}{29313}Yes.
{29319}{29373}Yes.
{29379}{29403}You?
{29409}{29466}And you?
{29472}{29530}But you cannot tell anyone.|No one knows.
{29536}{29586}But how? When?
{29592}{29685}- It happened in London.|- In London!
{29714}{29803}We didn't want to make|a big deal out of it.
{29809}{29934}But it is a big deal!|I have to tell someone!
{29941}{29960}You can't.
{29966}{30038}We just don't want to deal with|telling everyone.
{30044}{30140}Please just promise you won't tell.
{30188}{30255}All right.
{30264}{30322}Man, this is unbelievable!
{30328}{30372}I mean, it's great!
{30378}{30416}But...
{30422}{30489}I know. It's great!
{30491}{30579}I don't want to see that!
{30622}{30676}We're so stupid.
{30682}{30819}Do you know what's going on in there?|They're trying to take Joey!
{30929}{31030}"The most popular Phoebe in tennis|is called the overhand Phoebe."
{31036}{31158}"If you win, slap your opponent|on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe'!"
{31164}{31233}That's cute.|We really all enjoyed it.
{31239}{31292}- But it doesn't count.|- For what?
{31298}{31406}Just count in our heads|as good Mad Libs.
{31412}{31470}- I got to go.|- Fun's over.
{31476}{31527}Wait, if we follow the rules...
{31533}{31588}...it's still fun|and it means something.
{31594}{31626}I'm going to take off.
{31632}{31681}Guys, rules are good!
{31687}{31775}Rules help control the fun.
{173}{280}None of that.|Not while you're under my roof!
{297}{402}Just because I know about you|doesn't mean I like looking at it.
{408}{463}Aren't you supposed to be|at an audition?
{469}{575}I'm sorry I'm not|a middle-aged black woman.
{587}{716}I'm also sorry if sometimes|I go to the wrong audition.
{745}{800}If I pretend to not know about you...
{806}{905}...then you pretend|there's nothing to know.
{907}{964}Sorry.
{1072}{1155}I can hear that!
{1162}{1235}Rachel's at work.
{1333}{1420}I can still hear you!
{1426}{1498}The One with the Yeti
{2587}{2614}What's that?
{2620}{2711}My mom sent me an heirloom|that belonged to my grandmother.
{2717}{2739}Can you believe it?
{2745}{2880}A year ago I had no family,|and now I have heirlooms!
{3089}{3146}Oh, God!
{3185}{3242}Soft.
{3248}{3285}Is this mink?
{3291}{3419}Why would my mother send me a fur?|Doesn't she know me but at all?
{3425}{3528}I have a fine coat that no innocent|animals suffered to make.
{3534}{3608}Just Filipino kids who worked|their fingers bloody...
{3614}{3684}...for 12 cents an hour.
{3719}{3792}I made that up.
{3876}{3942}You can't put up flyers in here.
{3948}{4008}How come?|Everybody else does.
{4014}{4086}You can't.
{4117}{4185}What is that?
{4193}{4258}I'm getting rid of some things.
{4264}{4329}This is all of your things.
{4335}{4380}Yes, it is.
{4386}{4470}It's good. Emily thinks|we should get all new stuff.
{4476}{4547}Stuff that's just ours.|Together. Brand new.
{4553}{4626}So it's a get-rid-of-anything-|Rachel-ever-touched sale.
{4632}{4699}Touched, used, sat on, slept on...
{4705}{4780}I'll take it all.
{4786}{4820}You're okay with that?
{4826}{4870}If I can just do what Emily wants...
{4876}{4942}...and get her to New York,|it will be fine.
{4948}{4996}Isn't that a little extreme?
{5002}{5073}After what I did, can you blame her?
{5079}{5100}You got off easy.
{5106}{5173}When my friend's husband said|another name in bed...
{5179}{5272}...she cursed him|and turned his thingy green.
{5405}{5447}What is he doing?
{5453}{5568}Emily thinks Ross' furniture|has got Rachel cooties?
{5574}{5604}Calm down, Joey.
{5610}{5659}Everything's getting all messed up!
{5665}{5707}Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.
{5713}{5752}We won't stop seeing Rachel.
{5758}{5831}Hence, Ross stops seeing us.
{5837}{5889}I hate this.|Everything's changing.
{5895}{5995}We're losing Ross.|Joey said "hence".
{6058}{6166}I'm not happy about this either,|but if Ross says he's happy...
{6172}{6242}...then we have to keep|our feelings to ourselves.
{6248}{6317}Are you cool with that?
{6358}{6413}But, you know, I'm an actor.
{6419}{6500}I'll act cool.
{6642}{6713}Storage rooms give me the creeps.
{6719}{6784}Please hurry up, honey.
{6790}{6886}If you want little round waffles,|wait till I find the iron.
{6892}{6958}I want the little round waffles.
{6964}{7007}Here it is!
{7013}{7079}Right underneath the can of bug bomb.
{7085}{7222}Is the best place to put something|that cooks food underneath poison?
{7228}{7325}You know what?|I'll have toast.
{7385}{7472}Fog him! Fog him!
{7590}{7642}I don't know what to do|about this coat.
{7648}{7693}I'll take it.
{7699}{7770}That might work.
{7885}{7924}What do you think?
{7930}{8020}You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.
{8047}{8109}No, it's just a bit sudden.
{8115}{8189}It's great, okay?|I am totally on board.
{8195}{8278}I love you too.|All right, bye.
{8327}{8355}What's the matter?
{8361}{8419}Nothing. No, actually...
{8425}{8464}...great news!
{8470}{8518}I just spoke with Emily...
{8524}{8635}...and looks like I'm moving|to a new apartment.
{8664}{8683}Why?
{8689}{8751}Her thought is, and I agree...
{8757}{8858}...fresh new furniture,|why not a fresh new apartment?
{8864}{8909}Her cousin has a place to sublet.
{8915}{8981}It's got a view|of the river and Columbia.
{8987}{9042}That's way uptown!|That's three trains away...
{9048}{9084}...which is great!
{9090}{9179}I love to ride that rail.
{9181}{9223}You're okay with this?
{9229}{9292}It's kind of far from work...
{9298}{9394}...but I'll get so much done|on the commute.
{9400}{9477}I've been given the gift of time.
{9483}{9584}That's so funny. Last Christmas|I got the gift of space.
{9590}{9703}We should get them together|and make a continuum.
{9769}{9798}Now he's moving?
{9804}{9902}Man, what is Emily doing to him?
{9908}{9987}He's not even here!
{9992}{10023}You guys!
{10029}{10117}We were in the storage area,|and we saw this creepy man.
{10123}{10199}It was this crazy-eyed,|hairy beast-man.
{10205}{10311}It was like a Big Foot|or a yeti or something.
{10314}{10377}He came at us,|so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.
{10383}{10501}I pulled the tab|and I just fogged his yeti ass.
{10511}{10591}Like, dark hair, bushy beard?
{10597}{10663}Yeah, you fogged Danny.
{10669}{10743}Please! We did not fog Danny.
{10749}{10796}Who's Danny?
{10802}{10832}Danny just moved in.
{10838}{10953}He just got back from a four-month|trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
{10959}{11033}He's nice.|You know, you always...
{11039}{11140}...stick up for the people we fog.
{11377}{11492}You might not remember us,|but we're the girls that fogged you.
{11498}{11585}We're really sorry we fogged you.
{11764}{11824}Just so you know,|we didn't mean to fog you.
{11830}{11943}We thought you were|like a yeti or something.
{12113}{12227}Sorry to bother you, but we can't|accept your acceptance of our apology.
{12233}{12337}It doesn't really seem|like you mean it.
{12465}{12494}That guy is so rude!
{12500}{12557}Really!|What is with that guy?
{12563}{12628}You'd forgive me if I fogged you?
{12634}{12691}You did, a little bit.
{12697}{12761}Oh, my God, honey.|I'm so sorry.
{12767}{12853}- I totally forgive you.|- Really?
{12980}{13060}You know my friend Chris|who owns the crematorium?
{13066}{13134}Crematorium Chris? Sure.
{13140}{13228}He said he would cremate|my fur coat for free...
{13234}{13355}...if I bring in the next person|I know who dies.
{13448}{13527}Oh, my God.|Look at these pelts!
{13533}{13640}Don't get too attached.|She's having it cremated.
{13690}{13781}You're quirky, and I get a big kick|out of it. We all do.
{13787}{13842}But if you destroy|a coat like this...
{13848}{13929}...that is like a crime|against nature.
{13935}{13993}Not nature. Fashion!
{13999}{14032}This is fashion?
{14038}{14094}So to you, death is fashion?
{14100}{14126}That's funny.
{14132}{14188}Here's Phoebe...
{14194}{14273}...sporting cutting edge|hairy carcass...
{14279}{14403}...from, you know, the steel traps|of wintry Russia.
{14409}{14469}You really think this looks good?
{14475}{14555}Because I do!
{14680}{14733}I miss you too.|I can't wait to see you.
{14739}{14782}I love you. Bye.
{14788}{14837}What is in here, rocks?
{14843}{14916}No, it's my collection|of fossil samples.
{14922}{14999}So, rocks.
{15192}{15242}I'll miss this apartment.
{15248}{15359}You know, Ben took his first steps|right over there.
{15365}{15489}Remember when I ran into this|and it knocked me out?
{15495}{15534}I love this place.
{15540}{15624}To tell the truth,|I wish I didn't have to move.
{15630}{15737}Are you saying that you're not|entirely happy about this?
{15743}{15802}If Emily gave me a choice...
{15808}{15865}You do have a choice!
{15871}{15983}Why are you listening to her?|Are you crazy?
{15987}{16084}It's not right what Emily wants|you to do. She's totally...
{16090}{16139}Stop pinching me!
{16145}{16264}You guys said to keep my mouth shut|if Ross was happy, right?
{16270}{16390}He just told me|that he's not entirely happy.
{16404}{16441}What's going on?
{16447}{16511}We all hate Emily!
{16555}{16613}No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.
{16619}{16688}We just think that|you're having to sacrifice...
{16694}{16777}...a whole lot to make her happy.
{16793}{16891}We just think that maybe|she's being a little unreasonable.
{16897}{16948}Yes, unreasonable.
{16954}{17006}Unreasonable?
{17012}{17102}How about we have this conversation|when one of you marries?
{17108}{17188}You have no idea what it takes|to make a marriage work.
{17194}{17256}It's compromise.|Do you always like it? No.
{17262}{17287}Do you do it? Yes.
{17293}{17372}Because it's not all laughing,|happy, candy in the sky...
{17378}{17416}...coffee at Central Perk.
{17422}{17456}It's real life, okay?
{17462}{17575}It's what grownups do.
{17695}{17734}I think he's right.
{17740}{17850}You guys hang out at|the coffeehouse way too much.
{17984}{18061}- I feel so guilty about Ross.|- I know.
{18067}{18160}I kind of feel like it's my fault.
{18185}{18227}Kind of?
{18233}{18299}You should have kept this to yourself.
{18305}{18451}I'm keeping so many things to myself,|something was bound to slip out!
{18457}{18555}I think it's very brave|what you said.
{18570}{18659}I can't sit here any more.|I have to walk places.
{18665}{18767}What's with the coat?|How about the animal rights thing?
{18773}{18832}I've been reading up,|and for your information...
{18838}{18919}...minks aren't very nice.
{18930}{18993}Okay, I admit it.|I love this coat, okay?
{18999}{19129}It's the best thing I ever had wrapped|around me, including Phil Huntley.
{19135}{19235}Remember Phil Huntley?|He was fine.
{19574}{19661}So you like the short hair better?
{19703}{19780}Yeti? Danny?
{19790}{19856}I had to cut my hair to get rid of...
{19862}{19917}...the fogger smell.
{19923}{20009}Listen, I'm so sorry.|I would have never fogged you...
{20015}{20102}...if you hadn't looked so...
{20108}{20198}Absolutely. Some people|are just into appearances.
{20204}{20224}What?
{20230}{20274}It's cool.
{20280}{20322}No, that is not cool.
{20328}{20363}You don't even know me.
{20369}{20458}You got the shopping bags|and the Saks catalogue.
{20464}{20544}From that, you've got me|all figured out?
{20550}{20578}Well, you don't.
{20584}{20704}You know, I could have toys|for underprivileged kids in here.
{20710}{20741}Do you?
{20747}{20870}You know, if kids like to play|with capri pants.
{20920}{21007}Stop saying that.|I hate that!
{21289}{21335}I judged you.|I made a snap judgment.
{21341}{21443}But you did it too, and you're worse.|You're sticking to your judgement.
{21449}{21529}You can't even open your mind to see|you might be wrong.
{21535}{21591}What does that say about you?
{21597}{21681}That pizza place|across the street any good?
{21687}{21733}I'm hungry.|You want some pizza?
{21739}{21811}You can keep yelling.
{21872}{21970}Stop saying that.|I hate that.
{22091}{22126}Are you still mad?
{22132}{22192}Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.
{22198}{22264}You know what?|I'm not in the mood.
{22270}{22322}Look, Ross.
{22328}{22427}I feel really bad.|You're going through all this stuff...
{22433}{22484}...and I just acted like a jerk.
{22490}{22604}- We are so sorry.|- You're stepping on the song.
{22610}{22698}We were way out of line, all right?|We totally support you.
{22704}{22757}Whatever you decide,|whatever you do.
{22763}{22837}Now you're just taking lines|out of the song.
{22843}{22954}This is hard enough, okay?|I really need you guys right now.
{22960}{23059}Yes, exactly! And that's why...
{23065}{23210}Why don't you come over tonight,|and I'll make your favorite dinner.
{23268}{23309}Thanks, you guys.
{23315}{23349}Are you wearing fur?
{23355}{23403}Let's get some perspective, people.
{23409}{23525}It's not like I'm wearing|a seeing-eye dog coat!
{23567}{23694}You know, I think I kind of|understand why I lost it today.
{23700}{23736}You do, huh?
{23742}{23764}You see...
{23770}{23819}...I'm an actor, right?
{23825}{23922}So I got to keep my emotions|right at the surface.
{23928}{24037}I got a lot of balls in the air,|you know?
{24042}{24188}It's tough. Guys like me,|you wander around, you're alone.
{24194}{24273}What are you talking about?
{24279}{24355}I'm not sure.
{24375}{24416}Look at you!|Where have you been?
{24422}{24461}I went to have pizza.
{24467}{24514}With Danny.
{24520}{24543}What happened?
{24549}{24624}That yeti is one smooth talker.
{24630}{24697}I hope you're not full.|Dinner's almost ready.
{24703}{24777}I think I'll probably|just hang out in my room.
{24783}{24808}Why?
{24814}{24844}Come on, you guys!
{24850}{24981}If Emily knew I was having dinner|with you, she'd flip out.
{24998}{25064}It's okay.|I really don't mind.
{25070}{25137}Wait, wait. You know what?|Just stay.
{25143}{25189}Please.
{25195}{25289}It would mean a lot for me|if you stay.
{25293}{25314}Ross, I just...
{25320}{25440}Please, just have dinner with us!
{25442}{25478}Settle down.
{25484}{25543}All right. I'm sorry.
{25549}{25635}You see, Rach, I'm an actor.
{25713}{25816}Hey, look!|Ugly naked guy's back.
{25837}{25879}We haven't seen him in so long.
{25885}{26005}Oh, God! I really missed|that fat bastard.
{26067}{26097}This is so weird.
{26103}{26211}I realized this may be|the last time we hang out together.
{26217}{26300}It's almost as if he knew.
{26330}{26400}I'll get it.
{26483}{26555}Hi, Emily.
{26568}{26653}You tracked him down.|Hold on.
{26720}{26815}Yeah, we're just having dinner.
{26821}{26857}Sure, hold on.
{26863}{26938}She wants to say hi.
{26980}{27008}Hi, Emily!
{27014}{27048}Hello, everyone.
{27054}{27103}So who am I saying hello to?
{27109}{27176}Well, I don't know|about who's here...
{27182}{27308}...but I can tell you who's not here,|and that's Rachel!
{27321}{27455}{y:i}I should hope not.|{y:i}Ross knows better than that by now.
{27514}{27567}You know what?|Rachel is here.
{27573}{27609}{y:i}She's there?
{27615}{27700}Oh, yeah, there she is!
{27705}{27751}She's here.
{27757}{27836}Take me off speakerphone.
{27850}{27908}How could you do this to me?
{27914}{27983}I made my feelings about Rachel|perfectly clear.
{27989}{28087}I'm just having dinner|with my friends, okay?
{28093}{28170}- You can't keep away from her.|{y:i}- That's ridiculous.
{28176}{28276}I'm moving for you. I'm cutting|friends out of my life for you.
{28282}{28385}Please, get on the plane|and come to New York, okay?
{28391}{28447}{y:i}You're the only one|{y:i}I want to be with.
{28453}{28592}I'll feel better when I'm there.|I can know where you are all the time.
{28632}{28737}You can't know where I am|all the time.
{28745}{28868}This marriage will never work|if you don't trust me.
{28880}{28945}You're right.
{28987}{29065}Can you trust me?
{29258}{29314}I think it's going okay.
{29320}{29350}Looks like he's smiling.
{29356}{29439}How can you tell?|You can only see his back.
{29445}{29486}You can totally tell!
{29492}{29548}Here, look, watch me.
{29554}{29577}Smile.
{29583}{29626}Frown. Smile.
{29632}{29658}Frown.
{29664}{29727}Smile.
{30025}{30066}I guess that's it.
{30072}{30133}Why? What happened?
{30139}{30220}My marriage is over.
{30249}{30326}Look at you, you're shivering.
{30332}{30400}Here.
{30466}{30555}Honey, is there anything we can do?
{30634}{30740}You can help me|get my furniture back from Gunther.
{31195}{31288}Stop tormenting me!
{31288}{31389}This is mink, okay? They're mean,|and they hate squirrels.
{31395}{31504}Most of these probably|wanted to be coats.
{31523}{31564}Fine. No, I get it.
{31570}{31607}Here.
{31613}{31653}You take it.
{31659}{31752}Are you happy now?|I'm cold!
{134}{186}Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?
{192}{249}No, look.
{255}{298}That's a pig.
{304}{405}I know.|But look at the knobs on it!
{508}{556}Emily's cousin kicked me out.
{562}{588}- What?|- Why?
{594}{658}When you sublet|from your wife's cousin...
{664}{762}...then you divorce, sometimes|the cousin wants his apartment back.
{768}{803}Didn't you sign a lease?
{809}{905}Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
{925}{989}You can stay with us.
{995}{1014}Anything you need.
{1020}{1088}But you have to let us know|when you feel better...
{1094}{1174}...so we can make fun of your hair.
{1197}{1231}You got it.
{1237}{1348}Thanks, I really appreciate this.|I'm going to get packing again.
{1354}{1474}I've been moving around so much|that I feel like a nomad.
{1534}{1625}He thought you said gonad.
{1644}{1710}The One Where Ross Moves In
{2850}{2951}If every place were this clean,|it'd be tough making a living.
{2957}{2998}Oh, Larry!
{3004}{3064}Do health inspectors|work on commission?
{3070}{3117}No, bribes.
{3123}{3203}- It's okay to laugh?|- I was just kidding.
{3209}{3321}- I'll check the kitchen floor.|- Knock yourself out.
{3329}{3403}Yummy!
{3424}{3526}Yeah, I'd let him check out|my kitchen floor.
{3582}{3624}A ninety-eight.
{3630}{3693}I deducted two points|for not wearing your hat.
{3699}{3750}That is a Section 5 violation.
{3756}{3824}Now look, Larry, honey.
{3830}{3876}I wrote the book on Section 5.
{3882}{3941}You only need to wear it|in the kitchen.
{3947}{3968}Where's your hat?
{3974}{4049}In the kitchen. I'll get it.
{4060}{4116}There's the two points!
{4122}{4224}You should really read|that book you wrote.
{4366}{4483}You saw the hat in the kitchen and|knew she'd go in hatless to get it.
{4489}{4596}You could have your own|health inspector detective show.
{4602}{4630}I don't know about that.
{4636}{4716}But then I could be|your sidekick, Voonda.
{4722}{4800}Maybe I could ask Voonda|to dinner sometime?
{4806}{4857}She would love that...
{4863}{4975}...since you know|all the clean places to eat.
{4980}{5060}I'll call you.
{5150}{5235}He's so funny!
{5360}{5413}Thank you.
{5419}{5491}How's Ross doing|since all the Emily stuff?
{5497}{5529}He's not great.
{5535}{5606}But he's dealing with it.|Wait, you're not...
{5612}{5694}I can't get started|with all that Ross stuff again.
{5700}{5759}He'll be screwed up for a long time.
{5765}{5854}Besides, I don't go for guys|right after they get divorced.
{5860}{6000}Right, you only go for them|five minutes before they get married.
{6063}{6137}- Two pounds of mocha java.|- It's Danny.
{6143}{6170}Are you going to go out again?
{6176}{6243}I don't know.|He hasn't called since we went out.
{6249}{6344}I see him in the hallway.|We flirt. I'm all...
{6350}{6425}...and then nothing.
{6453}{6483}Wow, thirsty.
{6489}{6578}I'm having a party on Saturday.|Sort of a housewarming thing.
{6584}{6613}- Fun.|- Great!
{6619}{6654}I'm looking forward to it.
{6660}{6725}See you!
{6809}{6910}So I guess we won't|be warming his house.
{6940}{7000}All right, I see what he's doing.
{7006}{7105}He's not asking me out|because he wants me to ask him out.
{7111}{7135}And you won't do that.
{7141}{7174}That's right!
{7180}{7253}Because that would give him|the control.
{7259}{7334}So now he comes up with this|"I've got a party" thing...
{7340}{7403}...to get me to hint|for an invitation.
{7409}{7484}Blew up in his face, didn't it?
{7490}{7549}So there is no party?
{7555}{7626}No, there's a party.|There's a party.
{7632}{7666}But the power?
{7672}{7727}That is still up for grabs.
{7733}{7776}You follow me?
{7782}{7812}I think so.
{7818}{7920}So he won't invite you to his party|because he likes you?
{7926}{7983}Exactly!
{8217}{8293}Hey, roomies!
{8310}{8358}I love what you've done|with the place.
{8364}{8408}I know it's a lot of boxes.
{8414}{8508}- I appreciate you letting me stay here.|- Not a problem.
{8514}{8563}Since you'll be here a while...
{8569}{8643}...we could put your name|on the answering machine.
{8649}{8691}I hope you don't mind...
{8697}{8791}...but I kind of already|jazzed it up a little.
{8797}{8865}Check it out.
{8962}{8989}{y:i}We will
{8995}{9089}{y:i}We will call you back
{9129}{9201}Pretty cool.
{9237}{9355}- You're fake laughing too, right?|- The tears are real.
{9404}{9472}You look beautiful this evening.
{9478}{9548}Show me the badge again.
{9650}{9695}Shiny.
{9701}{9797}You mind if I wash up?|Who knows where these have been?
{9803}{9890}You are just nonstop!
{10115}{10155}- We're out of here.|- Why?
{10161}{10253}I saw ten violations.|I'm shutting this place down!
{10259}{10368}- You have the power to do that?|- This does.
{10374}{10443}Shut it down.
{10760}{10802}What are you doing?
{10808}{10875}Nothing.
{10880}{10965}You built a fort, didn't you?
{10980}{11014}Kind of.
{11020}{11103}Oh, my God! The air purifier.|Ross' air purifier.
{11109}{11225}All I heard for four years|through college was...
{11240}{11302}You should have gone out|once in a while.
{11308}{11369}- I hate this thing!|- Come on, Chandler.
{11375}{11438}Ross is our friend.|He needs us right now.
{11444}{11580}So why don't you be a grownup|and come watch TV in the fort?
{11689}{11749}I wanted to invite you to the party.
{11755}{11805}Thanks, I'll try to stop by.
{11811}{11887}Actually, I think|I'm going to be busy.
{11893}{11950}You are?
{11963}{12054}Remember, I've got that gala?
{12074}{12138}What's the gala for?
{12144}{12214}It's a regatta gala.
{12220}{12249}Do you sail?
{12255}{12346}No, but I support it.
{12354}{12475}I hope I see you tomorrow night.|Take care.
{12530}{12593}Walked right into that one,|didn't he?
{12599}{12629}What one?
{12635}{12699}You wanted him to invite you|and he did.
{12705}{12777}He waited until the last minute.|So if I said yes...
{12783}{12873}...he'd know I had nothing better|to do than wait for his invitation.
{12879}{12910}But I said no...
{12916}{12984}...which puts me back|in the driver's seat.
{12990}{13046}So the ball is in his court?
{13052}{13077}Ball?
{13083}{13165}No, there's no ball.
{13395}{13424}Joey, please.
{13430}{13495}Sorry.
{13870}{13921}Hello, children.
{13927}{14027}You want to play some foosball?|Please?
{14061}{14154}We moved the table into my room|because of all the boxes.
{14160}{14230}Come on!
{14335}{14378}I have one question.
{14384}{14468}What is the deal with this?
{14474}{14557}Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?
{14563}{14622}No, the quiet down thing.
{14628}{14699}You mean this.
{14740}{14795}I don't know how much more|I can take.
{14801}{14936}Did you know he taped over my "Baywatch"|tape with a show about bugs?
{14939}{14977}My God!
{14983}{15058}What if that had been porn?
{15064}{15108}All right, this may be tough...
{15114}{15184}...but it's Ross.|I survived college with him.
{15190}{15258}I guess I can hold out|a little longer.
{15264}{15340}Let's have a game.
{15469}{15527}Fellas?
{15655}{15730}So he's out of here.
{15878}{15975}Got anything to eat?|I went to Jono's and it was closed.
{15981}{16104}I took Larry there, but it was all|violated, so we shut it down.
{16110}{16208}If this guy keeps closing our|favorite places, where will we eat?
{16214}{16253}I don't know. Clean places?
{16259}{16327}Yum!
{16437}{16459}It's Danny.
{16465}{16536}Don't let him in!|I'm supposed to be at a gala.
{16542}{16617}We'll be right there.|Can't you say it's later?
{16623}{16701}What kind of a regatta gala|starts at night?
{16707}{16774}The fake kind.
{16845}{16962}- I need a ladle. You got a ladle?|- We have a ladle.
{16984}{17069}See you at the party.
{17070}{17205}You know what Larry would say?|He'd say, "See you ladle."
{17275}{17357}I'm done. You want anything?|Sports? International?
{17363}{17406}Apartment listings?
{17412}{17435}I'll take sports.
{17441}{17510}Mine!
{17515}{17551}All right, international.
{17557}{17620}That's mine too.
{17630}{17699}I'm Italian.
{17705}{17814}I could check apartment listings,|though there's never anything here.
{17820}{17910}Not even on page seven?
{17943}{18008}You're right.|Here's an affordable place.
{18014}{18117}Two bedroom, close to work.|It's available in five weeks.
{18123}{18198}What about that circled one?
{18204}{18282}It's kind of expensive for a studio.
{18288}{18328}But it's available now.
{18334}{18359}Isn't it?
{18365}{18401}Yes, it is.
{18407}{18490}Let's go look at it!
{18498}{18570}There we go!
{18585}{18712}Guys, would you chip in for some|new air filters for the purifier?
{18718}{18789}I mean, after all,|we are all using it.
{18795}{18856}Let's go quicker!
{19160}{19194}Oh, my God!
{19200}{19301}Look at this kitchen/bathroom.
{19307}{19388}That's great!|So you can cook while in the tub.
{19394}{19473}Somebody was using his head.
{19481}{19580}Let's check out|the rest of the place.
{19758}{19829}I think this is it.
{19835}{19903}I don't know.|Maybe we should keep looking.
{19909}{19969}But this place is available now.
{19975}{20085}You don't want to be stuck|with us for five weeks.
{20198}{20265}So you think I should|take this place?
{20271}{20346}It's perfect!
{20405}{20444}How about you?
{20450}{20545}Kitchen, slash, bathroom.
{20583}{20646}I see what you guys are saying.
{20652}{20757}I'll go downstairs|and fill out an application.
{20828}{20893}We are bad people.
{20899}{21000}He knew we were trying|to get rid of him.
{21038}{21140}Could we get a bathtub|in our kitchen?
{21208}{21240}Ready for dinner?
{21246}{21293}- Absolutely.|- Great.
{21299}{21350}You wanted to go to|the Italian place on Bleecker St.?
{21356}{21398}I love that place!
{21404}{21475}So, no.
{21475}{21534}How about Mama Lozetti's?
{21540}{21589}Sure.
{21595}{21671}How long has that milk|been sitting out?
{21677}{21731}No, this place is totally healthy.
{21737}{21797}This milk is mine.|I bought this today...
{21803}{21910}...because I was thirsty for milk,|you know?
{21975}{22050}Okay, let's go.
{22087}{22119}Hey, buddy.
{22125}{22245}Health Code 11 B requires that refuse|be taken out the back exit.
{22251}{22305}But then I have to go|all the way around.
{22311}{22383}So you choose convenience|over health?
{22389}{22454}Stop, Larry.
{22460}{22581}Can't you just be Larry and not|Larry the health inspector guy?
{22587}{22631}It was exciting at first.
{22637}{22761}But now, it's like, so where|are we going to eat ever?
{22767}{22836}I suppose I could give him a warning.
{22842}{22895}Thank you.
{22901}{22958}Go, go!
{23025}{23107}If, after dinner,|you still need to bust someone...
{23113}{23230}...I know a hot dog vendor|who picks his nose.
{23287}{23377}Maybe we did good,|helping Ross get back on his feet.
{23383}{23422}That was a nice place.
{23428}{23586}No closet space, but he could hang|his stuff out the window in a bag.
{23653}{23684}What do we do?
{23690}{23726}I don't know.
{23732}{23799}Maybe pizza?
{23805}{23885}About Ross!
{24070}{24159}It's the apartment manager.|Ross put us as references.
{24165}{24241}Ross is the greatest guy.|He's very reliable...
{24247}{24389}Of course, he has a big, huge dog|that barks into the night.
{24399}{24469}Well, who doesn't love dogs?
{24475}{24553}He's a tap dancer.
{24559}{24638}Yes, some would say|that is a lost art.
{24644}{24714}He's a pimp!
{24720}{24769}There you go. He's a pimp.
{24775}{24861}He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!
{25457}{25523}This is never going to work.|He's right there.
{25529}{25554}Just go say hi.
{25560}{25692}I have to go downstairs and back up,|as if I'm coming home from the gala.
{25698}{25820}So just go distract him.|But don't be sexy.
{25860}{25883}What's going on?
{25889}{25995}This is a great party.|Great food.
{26000}{26124}You know, most parties, it's all|chips and salsa, chips and salsa.
{26130}{26197}So...
{26211}{26250}What's this?
{26256}{26313}Salad.
{26350}{26404}And what's this?
{26410}{26459}Bread.
{26465}{26532}Aren't you a chef?
{26624}{26693}Right, tonight was your party.
{26699}{26750}You look great!|I'm glad you made it.
{26756}{26844}Well, you know,|the gala had to end sometime.
{26850}{26955}Don't go anywhere.|I'll be right back.
{26982}{27051}Whose court is the ball in now?
{27057}{27137}I thought there wasn't a ball.
{27143}{27249}Come on. He's glad I came.|He doesn't want me to go anywhere.
{27255}{27338}Ball's flying all over the place.
{27344}{27376}This is my friend, Tom.
{27382}{27445}This is the girl I told you about.
{27451}{27527}Come on!|You telling people about me?
{27533}{27605}I think you two|could really hit it off.
{27611}{27690}I'm gonna to go mingle.
{27693}{27835}So you work at Bloomingdale's?|My mom calls it "Bloomies".
{27973}{28046}At ease, soldier!
{28056}{28075}I'm sorry?
{28081}{28162}You can just drop the act.|I know what's going on.
{28168}{28216}You're Danny's wingman, right?
{28222}{28340}You guys are best buds, frat bros.
{28340}{28404}I'm going to go talk to a friend.
{28410}{28477}Yeah, you go talk to your friend.
{28483}{28568}Go tell him, "Nice try."
{28627}{28677}He just keeps lobbing them up...
{28683}{28800}...and I keep knocking them|right out of the park.
{28819}{28905}I think I need a drink.
{28978}{29017}Ninety-eight...
{29023}{29057}...ninety-nine...
{29063}{29108}...one hundred!
{29114}{29142}Okay. Go.
{29148}{29235}Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
{29293}{29372}Here we go, here we go.
{29412}{29523}So I didn't get that apartment.|Some problem with my application.
{29529}{29558}You're kidding?
{29564}{29663}But Phoebe said I could stay|at her place for a while, so...
{29669}{29750}Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.|We're roomies.
{29756}{29823}You don't need me|taking up all your space.
{29829}{29973}We got plenty of space.|There's still some by that speaker.
{29993}{30036}Please, just stay.
{30042}{30068}Are you sure?
{30074}{30185}- Definitely.|- You have to stay.
{30284}{30365}So I'm a pimp, huh?
{30392}{30436}It's okay.
{30442}{30496}Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.
{30502}{30589}But just talk to me.|Tell me if something bothers you.
{30595}{30755}And I'll do everything I can|to keep my annoying habits just...
{31113}{31194}Well, I see you've had|a very productive day.
{31200}{31246}The cowboy hat's a little much.
{31252}{31335}Come on, it's fun!
{31373}{31433}All right.
{31580}{31628}Isn't this a woman's hat?
{31634}{31750}Dude, stop talking crazy,|and make us some tea!
{203}{265}Monica, that was the best|Thanksgiving dinner ever.
{271}{370}It was so good.|I think you killed us.
{376}{433}I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
{439}{517}I need something sweet.
{523}{598}Does anyone want to watch TV?
{657}{705}Monica, your remote doesn't work.
{711}{810}You have to lift it and point.
{848}{919}Oh, forget it.
{928}{1061}Let's play that game where everyone|says one thing they're thankful for.
{1067}{1157}I am thankful for this|beautiful fall we've been having.
{1163}{1205}Very nice.
{1211}{1258}The other day,|I was at the bus stop...
{1264}{1410}...and this lovely fall breeze came|and blew this chick's skirt up.
{1419}{1549}Which reminds me,|I'm also thankful for thongs.
{1561}{1631}The One with the|Thanksgiving Flashbacks
{2743}{2848}It's not so much an underpant|as a feat of engineering.
{2854}{2875}It's amazing...
{2881}{2957}...how much they can do|with so little material.
{2963}{3083}And they play with your mind.|Is it there? Is it not there?
{3089}{3170}Are you aware that|you're still talking?
{3176}{3271}Is anyone thankful for anything else|besides a thong?
{3277}{3377}I don't know. Am I more thankful|for my divorce, or my eviction?
{3383}{3497}And I didn't think you'd be able|to come up with anything.
{3518}{3590}I'm sorry. This is|the worst Thanksgiving ever.
{3596}{3647}I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.
{3653}{3757}You can't swoop in with your bad|marriage and take that away from me.
{3763}{3890}You're not going to tell about your|parents' divorce again, are you?
{3900}{3984}Come on! I want to hear it.
{3991}{4099}It wouldn't be Thanksgiving|without Chandler bumming us out.
{4105}{4150}It's a tradition, like the parade.
{4156}{4299}If the parade decided it was gay|and abandoned its family.
{4336}{4367}Now, Chandler, dear...
{4373}{4424}Just because|we're getting a divorce...
{4430}{4481}...doesn't mean we don't love you.
{4487}{4512}It just means...
{4518}{4639}...he would rather sleep|with the houseboy than with me.
{4672}{4759}More turkey, Mr. Chandler?
{4825}{4923}You're right, yours is worse.|You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.
{4929}{4980}I've got one that's worse.
{4986}{5104}Really? Worse than,|"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"
{5121}{5177}The little rich boy|had a problem with the butler?
{5183}{5264}Yes, mine's worse!
{5364}{5395}More bandages!
{5401}{5447}More bandages!
{5453}{5517}Please, can I get|some more bandages in here?
{5523}{5604}This man is...
{5787}{5858}In this life, Phoebe.
{5864}{5896}This life?
{5902}{5970}Chandler's is worse.
{5978}{6037}It must be cool|remembering stuff like that.
{6043}{6111}I don't have any past life memories.
{6117}{6229}Of course, you don't, sweetie.|You're brand-new.
{6244}{6298}I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
{6304}{6366}Let's not tell this story.
{6372}{6396}I know!
{6402}{6531}It's the one where Joey got|Monica's turkey stuck on his head.
{6549}{6617}Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?
{6623}{6654}It's not like it sounds.
{6660}{6746}It's exactly like it sounds.
{7124}{7204}What's going on?
{7244}{7273}Oh, my God!
{7279}{7313}I know!
{7319}{7394}It's stuck!
{7394}{7418}Step.
{7424}{7460}How did it get on?
{7466}{7531}I put it on to scare Chandler.
{7537}{7618}Oh, my God! Monica's going to|totally freak out!
{7624}{7657}Help me get it off!
{7663}{7738}Plus, it smells really bad in here.
{7744}{7881}Of course it smells bad.|You have your head up a dead animal.
{8087}{8130}Did you get the turkey...?
{8136}{8179}Oh, my God!
{8185}{8215}Who is that?
{8221}{8283}It's Joey.
{8289}{8342}Is this supposed to be funny?
{8348}{8449}It's not supposed to be funny.|It's supposed to be scary.
{8455}{8481}Get that off now!
{8487}{8534}I can't. It's stuck!
{8540}{8662}It has to feed 20 people. They're|not going to eat it off your head!
{8668}{8687}Hold on.
{8693}{8780}Let's just all think.
{8877}{8928}I got it!
{8934}{8953}You pull.
{8959}{9069}I'll spread the legs|as wide as I can.
{9104}{9173}Now is not the time.
{9179}{9221}Count to three. One...
{9227}{9248}...two...
{9254}{9319}...three!
{9368}{9474}It worked!|I scared you! I knew it!
{9499}{9525}I'm here, big guy.
{9531}{9581}There you are!
{9587}{9660}I scared you!
{9709}{9786}You did look like an idiot.
{9792}{9866}I wasn't the only one|who looked like an idiot.
{9872}{9939}Remember when Ross tried to say|"butternut squash"...
{9945}{10058}...and it came out,|"squatternut bosh"?
{10079}{10159}Yeah, that's the same.
{10178}{10241}That's it.|That's my worst Thanksgiving.
{10247}{10296}That can't be the one Rachel meant.
{10302}{10358}She didn't even know that happened.
{10364}{10407}So what's yours?
{10413}{10472}I really don't want|to tell this story.
{10478}{10629}Reliving pain and getting depressed|is what Thanksgiving's all about.
{10629}{10658}For me, anyway.
{10664}{10732}And, of course, the Indians.
{10738}{10805}Of all people, you do not want me|to tell this story.
{10811}{10865}What is that supposed to mean?
{10871}{10927}Monica, I think Rachel's here!
{10933}{11004}I'll get it!
{11139}{11163}Happy Thanksgiving!
{11169}{11205}Not for me.
{11211}{11273}Chip and I broke up.
{11279}{11305}Why?
{11311}{11340}What happened?
{11346}{11430}My parents are out of town,|and Chip was going to come over.
{11436}{11487}And you were going to give him...
{11493}{11546}...your "flower".
{11552}{11597}Monica, can you just call it sex?
{11603}{11676}It really creeps me out|when you call it that.
{11682}{11710}And by the way...
{11716}{11846}...while we're at it, a guy's thing|is not called his "tenderness".
{11882}{11959}Believe me.
{12013}{12091}Happy Thanksgiving.
{12240}{12259}Everyone...
{12265}{12313}...this is Chandler.
{12319}{12343}My roommate...
{12349}{12449}...and lead singer of our band.
{12508}{12550}This is Monica.
{12556}{12635}I'm Ross' little sister.
{12706}{12753}I'm so glad you could come.
{12759}{12813}We've got plenty of food,|so I hope you're hungry.
{12819}{12942}Chandler hates Thanksgiving|and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
{12948}{13044}I'm so glad you brought him here.
{13074}{13142}I can make you some|macaroni and cheese for dinner.
{13148}{13230}As long as the Pilgrims|didn't eat it.
{13297}{13364}Damn it!
{13595}{13644}Does it feel weird around here now?
{13650}{13748}You know, since|I've been away at college?
{13754}{13803}Not really.
{13809}{13884}That's cool.
{14019}{14135}I cannot believe Chip dumped me|for that slut, Nancy Branson!
{14141}{14242}I am never going out with him again.|I don't care how much he begs.
{14248}{14358}His begging days are over, now|that he's with Nancy Branson.
{14382}{14436}I've just had it|with high school boys.
{14442}{14476}They're just silly.
{14482}{14559}They're just silly, stupid boys.
{14565}{14635}I'll start dating men.
{14659}{14681}I'm sorry, Judy.
{14687}{14811}I couldn't find that bowl|you and Jack were looking for.
{14834}{14928}Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.
{15226}{15264}Did you like|the macaroni and cheese?
{15270}{15355}It was great.|You should be a chef.
{15469}{15497}Guess what?
{15503}{15578}All this stuff about Nancy|being a slut was all a rumor.
{15584}{15663}Chip dumped her, and he wants|to come over to my house!
{15669}{15722}- That is so great!|- I know.
{15728}{15812}Oh, gosh. Listen,|if you and Chip do it tonight...
{15818}{15867}...promise me|you'll tell me everything?
{15873}{15964}Totally. It's not that big a deal.|We already kind of did it once.
{15970}{16048}But now you'll definitely know|whether or not you did it.
{16054}{16088}I know.
{16094}{16245}And Chip promised that this time|it'd last at least for an entire song.
{16273}{16323}I'm thinking of asking|Rachel out tonight.
{16329}{16392}Maybe playing her that song|we wrote last week.
{16398}{16489}"Emotional Knapsack"?|Right on!
{16508}{16595}But don't take long.|We're testing our fake I.D. S tonight.
{16601}{16682}Right, Clifford Alvarez?
{16689}{16771}Listen, Roland Cheng...
{16777}{16860}...if things go well,|I may be out with her all night.
{16866}{16907}Dude, don't do that to me.
{16913}{16971}It's cool, you can stay here.|My parents won't mind.
{16977}{17109}It's not that. I just don't want|to be stuck here with your fat sister.
{17168}{17217}Why don't you finish off these pies?
{17223}{17314}I don't have any more room|in the fridge.
{17374}{17422}No, thank you.
{17428}{17458}Judy, you did it.
{17464}{17546}She's finally full!
{17604}{17639}I called you fat?
{17645}{17706}- I don't even remember that.|- Well, I do.
{17712}{17755}I'm so sorry. I really am.
{17761}{17793}I was an idiot back then.
{17799}{17903}I rushed the stage at a Wham concert,|for crying out loud!
{17925}{17965}I can't believe you called her fat.
{17971}{18079}I can't believe you let|George Michael slap you.
{18088}{18114}I am really sorry.
{18120}{18196}That is terrible. I'm so sorry.
{18202}{18267}That's not the Thanksgiving|I was talking about.
{18273}{18294}Yes, it was.
{18300}{18337}No, it was actually...
{18343}{18456}Thanksgiving's over.|Let's get ready for Christmas.
{18473}{18528}I have the cutest Christmas story.
{18534}{18577}We want to hear Monica's story.
{18583}{18719}Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half.|But, whatever.
{18725}{18810}You changed your major again?
{18816}{18835}I had to.
{18841}{18954}There was never any parking|by the psychology building.
{18989}{19055}Love your new nose!
{19061}{19112}Dr. Wolfson's an artist.
{19118}{19151}He removed my mole cluster.
{19157}{19224}Want to see?
{19224}{19299}No! Please, let me.
{19480}{19545}Happy Thanksgiving.
{19551}{19594}Your hair sure is different.
{19600}{19641}We were just talking about that.
{19647}{19744}We can't believe|how stupid we used to look.
{19807}{19827}Where's Monica?
{19833}{19871}She's upstairs.
{19877}{19918}Come down, everyone's here!
{19924}{19948}Ross, Rachel...
{19954}{20054}...and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
{20148}{20195}Oh, my God!
{20201}{20238}What's the matter?
{20244}{20339}Is there something on my dress?
{20355}{20390}You look so different.
{20396}{20416}Terrific.
{20422}{20460}That dress, that body...
{20466}{20533}- Dude!|- Sorry.
{20544}{20590}Yes, she's thin. It's wonderful.
{20596}{20633}But we really want to hear...
{20639}{20729}...about Ross' new girlfriend.
{20760}{20790}Her name is Carol.
{20796}{20843}She's really pretty and smart.
{20849}{20921}She's on the lacrosse team|and the golf team.
{20927}{20963}Can you believe it?
{20969}{21057}She plays for both teams.
{21088}{21184}So I guess I'll see you at dinner.
{21194}{21255}- Dude!|- Sorry.
{21268}{21293}Oh, my God!
{21299}{21337}That was so awesome.
{21343}{21391}You got him back|for calling you fat.
{21397}{21438}He was drooling all over you.
{21444}{21543}- That must have felt so great.|- It didn't.
{21554}{21602}Yeah, I mean, I look great.
{21608}{21728}I feel great, and my heart's|not in trouble anymore.
{21734}{21795}I just don't feel|like I got him back.
{21801}{21848}I just want to humiliate him.
{21854}{21991}I want him to be naked, and|I want to point at him and laugh.
{21999}{22086}That, we may be able to do.
{22092}{22115}How?
{22121}{22212}Guys tend to get naked|before they're going to have sex.
{22218}{22237}What?
{22243}{22302}I didn't work this hard|and lose weight...
{22308}{22395}...just so I could give my flower|to someone like him.
{22401}{22486}If you keep calling it that,|no one will take it.
{22492}{22512}And then...
{22518}{22577}...you're not going|to have sex with him.
{22583}{22675}You'll just make him|think that you are.
{22714}{22787}I'll throw him out|in the yard, lock the door...
{22793}{22867}...and all our neighbors|will just humiliate him!
{22873}{22920}You'll definitely get him back.
{22926}{22982}How do I make him think|I want to have sex?
{22988}{23028}Here's what you do.
{23034}{23168}Just act like everything around you|turns you on.
{23202}{23232}What do you mean?
{23238}{23309}Anything can be sexy.
{23321}{23398}Like this dish towel.
{23451}{23528}This feels so good against my cheek.
{23534}{23641}And if I get a little hot,|I can just dab myself with it.
{23647}{23730}Or I can bring it down to my side|and run it through my fingers...
{23736}{23778}...while I talk to him.
{23784}{23807}I can do that.
{23813}{23843}Good, good, good.
{23849}{23908}Get busy. He's coming.
{23914}{23984}Hey, what's up?
{24018}{24130}Could you make me some of that|righteous mac and cheese like last year?
{24136}{24193}I'd love to.
{24338}{24429}I love macaroni and cheese.
{24444}{24561}I love the way this box feels|against my cheek.
{24703}{24786}And I love carrots.
{24841}{24949}Sometimes I like to put them|between my fingers.
{24959}{24995}Like this.
{25001}{25099}And hold them down here|while I talk to you.
{25182}{25262}And, you know, if I get really hot...
{25268}{25375}...I like to pick up this knife.
{25390}{25468}And I put the cool steel...
{25474}{25527}...against...
{25533}{25609}...my body.
{25621}{25685}Are you all right?
{25686}{25743}I'm fine.
{26076}{26111}Twenty-year-old male.
{26117}{26213}He's got a severed toe|on his right foot.
{26239}{26289}Could you please not|do that feet first?
{26295}{26413}You know where his injury is.|Severed toe, you just said it!
{26415}{26471}It says the knife went|through your shoe.
{26477}{26546}They're made of wicker!
{26556}{26587}Did you bring the toe?
{26593}{26659}I have it right here on ice.
{26665}{26747}Don't worry, son.|We'll just reattach it and then...
{26753}{26778}What is it?
{26784}{26855}You brought a carrot.
{26893}{26991}This isn't your toe. This is a small,|very cold piece of carrot.
{26997}{27045}You brought a carrot?
{27051}{27090}Oh, my God!
{27096}{27183}There's a toe in my kitchen.
{27196}{27235}I'm sorry! I'll go get it!
{27241}{27287}All we can do now|is sew up the wound.
{27293}{27347}Without my toe? I need my toe!
{27353}{27432}I can go really fast!|Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.
{27438}{27529}I'm not falling for that one.
{27531}{27638}That's why I lost my toe?|Because I called you fat?
{27654}{27714}I didn't mean to cut it off.|It was an accident.
{27720}{27828}That's why for an entire year|people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?
{27834}{27891}I'm sorry.
{27897}{27930}It wasn't your whole toe.
{27936}{27984}Yeah, well, I miss the tip.
{27990}{28056}It's the best part.
{28056}{28123}It has the nail.
{28219}{28247}Sir Limps-a-lot.
{28253}{28334}I came up with that.
{28361}{28434}You're a dork.
{28434}{28510}- I can't believe this.|- I said I was sorry.
{28516}{28628}"Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggy|that cried all the way home.
{28645}{28721}I hate this stupid day|and everything about it!
{28727}{28747}I'll see you later.
{28753}{28775}Wait.
{28781}{28813}Come here.
{28819}{28897}Is there anything I can do?|Anything?
{28903}{29011}Just leave me alone for a little while.
{29126}{29167}I'm a duck.|I go quack-quack.
{29173}{29259}I'm happy all the time.
{29492}{29518}Nice try.
{29524}{29599}Wait, wait, wait.
{29640}{29705}Look, Monica...
{29776}{29810}This is not going to work.
{29816}{29894}I bet this will work.
{30060}{30080}You're so great.
{30086}{30159}I love you.
{30393}{30523}Nothing. I said you're so great,|and then I just stopped talking.
{30527}{30580}You said you loved me.|I can't believe this!
{30586}{30649}No, I didn't!
{30656}{30680}Yes, you did!
{30686}{30730}No, I didn't!
{30736}{30772}You love me!
{30778}{30802}No, I don't!
{30808}{30886}Stop it, stop it, stop it!
{31155}{31190}Gauze!
{31196}{31215}Gauze!
{31221}{31273}I need to get some gauze in here!
{31279}{31399}Can I please get some more gauze?
{31603}{31686}This is getting ridiculous.
{132}{222}- What are you doing?|- I reorganized the fridge.
{228}{319}See? Bottom shelf,|meats and dairy.
{325}{396}Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.
{402}{509}And top shelf, expired products.
{515}{543}Why are you doing this?
{549}{601}Because I'm bored out of my mind.
{607}{698}I've already been to the bank,|post office and dry cleaners.
{704}{790}Dude, you just described|seven days worth of stuff.
{796}{880}Spread it out a little.|Haven't you ever been unemployed?
{886}{941}I'm not unemployed.|I'm on sabbatical.
{947}{1027}Hey, don't get religious|on me, okay?
{1033}{1127}A guy in your position needs to be|better at relaxing.
{1133}{1253}That's why we have comfortable chairs.|Here, sit down.
{1272}{1336}Ready? Watch.
{1353}{1428}And then...
{1448}{1499}- So, what? We just sit?|- Oh, no, no.
{1505}{1618}We're not going to just sit.|Watch.
{1656}{1736}{y:i}- Hello, Chandler Bing.|- Hello, Mr. Bing.
{1742}{1797}I love you!
{1803}{1908}{y:i}All right, whoever this is,|{y:i}stop calling me!
{1918}{1990}{y:i}It's been 6 months!|{y:i}It's not funny!
{1996}{2042}But I love you!
{2048}{2131}{y:i}Leave me alone!|{y:i}For the love of God, leave me alone!
{2137}{2217}And that's Wednesday.
{2235}{2304}The One with|The Inappropriate Sister
{3402}{3498}Hey, you guys! Guess what?
{3530}{3599}The British are coming?
{3606}{3689}Oh, you and your ways.
{3698}{3800}Since it's Christmas,|I'm going to be collecting donations.
{3806}{3916}I have my bell,|and later on I get my bucket.
{3928}{3978}I'll be spreading joy|to the people.
{3984}{4054}Last year I spread a little joy,|but not enough.
{4060}{4160}So this year, I'm doing|the whole city.
{4162}{4272}I knew a girl in high school who|did that. She was very popular.
{4278}{4354}So, Pheebs, where are you|doing your bell ringing?
{4360}{4422}They gave me a great spot|right by Macy's.
{4428}{4485}They never give a good spot|to a rookie...
{4491}{4605}...but I'm the only one who can say|"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.
{4611}{4666}I lied!
{4672}{4720}Oh, my God. Here's Danny.
{4726}{4808}Just watch this.
{4837}{4962}See? Still pretending|he's not interested.
{4982}{5052}He's coming over.|Pretend we've forgotten who he is.
{5058}{5129}- Hey, guys.|- Hey, Danny.
{5148}{5227}Oh, Danny! Hey!
{5233}{5342}You know Rachel. She's nice.|She's not bad to look at, right?
{5348}{5386}Thanks, Mon.
{5392}{5422}Of course.
{5428}{5519}Do you want to go out|on a date with her?
{5525}{5618}Absolutely. Is Friday okay?
{5625}{5687}Friday is perfect.|She can't wait.
{5693}{5787}On the date, I'll be able|to talk to her directly?
{5793}{5856}See you Friday.
{5858}{5949}Okay, what the hell was that?|You know what? Don't answer me.
{5955}{6038}I have a date with Danny!
{6093}{6137}How could I not get the part?
{6143}{6233}The play was about a 29-year-old|Italian actor from Queens!
{6239}{6311}Well, Talia Shire|suddenly became available.
{6317}{6367}She's a woman!
{6373}{6478}What can I say? She nailed it!
{6506}{6545}Is there anything else?
{6551}{6606}You'll just say no again, but...
{6612}{6685}...gay porn?
{6718}{6752}Happy Holidays!
{6758}{6819}"Feliz Navidad"!
{6825}{6880}"Allo" and Merry Christmas!
{6886}{6985}Oh, thank you, sir!|Here's some joy.
{7018}{7068}- How's it going?|- It's going okay.
{7074}{7119}Good. Let me help you out.
{7125}{7191}Oh, thanks!
{7225}{7336}Is that a new suede jacket?|It looks really expensive.
{7342}{7441}Yeah. I guess.
{7449}{7512}Just get your nails done?
{7518}{7589}Yes, Phoebe, but this|is all I have, okay?
{7595}{7680}Thanks. Happy Holidays!|Here's your joy.
{7686}{7748}Thank you! Happy Holidays and...|Wait.
{7754}{7840}- You can't take money out.|- I'm making change for the bus.
{7846}{7907}Can't you leave the|dollar for the poor?
{7913}{7979}I'm poor.|I got to take the bus.
{7985}{8040}Okay. Seasons Greetings!|But still...
{8046}{8112}Bite me, blondie!
{8149}{8283}I'm going to give him|something besides joy. Just...
{8344}{8417}I can't believe|I didn't get that part.
{8423}{8479}I'm sorry, man.
{8485}{8521}What you should do...
{8527}{8587}...is make something happen|for yourself.
{8593}{8647}You know, like write a play.
{8653}{8737}Or a movie. What about those|"Good Will Hunting" guys?
{8743}{8832}Be realistic, you know?|If I did write something...
{8838}{8963}...what are the chances I could|get those guys to star in it?
{9000}{9049}Wait a second.|I could star in it!
{9055}{9116}Or that.
{9126}{9198}I can't write.|I mean, I'm an actor.
{9204}{9306}I don't have the discipline|that it takes. I can't do it.
{9312}{9336}I'll help you.
{9342}{9440}Yeah. I'll make up a schedule|and make sure you stick to it.
{9446}{9500}Plus it'll give me|something to do.
{9506}{9560}You'd do that for me?|Thanks.
{9566}{9647}We'll start slow. All you have|to come up with tonight...
{9653}{9721}...is the name|of your main character.
{9727}{9769}- Done.|- And it can't be Joey.
{9775}{9814}- It's not.|- Or Joseph.
{9820}{9877}Oh.
{9986}{10009}What's up?
{10015}{10086}I just saw Danny on the subway|with a girl...
{10092}{10142}...and he had his arm|around her.
{10148}{10174}Honey, I'm sorry.
{10180}{10273}You should be.|This is all your fault.
{10275}{10344}You meddled in our relationship!
{10350}{10391}You had no relationship!
{10397}{10455}But I was doing my thing,|and everything...
{10461}{10511}...was going according to the plan!
{10517}{10619}Oh, God stop with the plan!
{10625}{10675}So what if you saw him|with a girl?
{10681}{10725}That doesn't mean anything.
{10731}{10839}You'll go out with Danny and be|so charming he'll forget all about...
{10845}{10896}...that stupid subway girl.
{10902}{10966}She was kind of stupid.
{10972}{11052}You're right.|I'm just going to go on the date.
{11058}{11198}I'm just going to go on the date.|That is the new plan.
{11208}{11273}Hurry!
{11597}{11679}- How do you spell "suspicious"?|- Why?
{11685}{11812}I think this character is going|to be suspicious about stuff.
{11867}{11965}Chandler Bing, seven!|Chandler Bing, zero!
{11971}{12010}You're driving me crazy.
{12016}{12057}- I'll stop.|- Don't stop.
{12063}{12188}Move the bowl further away.|Ross could make that shot.
{12283}{12379}You suck. But at least you suck|at a man's game now.
{12385}{12438}- Want to play?|- I can't play games.
{12444}{12547}Ross'll be home soon. I have to write|5 pages to stick to his schedule.
{12553}{12651}So play for 30 minutes,|then write until he gets home.
{12657}{12706}All right.
{12712}{12776}But listen, what do you say we...
{12782}{12827}...crank it up a notch?
{12833}{12870}I'm intrigued.
{12876}{12948}All right. All we need|is a little lighter fluid.
{12954}{13028}But be careful.|I want our security deposit back.
{13034}{13138}We said goodbye to that|when we invented hammer darts.
{13144}{13273}Do you even remember which part|of the wall is not spackle?
{13333}{13416}Thank you! Happy Holiday.
{13458}{13532}No, that's trash, young lady.|You can't...
{13538}{13652}Stop that young lady!|She donated trash!
{13713}{13760}The charity's on fire!
{13766}{13852}Help!|Thank you. I need that!
{13858}{13892}What is this?
{13898}{13986}It's nine o'clock in the morning!
{13992}{14051}All right. "A room."
{14057}{14156}"A man enters. He looks suspicious."
{14233}{14290}That's it?
{14293}{14365}You're supposed to|have five pages done by now...
{14371}{14461}...including an exciting incident.
{14473}{14604}What is all this?|"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."
{14610}{14650}That's the game we played.
{14656}{14798}It's great. You take a|tennis ball, a bowl and lighter...
{14831}{14913}This is helping your career?|You wanted to be an actor.
{14919}{14997}Not the creator of|"Crazy Lawsuit Game".
{15003}{15055}You're right.|I'll get back to work.
{15061}{15147}Shame on you! You should know better!|Joey needs to work.
{15153}{15212}Now come on.
{15233}{15348}You can have this|when the 5 pages are done.
{15597}{15662}- I had a nice time tonight.|- So did I.
{15668}{15773}I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
{15950}{16021}I'd love to ask you in|but my sister's visiting.
{16027}{16107}- I think she's asleep on the couch.|- Your sister?
{16113}{16172}Your sister's asleep on the couch?
{16178}{16326}I saw you with her on the subway|and now she's asleep on the couch!
{16332}{16402}- I thought I heard you.|- Hey, great, you're up.
{16408}{16457}Rachel, my sister Krista.
{16463}{16492}Nice to meet you.
{16498}{16567}I wish you'd warned me.|I'd have fixed myself up.
{16573}{16640}- Like it would help.|- You are so bad.
{16646}{16672}- You are.|- You are.
{16678}{16736}- You are.|- You are!
{16742}{16776}You are so dead!
{16782}{16871}I'm going to get you.|Come here!
{17050}{17138}It's very nice to meet you.
{17188}{17265}Nobody!|Nobody respects the bucket!
{17271}{17346}You wouldn't believe|what people put in here!
{17352}{17425}Does this look like a|garbage can to you?
{17431}{17484}Does it look like an ashtray?
{17490}{17578}Does it look like a urinal?
{17585}{17689}- So you going back out there?|- Yeah, but I won't take anymore crap.
{17695}{17790}No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
{17796}{17861}Good. You're tough.|You lived on the street.
{17867}{17952}I'll go back to being|Street Phoebe.
{17958}{18117}But not totally back. Street Phoebe|wouldn't be friends with you guys.
{18168}{18227}Can I ask you guys something?
{18233}{18346}I don't have brothers so I don't know,|but did you guys wrestle?
{18352}{18391}- Oh, yeah.|- All the time.
{18397}{18484}In fact, I was undefeated.
{18490}{18583}Well, you weighed 200 pounds.
{18593}{18667}Still, I was quick as a cat.
{18673}{18727}I met Danny's sister yesterday.
{18733}{18811}- That was the girl on the subway.|- You're kidding.
{18817}{18875}They were very, you know...
{18881}{18917}...wrestle-y.
{18923}{18976}But I guess that's normal?
{18982}{19063}We don't wrestle now.
{19081}{19161}Not since I got too|strong for you.
{19167}{19216}Too strong for me?
{19222}{19274}You want to go right now?
{19280}{19385}I'll take you right now, buddy!|You want to go?
{19391}{19452}Oh, fine.
{19471}{19512}Ready?
{19518}{19587}Wrestle!
{19663}{19697}Okay, you know what?
{19703}{19802}Actually, that helps a lot.|Thanks.
{19884}{19959}Let's go!|The puck drops in 20 minutes!
{19965}{19996}Joey's not going.
{20002}{20080}I didn't finish my 5 pages.
{20086}{20127}Finish them tomorrow.
{20133}{20195}Tomorrow he's redoing|yesterday's pages.
{20201}{20292}Yesterday's pages|did not reflect my best work.
{20298}{20392}Cut him some slack. If he relaxes,|he'll get some work done.
{20398}{20482}I think he's been relaxing enough,|thanks to you...
{20488}{20549}...and Fireball.
{20555}{20655}If you think Fireball's relaxing,|you've never played.
{20661}{20722}You're doing this|because you're bored.
{20728}{20779}It's not his fault|you're unemployed.
{20785}{20867}I am not unemployed.|I'm on sabbatical!
{20873}{20911}Guys, don't fight.
{20917}{20999}And I'm doing this because|I am Joey's friend.
{21005}{21076}If you were a friend,|you'd be doing the same.
{21082}{21134}So being a friend means|being a jerk?
{21140}{21222}If it does, then you're|an amazing friend of mine.
{21228}{21288}Let's settle this|over a game of Fireball.
{21294}{21405}- I'll unhook the smoke detectors.|- Let's settle this right now.
{21411}{21509}There. Now no one's going|to the game.
{21515}{21605}- I paid for those!|- You said you would, but you didn't.
{21611}{21669}Oh, yeah.
{21805}{21870}We finally get|to the top of the mountain...
{21876}{21946}...and airhead here|forgets the camera.
{21952}{22050}The same thing|happened to me one time.
{22056}{22132}When did that happen to you?
{22138}{22210}Remember? We were jogging|and saw that bird.
{22216}{22296}I wanted to take a picture|but I didn't have my camera.
{22302}{22406}Chasing the churro|guy is not jogging.
{22408}{22523}Oh, this is so good.|You have got to try it.
{22752}{22883}- Damn. I got it on my pants.|- Here, I'll get it.
{23047}{23098}We better take them off|or the stain will set.
{23104}{23203}- I want to wear them tonight.|- Oh, great.
{23209}{23294}Okay, bye. Oh, my God!
{23298}{23361}- That was unbelievable.|- See? I told you.
{23367}{23398}Yeah, wow. Sorry.
{23404}{23446}I don't believe they're|brother and sister.
{23452}{23538}They're brother and sister?!
{23793}{23882}Wait a minute. Open your hand.|Let me take a look.
{23888}{23985}Quarter, dime. Lint?|Not interested in that.
{23991}{24042}What's this?|A Canadian coin?
{24048}{24133}Get out of here!
{24173}{24224}Whoa!|No drinks near the bucket.
{24230}{24324}Set it down there and then|you can make a contribution.
{24330}{24424}You can leave the "hurt bunny"|look over there too.
{24430}{24452}Hi, Bob.
{24458}{24558}I thought I told you|to get out of here!
{24572}{24631}Phoebe, we've been|getting complaints.
{24637}{24726}We're moving you to a|less high-profile spot.
{24732}{24852}- Ginger's taking this corner.|- That chick can't handle my corner.
{24858}{24930}Look, either you leave|or we remove you.
{24936}{24998}Fine.
{25118}{25243}I'll give you one pointer.|Look out for that bitch.
{25440}{25554}- I thought we said seven.|- You know what? Let's skip it.
{25560}{25612}What? Why?
{25618}{25710}You and your sister seem to have|a very special bond...
{25716}{25840}Oh, great.|That "special bond" again.
{25841}{25939}Why do women have a problem|with my being close to my sister?
{25945}{26031}- I don't know, but...|- Do you have brothers?
{26037}{26164}No, I have two sisters. But one|has a very masculine energy.
{26170}{26292}- Are you close?|- No. They're not very nice people.
{26321}{26390}I like you.|I think this could go somewhere.
{26396}{26492}So I'm close to my family.|Don't let it stand in our way.
{26498}{26559}Well, I don't know...
{26565}{26612}When you put it that way...
{26618}{26739}Danny? Hurry up.|The bath's getting cold.
{26803}{26872}I'll see you later.
{26948}{27017}There's some kids|playing in the street.
{27023}{27107}Want to go give them a project,|ruin their day?
{27113}{27195}If they have a ball,|you could stick razors in it...
{27201}{27312}...and teach them a new game:|"Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."
{27318}{27436}Hey, guys! I was at the library.|I already finished my 5 pages.
{27442}{27551}Now we can go|to the Ranger game... last night!
{27557}{27670}No, dude.|Ross tore up the tickets.
{27741}{27853}I guess without so many distractions|it's easier for you to focus, huh?
{27859}{28018}Also without somebody breathing|down your neck all the livelong day!
{28018}{28129}The important thing is I finished it.|And I think it's really good.
{28135}{28249}But it would help if I could hear it.|Would you guys read it for me?
{28255}{28329}- Yeah, all right.|- All right.
{28371}{28427}"It's a typical New York apartment."
{28433}{28540}"Two guys are hanging out."
{28583}{28624}"Hey, man."
{28630}{28705}"What is up?"
{28706}{28797}"About yesterday.|I was really wrong. I am sorry."
{28803}{28885}"No, it was me. I'm sorry.|I overreacted."
{28891}{29033}"Maybe it was both of us.|But we had our best friend's inter...
{29066}{29174}But we had our best friend's|interest at heart."
{29180}{29270}"Could I be more sorry?"
{29366}{29449}"I don't know. I am one sorry...
{29455}{29546}...polontologist."
{29606}{29667}All right, Joey, we get it.
{29673}{29722}- I'm sorry.|- I'm sorry too.
{29728}{29834}Keep reading.|The good part's coming up.
{29858}{29930}"I am sorry, Chandler."
{29936}{30026}"I am sorry, Ross."
{30038}{30133}"A handsome man enters."
{30175}{30294}"I don't know what you're talking|about, but I'd like to thank you both."
{30300}{30362}"You. You wouldn't let me|give up on myself."
{30368}{30400}"And you."
{30406}{30490}"You co-created Fireball."
{30501}{30562}"The End."
{30568}{30642}This took you all day?
{30648}{30694}No, this took five minutes.
{30700}{30853}I spent the rest of the day coming up|with New Ultimate Fireball!
{30951}{31004}"It's a typical|New York apartment."
{31010}{31101}"Two girls are just|hanging out. " Go.
{31107}{31194}- "Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"|- "I'm doing just fine."
{31200}{31303}"God, Tiffany, you smell so great."
{31318}{31352}"It's my new perfume."
{31358}{31501}"Why don't you come closer where|you can really appreciate it."
{31525}{31586}- Joey, you are sick.|- This is disgusting.
{31592}{31637}I'm not reading this.
{31643}{31778}Wait, wait, wait!|The handsome man was about to enter!
{62}{95}Come on, Joey!
{101}{157}I told you everything I knew|last night.
{163}{250}It's not that big a deal.|So they're doing it.
{256}{319}I cannot believe you would say that!
{325}{435}Sorry. Monica and Chandler|are making love.
{441}{528}No, I mean, come on.|This is a huge deal!
{534}{615}I need more details.|Who initiated the first kiss?
{621}{678}I don't know.
{685}{740}Is he romantic with her?
{746}{803}I don't know.
{818}{866}Are they in love?
{872}{929}I don't know.
{936}{971}You don't know anything.
{977}{1016}I know one thing.
{1022}{1089}They did it right there.
{1109}{1180}The One with Chandler's Work Laugh
{2360}{2413}Could I have a scone?
{2419}{2456}Want to hear some good news?
{2462}{2510}Someone I know is getting married.
{2516}{2638}Weddings are happy occasions.|Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!
{2649}{2670}Sorry, man.
{2676}{2756}- Here's your scone.|- Thanks.
{2791}{2891}Stupid British snack food!
{2897}{2995}Did they teach you that|in anger management?
{2998}{3064}You know what might|help you deal with it?
{3070}{3150}You two are in the past.|You can't be mad about the past.
{3156}{3286}Are you still mad about, you know,|the Louisiana Purchase?
{3295}{3329}Nobody's mad about that.
{3335}{3436}Exactly!|Because it's in the past.
{3476}{3556}Anybody going to eat that?
{3621}{3711}Look at us all dressed up for the party.|What are we celebrating?
{3717}{3800}We had a lot of liquor|left over from Christmas.
{3806}{3919}Our friends aren't here. We can be|a real couple. We don't have to hide.
{3925}{3990}I know. I can do this.
{3996}{4071}And I can do this.
{4076}{4137}We can't do that.
{4143}{4213}Hey, Bing!
{4219}{4330}Who's the pretty lady,|and what is she doing with you?
{4336}{4394}I asked myself|that very question, sir.
{4400}{4422}My boss, Doug.
{4428}{4466}- This is Monica.|- Hi.
{4472}{4571}- This is my wife, Kara.|- Nice to meet you.
{4606}{4673}Did you hear about the new law firm|working for us?
{4679}{4747}Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.
{4820}{4902}Let's go drink our body weight.
{4926}{4959}What was that?
{4965}{4990}That noise you made?
{4996}{5039}Oh, my work laugh.
{5045}{5067}Your work laugh?
{5073}{5174}If you're going to survive this party,|come up with one too.
{5180}{5253}All right. Check me out.
{5254}{5358}He says, "$30, Father.|Same as in town."
{5501}{5568}Everybody at work loved you last night.
{5574}{5645}And they like me more|just because I was with you.
{5651}{5758}You repaired the damage|from when they met Joey.
{5765}{5849}Doug wants to play tennis.|He never talks to me outside of work.
{5855}{5947}Except for that time|at that strip club.
{5969}{6044}Strip church.
{6059}{6125}- I'll go find a racket.|- I thought you had one.
{6131}{6229}I used to, but then Joey thought|it'd be fun to go hit rocks...
{6235}{6302}...at bigger rocks.
{6308}{6349}Do you have a tennis racket?
{6355}{6443}I lent it to Joey and|I've never gotten it back.
{6449}{6514}Good luck with that.
{6588}{6615}What's up?
{6621}{6681}Why are you here?|I thought you had inventory.
{6687}{6745}I do, but I decided I'd take|a long lunch...
{6751}{6835}...and spend some time|with my friend, Monica.
{6841}{6902}You know, I feel like|we don't talk anymore.
{6908}{6941}How are you?
{6947}{7021}What is new with you?
{7069}{7122}Not much. Work's good.
{7128}{7240}We don't have to talk about work.|Talk about anything.
{7276}{7327}You know what?
{7333}{7370}Let's talk about relationships.
{7376}{7407}What's going on?
{7413}{7469}Nothing.
{7475}{7524}You go.
{7530}{7610}There was this guy at the bank|that I thought was cute.
{7616}{7678}But I don't anymore.
{7684}{7747}That's juicy.
{7753}{7829}You know what? I actually do|have a lot of work to do.
{7835}{7919}You're sure there's just|not anything else?
{7925}{8006}I'm sure. Is there something|you want to talk to me about?
{8012}{8079}No!
{8150}{8237}If there was, I wouldn't tell you.
{8390}{8459}Then what happened?
{8575}{8623}You'll get your turn.
{8629}{8690}- Hey, Pheebs. What's going on?|- Nothing.
{8696}{8748}This is not over.
{8754}{8801}No, no, no!
{8807}{8889}I was up all night writing|this nasty letter to Emily.
{8895}{8963}It was perfect,|and now it's all covered in...
{8969}{9024}Actually, thanks!
{9030}{9095}All right!|Ready to go to the movies?
{9101}{9149}Actually, I think I'll skip it.
{9155}{9174}Really?
{9180}{9263}I'll read my book.|I just want to be alone right now.
{9269}{9300}Sure you don't want to?
{9306}{9440}Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.|They get mail and stuff.
{9446}{9479}That's okay, Joe.
{9485}{9560}Let's go, Pheebs.
{9904}{9972}Game!
{9978}{10091}I got to tell you, that partner|of yours is a real tiger.
{10097}{10171}Are you all right?
{10189}{10284}We'll just get|a little sip of water.
{10290}{10355}Am I on fire today or what?
{10361}{10475}Those birds are browned,|basted and ready to be carved.
{10481}{10560}Okay, easy, Martina.
{10565}{10625}I think we should let them|win the next game.
{10631}{10728}I'm sorry, I don't understand|what you just said.
{10734}{10759}Let them win one.
{10765}{10867}Are you crazy? We own those two.|Look at them!
{10873}{10965}He can't even breathe,|and she's popping pills.
{10971}{11010}You're not giving them a chance.
{11016}{11089}They have rackets.
{11136}{11179}We'll make this the last game.
{11185}{11231}Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.
{11237}{11295}Are you sure you never played pro?
{11301}{11328}Please let them win.
{11334}{11461}I'll take it down to 95%,|but that's the best I can do.
{11556}{11645}- Missed it!|- I got it!
{11701}{11762}Nice shot.
{11953}{12007}I got it!
{12013}{12088}Long!
{12206}{12259}I can't believe you let them win.
{12265}{12344}Well, at least you hid|your feelings well about it.
{12350}{12376}I was frustrated.
{12382}{12404}It's my racket.
{12410}{12440}Frustrated with you!
{12446}{12554}If we hadn't lost, they would never have|invited us to dinner tomorrow.
{12560}{12584}What bothers me...
{12590}{12649}...is how different|you act around them.
{12655}{12723}The throwing the tennis games,|the fake laugh...
{12729}{12851}...the "See you later, Bing!"|"Not if I see you first, Doug!"
{12884}{12963}I don't like "work Chandler".|The guy's a suck-up.
{12969}{13013}Because you said that...
{13019}{13101}...I'm not putting out tonight!
{13238}{13314}Something's wrong.|My brother doesn't stay out all night.
{13320}{13408}Maybe we should check|the trash chute.
{13410}{13465}Ross couldn't fit|down the trash chute.
{13471}{13525}That's right. He almost could.
{13531}{13627}Which is exactly|how I got stuck there.
{13665}{13715}Oh, my God!
{13721}{13775}Where the hell have you been?
{13781}{13834}Just, you know, out.
{13840}{13952}Oh, out! God, I don't know|why we didn't think to check there.
{13958}{13989}What were you doing?
{13995}{14062}I went to a bar and then...
{14068}{14150}...I just walked around for a while.
{14156}{14268}You walked around all night|in the city by yourself?
{14274}{14341}He hooked up!
{14351}{14382}He hooked up.
{14388}{14464}I don't have to answer your questions.|I'm a big boy.
{14470}{14501}I can do what I want.
{14507}{14574}He hooked up!
{14591}{14652}Tell us about her!
{14658}{14730}Ross, you left your scarf...
{14883}{14966}Hey, you guys.
{15153}{15284}I know what you all are thinking,|but Chandler is in Yemen.
{15291}{15366}I'm a young woman. I have needs.|I can't wait forever.
{15372}{15459}Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
{15471}{15574}So I'm asking you, please|just take a moment before you judge me.
{15580}{15648}Nobody's judging you.
{15690}{15792}Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...
{15806}{15876}...call me.
{16046}{16105}I know what you guys are going to say.
{16111}{16211}You two would have|very hairy children.
{16216}{16280}I didn't know you'd say that.
{16286}{16332}Ross! Janice?
{16338}{16384}All right. Hold on, hold on.
{16390}{16432}This is Ross.
{16438}{16513}He's our friend.|He obviously went crazy.
{16519}{16567}He obviously lost his mind.
{16573}{16675}I didn't lose my mind, okay?|Janice and I have a lot in common.
{16681}{16779}We've both been divorced.|We both have kids.
{16785}{16830}Are you going to see her again?
{16836}{16902}- Don't put ideas in his head!|- I will see her.
{16908}{16994}Damn it, Phoebe!
{17060}{17134}I have to tell you something|that I've never admitted.
{17140}{17241}In high school, I made out with James|even though I knew you liked him.
{17247}{17361}That feels so good to get off my chest.|Okay, you go.
{17361}{17459}My turn? What are you talking about?
{17481}{17565}I know about you and Chandler.
{17585}{17642}I overheard you|on the phone the other day.
{17648}{17748}You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing|laundry for a couple of hours."
{17754}{17824}And he said, "Laundry?|Is that my new nickname?"
{17830}{17875}And you said:
{17881}{18014}"You know what|your nickname is, Mr. Big."
{18113}{18219}You're writing yourself|a little play there, Rach.
{18251}{18297}Let me know how it turns out.
{18303}{18407}I wouldn't know because I got|so freaked out I hung up the phone.
{18413}{18470}Well, if you had kept listening...
{18476}{18561}...you would have heard me|call him Mister...
{18567}{18613}...Bigot.
{18619}{18696}Mr. Bigot.
{18709}{18805}He tells the most racist jokes.
{18811}{18865}All right. So that's it.
{18871}{18960}There's nothing going on|between you and Chandler?
{18966}{19056}Me and Chandler?
{19129}{19162}Put your $20 down.
{19168}{19245}First one to find|the tasty treat wins, okay?
{19251}{19370}All right, let's get the contestants|out of their isolation booths.
{19376}{19448}And they're off!
{19453}{19504}Get your foot off my contestant!|Judge?
{19510}{19593}Judge rules no violation.
{19681}{19781}It's so weird to say this,|but I just had a great date with Janice.
{19787}{19844}- What?|- Are you serious?
{19850}{19942}I opened up to her about all|the stuff that's been happening to me.
{19948}{19992}I mean, I talked for hours.
{19998}{20025}It is amazing...
{20031}{20119}...to have someone give you|such focused attention.
{20125}{20191}You don't need Janice for that.|You've got us.
{20197}{20268}The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
{20274}{20340}That's not a Nutter Butter.|That's an old won ton!
{20346}{20377}Judge rules...
{20383}{20430}...Nutter Butter.
{20436}{20508}Tough call.
{20580}{20694}Seriously, I strongly believe that|we should support President Clinton...
{20700}{20781}...and her husband, Bill.
{20811}{20852}How do you like your coffee?
{20858}{20904}- None for me.|- A little sugar.
{20910}{21033}I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.|That will sweeten it up.
{21106}{21174}- That laugh doesn't give you a headache?|- You get used to it.
{21180}{21214}I don't think that I can.
{21220}{21278}This will be it for me|on the work things.
{21284}{21341}I laugh at my boss's jokes.|What's the big deal?
{21347}{21408}I'd rather not be with|this work-weasel guy...
{21414}{21528}...when I can be with my boyfriend,|who I actually respect.
{21596}{21702}I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.|I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.
{21708}{21812}It's not strong enough|to defend itself.
{21874}{21924}Hear what I said?
{21930}{21975}What?
{21981}{22036}It's a joke.|What's the matter with you?
{22042}{22115}Well, I just didn't think|it was funny, sir.
{22121}{22175}Excuse me?
{22181}{22232}- Well, I just...|- Honey?
{22238}{22315}I just don't think|you understood the joke.
{22321}{22342}Really?
{22348}{22452}I mean, it was really funny.|I just don't think that you got it.
{22458}{22530}You see, Kara's coffee|is weak-tasting.
{22536}{22669}But what Doug did was imply|that it was weak physically.
{22694}{22796}- You get it now, honey?|- I think I do!
{22857}{22958}- Thank you, Monica.|- I thought you could use the help.
{22964}{23051}Coffee in a fight!
{23143}{23241}You mind if I read|my comic books in here?
{23251}{23311}Sure. Why?
{23317}{23433}Chandler and Monica are over there.|It's kind of hard to concentrate.
{23439}{23524}She just called and said|she was going to be working late.
{23530}{23571}She keeps lying to me.
{23577}{23711}That's it! I'm going over there|and confronting them right now.
{23931}{24048}All right, so you're telling me|that I have to tell racist jokes now?
{24054}{24101}I'm just not very good at this.
{24107}{24174}I'm a terrible liar.|I hate having to lie to Rachel.
{24180}{24245}- But we're not ready to tell yet.|- I know.
{24251}{24364}Ever since high school, Rachel was the|one person that I told everything to.
{24370}{24418}I miss that so much now.
{24424}{24511}She's my best friend.
{24699}{24773}Oh, my God, Rachel!
{24820}{24895}What are you doing here?
{24901}{25000}Well, I actually came over here|to borrow this lamp...
{25006}{25067}...to look at my books.
{25073}{25157}You know, see them a little better.
{25159}{25232}Okay, great.
{25238}{25320}Well, what I was doing|in Chandler's room is that...
{25326}{25393}...I was cleaning it.
{25395}{25453}He pays me to clean it.
{25459}{25565}What a great way to make|some extra pocket money.
{25571}{25648}When I said to you earlier|that I was at work...
{25654}{25704}...I'm at my new work.
{25710}{25803}Good enough. Right?
{25856}{25933}I'll go look at my books.
{25955}{26041}Go get back to my new job.
{26151}{26245}Congratulations on your new job!
{26376}{26466}Man, she is really gullible.
{26576}{26627}- Here you go.|- Thanks.
{26633}{26694}- Actually, I should get going.|- You're sure?
{26700}{26750}I can stay out as late as you want.
{26756}{26807}I told you I'm on|sabbatical from work...
{26813}{26884}Yes, yes. You did.
{26890}{26963}- Oh, man!|- What is wrong now?
{26969}{27018}This isn't what I ordered.
{27024}{27133}Man! Can't anything|go right in my life?
{27139}{27213}First, my marriage falls apart,|and then...
{27219}{27244}I know!
{27250}{27313}You lose your apartment,|you lose your job...
{27319}{27451}...your ex-wife gets married so fast!|And now the coffee!
{27486}{27545}We need to talk.
{27551}{27631}- Sometimes I feel...|- No, no, don't.
{27637}{27700}I'm going to talk.
{27706}{27740}I believe...
{27746}{27813}...that the sun has set...
{27819}{27933}...on our day in the sun.
{27959}{28076}You're a very sweet person, Ross.
{28105}{28137}Unfortunately...
{28143}{28277}...I just don't think I can take|another second of you whining!
{28311}{28415}Let me make sure|I'm hearing this right.
{28421}{28505}You're ending this with me because...
{28511}{28584}...I'm too whiny?
{28629}{28672}So you're saying...
{28678}{28754}...I've become so whiny...
{28760}{28799}...that I...
{28805}{28892}...annoy you...
{28898}{28939}...Janice.
{28945}{28975}Well, yeah!
{28981}{29079}Oh, my God!
{29111}{29137}Will you be okay?
{29143}{29221}I am now.
{29475}{29545}I guess, that's two out of three...
{29551}{29616}...Joey!
{29820}{29892}Dude, we got to talk.
{29898}{29989}I want to tell you something before|you heard it from someone else.
{29995}{30094}I hope this isn't too weird but...
{30100}{30199}...I had a thing with Janice.
{30278}{30312}You're not mad?
{30318}{30346}Why would I be mad?
{30352}{30428}Because there's certain rules|about this kind of stuff.
{30434}{30560}You don't fool around with|your friends' ex-girlfriends...
{30560}{30670}...or possible girlfriends|or girls they're related to.
{30765}{30838}I am mad.
{30843}{30902}But you know,|I'm going to forgive you.
{30908}{30955}Because that's what friends do.
{30961}{31063}They forgive their friends when|they do everything you just said.
{31069}{31099}Thank you.
{31105}{31144}But I want you to remember...
{31150}{31243}...that I forgave you.
{31259}{31368}I also want you to remember|that I let you live here rent-free.
{31374}{31405}All right.
{31411}{31494}And I want you to remember|that I gave you...
{31500}{31572}...twenty-seven dollars.
{31578}{31605}No strings attached!
{31611}{31644}If you can't remember that...
{31650}{31752}...we should write it down.|Let's write it down!
{84}{180}I can't believe we've never|done this. It's so good!
{186}{284}It's so good for Monica.
{326}{395}Time's up! My turn.
{411}{506}- That was half an hour?|- It's your timer.
{549}{658}I don't like to brag about it,|but I give the best massages.
{664}{769}All right, then massage me up|right nice!
{856}{891}It's so good, isn't it?
{897}{987}I don't know what|I did to deserve it.
{999}{1040}Say goodbye to sore muscles!
{1046}{1120}Goodbye, muscles!
{1126}{1207}The One with Joey's Bag
{2304}{2388}She gives the worst massages ever!
{2394}{2478}It was like she was torturing me|for information.
{2484}{2585}I wanted to give it up.|I just didn't know what it was!
{2591}{2656}If it hurts that bad,|you should tell her.
{2662}{2728}For the first time,|I'm in a real relationship.
{2734}{2846}I won't screw that up|by telling the truth.
{2861}{2897}Dude, look out!
{2903}{2955}You almost crushed my hat.
{2961}{3003}Sorry.
{3009}{3094}And the bunny got away.
{3257}{3376}This would be the place|where you explain the hat.
{3392}{3427}There's this play, right?
{3433}{3528}I'm up for the part of this|cool, suave, international guy.
{3534}{3578}A clothes horse, so I figure...
{3584}{3693}...everyone at the audition will|wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
{3699}{3765}And you'll make them disappear?
{3771}{3885}Like you could find something|this sophisticated.
{3888}{3941}Done!
{3947}{4049}If you want to look good,|come to the store. I'll help you.
{4055}{4090}- Thanks!|- Sure.
{4096}{4168}Please, take those off!
{4214}{4272}Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?
{4278}{4368}Only okay. Because I just|got back from the hospital.
{4374}{4408}Are you all right?
{4414}{4522}I'm fine.|But my grandma sort of died.
{4526}{4546}Pheebs, sorry.
{4552}{4574}It's okay.
{4580}{4627}She had a really incredible life.
{4633}{4743}It's not like I won't see her again.|She'll visit.
{4769}{4831}Maybe she's with us right now.
{4837}{4955}Right. She's on a new spiritual plain|and she'll come to the coffeehouse.
{4961}{5081}I just saw two people having sex|in a car right outside!
{5113}{5197}Pheebs' grandmother just died.
{5203}{5263}Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
{5269}{5345}Actually, it's kind of cool.|Because it's like...
{5351}{5454}...you know, one life ends|and another begins.
{5458}{5549}Not the way they're doing it.
{5557}{5622}What happened?|How did she die?
{5628}{5654}We were in the market...
{5660}{5796}...and she bent down to get some yogurt|and never came back up again.
{5802}{5833}I'm so sorry.
{5839}{5885}The last thing she said was:
{5891}{6017}"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,|and we'll meet at the checkout counter."
{6023}{6052}You know what?
{6058}{6154}We will meet at the checkout counter.
{6301}{6371}Since you're returning|all this stuff...
{6377}{6448}...you'll have to wear underwear.
{6454}{6559}All right.|You'd better show me that too.
{6561}{6649}It's missing something.
{6797}{6837}Really? A purse?
{6843}{6923}It's not a purse.|It's a shoulder bag.
{6929}{6988}It looks like a woman's purse.
{6994}{7092}Trust me, all the men are carrying|them in the spring catalog.
{7098}{7177}See, look.|Men carrying the bag.
{7183}{7284}See, look.|Women carrying the bag.
{7424}{7576}But it is odd how a woman's purse|looks so good on me, a man.
{7582}{7631}Exactly. Unisex!
{7637}{7749}Maybe you need sex.|I had sex a couple days ago.
{7749}{7871}No, Joey. U-N-I sex.
{7875}{7969}I ain't going to say no to that!
{8139}{8178}- Who is it?|- It's Phoebe.
{8184}{8232}Oh, great!
{8238}{8295}Oh, you.
{8301}{8367}What's up?
{8378}{8493}Well, I sort of have some bad news.|Can I come in?
{8499}{8561}No, thanks.
{8659}{8721}Grandma died today.
{8727}{8790}Didn't she die like five years ago?
{8796}{8866}No, she just died today.
{8872}{8940}We're having|a memorial service tomorrow.
{8946}{9012}Okay, I know I went to that already.
{9018}{9053}No, you didn't!
{9059}{9096}Then who's been dead?
{9102}{9167}Lots of people!
{9192}{9278}Look, are you coming or not?
{9333}{9447}I thought she was dead,|so I've made my peace.
{9450}{9493}Plus I'm going to a concert.
{9499}{9620}I'd invite you,|but I only have two tickets left.
{9622}{9764}- Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.|- Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!
{10009}{10106}You look just like your son,|Mrs. Tribbiani.
{10112}{10216}What? Are you referring|to my man's bag?
{10219}{10302}I thought it just looked good,|but it's practical too.
{10308}{10406}It's got compartments for your|wallet, keys, address book...
{10412}{10469}Your makeup.
{10487}{10549}What are you doing?|The audition's tomorrow.
{10555}{10625}Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
{10631}{10698}You get mustard on that bag,|you can't return it.
{10704}{10771}Why would I return this?|I love this bag!
{10777}{10862}- All right, then you owe me $350.|- Fine.
{10868}{10977}Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?
{10995}{11118}Relax, I'll pay you with the money|from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.
{11124}{11193}What's the part? Auntie Mame?
{11199}{11268}Don't listen to them.|I think it's sexy.
{11274}{11354}You-and-I sexy?
{11487}{11560}Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.|Thank you for coming.
{11566}{11651}Here's your 3-D glasses.
{11679}{11779}Reverend Pong will say|when to put them on.
{11830}{11861}Hi, sweetie.
{11867}{11918}- How are you holding up?|- Fine.
{11924}{12019}Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.
{12026}{12124}You know what?|My grandma had the exact same bag!
{12130}{12159}I brought you flowers.
{12165}{12201}Oh, thanks!
{12207}{12314}Pulling flowers out|makes the bag look masculine.
{12351}{12404}Excuse me, is this the memorial?
{12410}{12450}Welcome.
{12456}{12498}Here's your 3-D glasses.
{12504}{12574}All right.
{12581}{12633}So how did you know Frances?
{12639}{12702}Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.
{12708}{12821}But I was pretty tight|with her and her daughter.
{12827}{12854}What's your name?
{12860}{12938}Frank Buffay.
{12967}{13083}You know what? Strike that.|My name, actually, is Joe.
{13089}{13126}Joe Hill.
{13132}{13152}You're Frank Buf...
{13158}{13240}No! Joe Hill.
{13246}{13270}You just said...
{13276}{13380}I got to go.|Thank you so much for coming.
{13440}{13471}Oh, my God!
{13477}{13507}What happened?
{13513}{13579}That was my dad.
{13587}{13628}Check it out!
{13634}{13719}It's like it's coming right at me.
{13876}{13930}- Did you catch him?|- What did he say?
{13936}{14037}He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."
{14043}{14094}I couldn't give him my real name.
{14100}{14126}Why not?
{14132}{14166}You saw the way he ran.
{14172}{14239}You think he'd talk|to the daughter he abandoned?
{14245}{14286}What did you say to him?
{14292}{14393}I said I was the executor of the will|and I needed to talk to him.
{14399}{14466}I'm going to meet him|at the coffeehouse.
{14472}{14517}Could everyone take their seats?
{14523}{14586}I just can't think about that now.
{14592}{14660}I want to say goodbye to my grandma.
{14666}{14734}Let's go say goodbye.
{15014}{15100}I'm off to my audition.|How do I look?
{15106}{15168}Great!|That bag will get you that part.
{15174}{15249}And a date with a man.
{15259}{15358}You know what? Make fun all you want.|This is a great bag.
{15364}{15428}And it's as handy as it is becoming.
{15434}{15538}Just because you don't understand|something, doesn't make it wrong.
{15544}{15626}You guys have to get used|to the fact that Joey...
{15632}{15711}...comes with a bag!
{15719}{15769}I've got to meet my dad.
{15775}{15815}Will you tell him who you are?
{15821}{15883}Not at first.|I don't want to freak him out.
{15889}{15934}But aren't you pissed at him?
{15940}{15986}This guy abandoned you.
{15992}{16095}If it were me, this guy would be|in some serious physical danger.
{16101}{16214}I'd walk in there,|I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!"
{16220}{16317}"You and me, outside.|Right now!"
{16323}{16386}I kind of scared myself.
{16392}{16479}Well, at least you scared someone.
{16487}{16532}You'd think I'd be angry.
{16538}{16651}You'd think I'd want to rip|his tiny little head off!
{16657}{16718}Fortunately, I'm past it.
{16724}{16819}You do seem a little tense.|Here, let me help you.
{16825}{16867}Get off!
{16873}{16958}Stop it!|Why are you doing that to me?
{16964}{16993}What are you talking about?
{16999}{17068}As a masseuse and a human...
{17074}{17173}...I'm begging you,|never do that to anyone!
{17179}{17255}I give good massages.
{17283}{17384}I gave them to Rachel|before she got allergic.
{17411}{17514}And Chandler, he loves them!|Watch.
{17520}{17576}He does not like it.|He's in pain!
{17582}{17651}- No, he's not.|- Yes, he is!
{17657}{17779}- What?|- I'm sorry but...
{17851}{17885}You've been lying to me?
{17891}{17929}I can't believe that.
{17935}{17983}Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.
{17989}{18104}But the minute we start|to lie to each other...
{18149}{18181}And by "we"...
{18187}{18265}...I mean society.
{18296}{18363}Anytime you're ready.
{18369}{18418}Well, you must be new here.
{18424}{18479}Maybe we get a table,|I buy you a drink.
{18485}{18576}Could you try it without the purse?
{18588}{18664}Yeah, sure.
{18719}{18816}Well, you must be new here.|Maybe we sit...
{18822}{18858}Can I ask you something?
{18864}{18888}Sure. What?
{18894}{18992}Well, first,|it's not a purse.
{19004}{19028}Anytime.
{19034}{19093}If you think|it's a woman's bag, it's not.
{19099}{19160}It's a man's bag.
{19166}{19248}Okay. And go!
{19254}{19325}Let me show you the catalog.
{19331}{19396}Look. See?
{19397}{19430}It's the latest thing.
{19436}{19505}Everyone's got one.|Men, women, children.
{19511}{19580}Do you sell these?
{19606}{19709}No, these babies sell themselves.
{19709}{19748}Thank you.|That was great.
{19754}{19791}But I didn't read anything.
{19797}{19885}I think we've seen enough.
{19892}{19928}All right, I'll see you.
{19934}{20014}We got it. We got it.
{20038}{20100}Is Rachel here?
{20101}{20226}Listen, I just wanted to apologize|about the whole massage thing.
{20232}{20293}I really like them.
{20299}{20373}Please stop!
{20379}{20428}We're supposed to be honest.
{20434}{20556}I wish you could tell me,|"I don't like your massages."
{20631}{20729}I don't like your massages.
{20742}{20823}See? It's no big deal.
{20829}{20872}But now you're crying!
{20878}{21001}I'm not crying about that.|I'm crying about something at work.
{21007}{21095}My boyfriend said|he didn't like my massages.
{21101}{21159}You don't have|to be best at everything.
{21165}{21289}Oh, my God!|You don't know me at all!
{21331}{21392}You give the worst massages|in the world.
{21398}{21456}I'm crying here!
{21462}{21491}Look, hear me out.
{21497}{21593}You give the best bad massages.
{21599}{21672}If anybody was looking|for the best bad massage...
{21678}{21731}...and they thought,|"Who's the best?"
{21737}{21810}They'd have to go to you.
{21921}{21997}So you're saying that|if there was an award...
{22003}{22113}...for the best bad massage...|Who would get that?
{22119}{22157}It would be you!
{22163}{22261}You, Monica!|And you'd get all the votes.
{22267}{22362}So they could call the award,|"The Monica"?
{22378}{22443}Absolutely.
{22486}{22559}I suck!
{22688}{22727}Thank you for meeting me.
{22733}{22776}Thank you.
{22782}{22854}Come sit.
{22871}{22906}Sit.
{22912}{22984}Sit!
{22994}{23063}Alrighty.|Before we get started, I need you...
{23069}{23169}...to state for the record|that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.
{23175}{23259}Yes, I am.
{23297}{23358}What did Frances leave me?
{23364}{23444}That's why you wanted me to come.
{23449}{23554}Yes, she did. She left you...
{23554}{23635}...this lipstick.
{23722}{23804}It's used.
{23824}{23894}Cool!
{23923}{24082}I have just a few questions to ask,|so I'll get out my official forms.
{24129}{24186}So question one:
{24192}{24284}You were married to Frances'|daughter, Lilly. Correct?
{24290}{24353}Yes, I was.
{24359}{24423}Question two:|Did that marriage end...
{24429}{24468}A: Happily?
{24474}{24528}B: Medium?
{24534}{24610}Or C: In the total abandonment...
{24616}{24680}...of her and her two children?
{24686}{24715}It really says that?
{24721}{24784}Yeah, see?
{24796}{24889}I guess then I would have to say C.
{24892}{24968}Total abandonment.
{24968}{25012}Reasons for abandonment:
{25018}{25103}A: Top secret government work.
{25109}{25137}B: Amnesia.
{25143}{25222}Or C: You're just a selfish,|irresponsible...
{25228}{25293}...bad, bad man.
{25299}{25394}I don't want the lipstick that much.
{25399}{25478}Would you do me a favor?
{25484}{25542}Would you give Lilly...
{25548}{25593}...that, please?
{25599}{25651}When you see Lilly,|give her that note.
{25657}{25722}I wanted to talk to her|at the memorial...
{25728}{25853}...but I pictured her getting mad|the way you did, and I chickened out.
{25859}{25919}I wrote her a note.|Give it to her, please?
{25925}{26006}But you came to see Lilly?
{26012}{26057}Yeah. Why?
{26063}{26144}Lilly's dead.
{26144}{26176}She what?
{26182}{26215}She's dead.
{26221}{26245}Are you sure?
{26251}{26353}If she isn't, cremating her|was a big mistake.
{26359}{26428}I can't believe this.|I just can't believe...
{26434}{26517}How?|Oh, my God.
{26523}{26545}How long ago?
{26551}{26622}17 years ago.
{26654}{26738}What about the girls?
{26771}{26900}Well, Ursula is a waitress|and she lives in Soho.
{26909}{26989}And Phoebe...
{26994}{27074}...is on this couch.
{27221}{27336}Yep, lipstick and a daughter.|Big day for you!
{27342}{27449}Phoebe, I...
{27472}{27575}It's just, I don't know what to say.
{27581}{27723}I just can't believe that you're|my daughter. You're so pretty.
{27729}{27829}Yes, well, that's neither|here nor there.
{27847}{27914}Would it make you feel|better if I said...
{27920}{28043}...that I was very, very sorry I left?
{28063}{28140}It doesn't matter what you say.|It won't make a difference.
{28146}{28218}So you can just go.
{28225}{28348}Well, you know, in my defense,|I was a lousy father.
{28354}{28415}- That's your defense?|- Yes, it is.
{28421}{28517}I burned the formula,|and I put your diapers on backwards.
{28523}{28648}I made up a song to sing to you,|but that made you cry even more.
{28654}{28682}You make up songs?
{28688}{28762}Well, no, just that one.|But it was stupid.
{28768}{28863}Let's see, how did it go?
{28869}{28950}{y:i}Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
{28956}{29031}{y:i}Why won't you go to sleep?
{29037}{29102}{y:i}Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
{29108}{29196}{y:i}You're keeping me up
{29616}{29699}I'm not very good at this.
{29738}{29809}Well, I am.
{29908}{29969}Not yet. No.
{30108}{30138}How'd the audition go?
{30144}{30178}Estelle said I didn't get it.
{30184}{30262}What? Why?|Joey, you were so ready for it.
{30268}{30300}I thought so too...
{30306}{30369}...but the casting people|had problems with me.
{30375}{30405}What kind of problem?
{30411}{30473}To tell you the truth...
{30479}{30569}...they had a problem with the bag!
{30569}{30647}You know what?|It was a stupid play anyway.
{30653}{30700}It's time to give up the bag.
{30706}{30768}I don't want to give up the bag.
{30774}{30871}I don't have to give it up,|do I, Rach?
{30916}{30975}You think I should give up the bag!
{30981}{31124}Joey, I'm sorry. As terrific|as I think you are with it...
{31139}{31289}...I just don't know if the world|is ready for you and your bag.
{31312}{31350}I can't believe this!
{31356}{31456}Wait, I'm not saying|you shouldn't have a bag.
{31462}{31575}There are other bags|that are maybe a little less...
{31581}{31636}...controversial.
{31642}{31743}Yeah, they're called wallets.
{89}{212}Guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy's|putting stuff in boxes.
{261}{328}I'd say our naked buddy is moving.
{334}{450}Ironically, most of the boxes|seem to be labeled "Clothes".
{456}{514}I'm going to miss that big|old squishy butt.
{520}{622}And we're done|with the chicken fried rice.
{628}{722}If he's moving, maybe I should|try to get his place!
{728}{792}It would be so cool|to live across from you guys.
{798}{847}We could do that telephone thing...
{853}{915}...where you have a can,|we have a can...
{921}{1000}...and it's connected by a string.
{1006}{1104}Or we could do|the actual telephone thing.
{1110}{1189}The One Where|Everyone Finds Out
{2250}{2322}Oh, my God. I love this apartment!
{2328}{2359}Isn't it perfect?
{2365}{2451}I can't believe I never realized|how great it is!
{2457}{2547}Because your eye goes|to the big naked man.
{2553}{2584}It's amazing!
{2590}{2698}Hurry up with an application,|or I'll beat you to it.
{2786}{2908}Well, I'm going to use|Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
{2989}{3070}Look! There's Monica and Chandler.
{3072}{3150}Hey, you guys!
{3366}{3423}Chandler and Monica!
{3429}{3499}Oh, my God!
{3543}{3566}Oh, my eyes!
{3572}{3634}My eyes!
{3645}{3670}It's okay!
{3676}{3722}- They're doing it!|- I know!
{3728}{3775}- I know!|- You know?
{3781}{3880}Yes, I know it. Joey knows,|but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!
{3886}{3949}What's going on?
{3986}{4019}- What?|- Nothing!
{4025}{4110}We are so excited|that you'll get this apartment!
{4116}{4139}Looks really good.
{4145}{4210}Looks pretty good!
{4216}{4278}Get in here!|Come on!
{4433}{4489}You mean whenever|Monica and Chandler...
{4495}{4571}...were doing laundry|or going grocery shopping?
{4577}{4651}The time Monica spent on the phone|with Linda from camp?
{4657}{4733}Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.
{4739}{4780}I can't believe it!
{4786}{4844}I think it's great. For him.
{4850}{4922}She could do better.
{4940}{4960}Hey, you guys.
{4966}{4998}Come here!
{5004}{5056}Phoebe found out|about Monica and Chandler.
{5062}{5159}You mean how they're friends|and nothing more?
{5178}{5212}Joey, she knows.
{5218}{5307}We saw them doing it|through the window.
{5313}{5429}Actually, we saw them doing it|up against the window.
{5433}{5515}So they know you know,|and they don't know Rachel knows?
{5521}{5593}Yes, but it doesn't matter|who knows what.
{5599}{5675}Now enough of us know|that we could just tell them we know.
{5681}{5753}All the lying and the secrets|will finally be over.
{5759}{5885}Or, we could not tell them we know,|and have a little fun.
{5898}{5924}What do you mean?
{5930}{6061}If they say they are doing laundry,|we'll give them laundry to do.
{6068}{6125}I would enjoy that.
{6131}{6222}You know what would be even more fun?|Telling them.
{6228}{6275}No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.
{6281}{6302}I can't take...
{6308}{6394}You don't have to do anything.|Just don't tell them we know.
{6400}{6442}I can't take anymore secrets.
{6448}{6562}I got your secrets, their secrets,|secrets of my own.
{6569}{6635}You don't have any secrets.
{6641}{6765}Well, you don't know about Hugsy,|my bedtime penguin pal.
{6881}{6944}How are we going to mess with them?
{6950}{7010}You could use your position|as the roommate.
{7016}{7102}And I would use the strongest tool|at my disposal.
{7108}{7168}My sexuality.
{7174}{7241}Hello, children.
{7247}{7338}Watch. Learn.|And don't eat my cookie.
{7416}{7488}That jacket looks great on you.
{7494}{7546}- Really?|- The material is so soft.
{7552}{7632}Hello, Mr. Bicep.
{7655}{7682}You're working out?
{7688}{7773}I try to squeeze things.
{7891}{7923}Are you okay?
{7929}{7980}If you really want to know...
{7986}{8040}I can't tell you this.
{8046}{8087}You can tell me anything.
{8093}{8169}Actually, you are the one person|I can't tell this to.
{8175}{8273}And the one person I want to the most.
{8303}{8354}What's going on?
{8360}{8438}I just haven't been|with a guy in so long...
{8444}{8505}...and sometimes you're|looking for something...
{8511}{8599}...and it's right there|in front of you, sipping coffee...
{8605}{8696}Oh, no. Have I said too much?
{8720}{8833}Just something to think about.|I know I will.
{9114}{9162}You are so cute.
{9168}{9224}How did you get to be so cute?
{9230}{9283}My grandfather was Swedish.
{9289}{9389}And my grandmother was|a tiny little bunny.
{9395}{9470}Now you're even cuter.
{9476}{9578}You know, that is a popular|opinion today, I must say.
{9584}{9646}The weirdest thing happened|at the coffeehouse.
{9652}{9715}Phoebe was hitting on me.
{9721}{9761}What are you talking about?
{9767}{9852}I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
{9908}{9967}It's not possible.
{10036}{10118}I'm sorry, Phoebe's just|always thought you were charming...
{10124}{10174}...in a sexless kind of way.
{10180}{10275}You know, I can't hear that enough.
{10281}{10334}I just think you misunderstood her.
{10340}{10402}I didn't, okay?|She was all over me.
{10408}{10475}She touched my bicep,|for crying out loud.
{10481}{10510}This bicep?
{10516}{10616}Well, it's not flexed right now.
{10728}{10812}Mon, you want to come|see a movie with us?
{10818}{10922}Actually, I was going|to do some laundry.
{10951}{10983}Want to do it with me?
{10989}{11062}Sure, I'll do it with you.
{11068}{11161}Okay, great.|Hold on a second.
{11191}{11245}Here you go.
{11251}{11350}That would really help me out a lot.|Thanks.
{11356}{11415}You know what?|I don't have enough quarters.
{11421}{11502}I have quarters!
{11570}{11623}Hey, any word on the apartment yet?
{11629}{11715}I called there, and it turns out|Naked Guy is subletting it.
{11721}{11779}He's already had 100 applicants.
{11785}{11818}No, I've got the edge.
{11824}{11890}It's not exactly ethical,|but I sent him a bribe...
{11896}{11955}...to tip the scales in my direction.
{11961}{12036}You can see it from the window.
{12076}{12191}Is it that pinball machine|with the big bow on it?
{12201}{12281}That new mountain bike?
{12320}{12350}What did you send?
{12356}{12444}A basket of mini muffins.
{12450}{12553}There's a whole table of them.|Which one did you send?
{12559}{12620}The small one.
{12626}{12743}You actually thought that basket|was going to get you the apartment?
{12749}{12861}Someone sent us a basket at work, and|people went crazy over those muffins.
{12867}{12906}It was the best day.
{12912}{12995}Your work makes me sad.
{13001}{13073}Oh, man, I want that place so much!
{13079}{13144}And I was so sure|that was going to work.
{13150}{13239}There's 12 bucks|I'll never see again.
{13245}{13317}We'd better go if we want|to catch that movie.
{13323}{13361}Bye.
{13367}{13471}Bye, Chandler.|I miss you already.
{13559}{13628}Did you see that? The inappropriate,|and the pinching?
{13634}{13660}Actually, I did.
{13666}{13763}So do you believe|that she's attracted to me?
{13775}{13846}Oh, my God!|She knows about us!
{13852}{13874}Are you serious?
{13880}{13945}She knows, and she's trying|to freak us out!
{13951}{14036}That's the only explanation!
{14080}{14190}But what about my pinchable butt|and my bulging biceps?
{14196}{14260}She knows!
{14470}{14522}Phoebe knows about us.
{14528}{14559}I didn't tell them!
{14565}{14590}Them?
{14596}{14654}Who's "them"?
{14660}{14755}Phoebe and Joey.
{14809}{14839}And Rachel.
{14845}{14922}I would have told you,|but I promised not to tell.
{14928}{14948}I'm sorry.
{14954}{14995}But it's over now, right?
{15001}{15144}You can tell them you know they know,|and I can go back to knowing nothing!
{15146}{15179}Unless...
{15185}{15245}Not "unless"!|This must end now!
{15251}{15335}They think they are so slick|messing with us.
{15341}{15453}But they don't know|that we know that they know.
{15454}{15473}So...
{15479}{15608}The messers become the messees!
{15662}{15722}Honey, you got to stop|torturing yourself.
{15728}{15776}Why don't you find another apartment?
{15782}{15850}I've already looked|at 1000 apartments this month.
{15856}{15920}None of them even compares|to that one.
{15926}{15955}You know what?
{15961}{16060}You should find out his hobbies|and use that to bond with him.
{16066}{16112}Like if I wanted something from Joey...
{16118}{16255}...I would strike up a conversation|about sandwiches...
{16275}{16334}...or my underwear.
{16340}{16410}I'm listening.
{16447}{16503}That is a great idea!
{16509}{16618}And I know Ugly Naked Guy because|we've been watching him for five years.
{16624}{16705}So that gives me back my edge!
{16711}{16777}Let's see now.|He had the trampoline.
{16783}{16805}He broke that.
{16811}{16902}- He had gravity boots.|- He broke those too.
{16908}{17016}So he likes to break stuff.
{17038}{17134}I've got to go pick up Ben.|But I will figure something out.
{17140}{17182}Didn't he used to have a cat?
{17188}{17253}I wouldn't bring that up.|It would bum him out.
{17259}{17364}Poor cat never saw|that big butt coming.
{17469}{17524}Hold on a second,|she's right here.
{17530}{17587}It's Chandler.
{17638}{17685}Hello, you.
{17691}{17796}Phoebe, I've been thinking|about you all day.
{17835}{17930}You know that thing you said before?|I was intrigued.
{17936}{17963}Really?
{17969}{18007}Joey won't be here tonight.
{18013}{18105}Why don't you come over?|I'll let you feel my bicep.
{18111}{18196}Or maybe more.
{18220}{18311}I'll have to get back to you on that.
{18329}{18430}He wants me to come over|and feel his bicep and more!
{18436}{18463}Are you kidding?
{18469}{18566}I cannot believe|he would do that to Mon...
{18740}{18843}Joey? Do they know that we know?
{18875}{18894}They know you know.
{18900}{18958}I knew it!
{18964}{19013}I cannot believe those two!
{19019}{19146}They thought they could mess with us?|Trying to mess with us?
{19165}{19276}They don't know that we know|they know we know.
{19281}{19328}Joey, you can't say anything.
{19334}{19414}Couldn't if I wanted to.
{19544}{19660}Good evening, sir. I'm Ross Geller.|I'm one of the applicants.
{19666}{19800}I realize that the competition|is fierce but...
{19803}{19951}I'm sorry, I can't help but notice|that you're naked.
{20005}{20044}I applaud you.
{20050}{20119}Man, I wish I was naked.
{20125}{20210}I mean, this looks so great.
{20216}{20316}That is how God intended it.
{20341}{20377}Look. They're panicked!
{20383}{20454}They'll totally back down.
{20461}{20530}If he wants a date,|he's going to get a date.
{20536}{20574}I'm going to go in.
{20580}{20651}Be sexy.
{20651}{20714}Please.
{20953}{21043}I'd love to come by tonight.
{21104}{21123}Really?
{21129}{21217}Absolutely.|Say, around seven?
{21286}{21419}I'm really looking forward to you|and me having sexual intercourse.
{21528}{21562}Hey, check it out!
{21568}{21648}Naked Guy's got a naked friend.
{21829}{21923}Oh, my God!|That's our friend!
{21929}{22016}It's Naked Ross!
{22111}{22157}Showtime!
{22163}{22200}Rachel, get me perfume.
{22206}{22312}Joey, can you get me|a bottle of wine and glasses?
{22446}{22585}Make her think you want to have|sex with her and it will freak her out.
{22591}{22646}How far would I have to go with her?
{22652}{22699}She'll give in way before you do.
{22705}{22726}How do you know?
{22732}{22838}Because you're on my team.|My team always wins.
{22844}{22898}At this?
{22904}{23002}Just go get some! Go!
{23013}{23078}Now, I'm going to try to listen|from right here.
{23084}{23124}Oh, wait.
{23130}{23160}Good idea.
{23166}{23256}Don't give away the farm.
{23460}{23515}Come on in.
{23521}{23584}I was going to.
{23620}{23674}I brought some wine.|Would you like some?
{23680}{23747}Sure.
{23904}{23939}So here we are.
{23945}{23970}Nervous?
{23976}{24025}Me? No. You?
{24031}{24101}I want this to happen.
{24118}{24180}So do I.
{24479}{24528}I'm going to put on some music.
{24534}{24636}Maybe I'll dance for you.
{25061}{25137}You look good.
{25138}{25180}Thanks.
{25186}{25279}You know, when you say|things like that, it makes me...
{25285}{25412}...want to rip that|sweater vest right off.
{25421}{25467}Why don't we move into the bedroom?
{25473}{25493}Really?
{25499}{25584}Do you not want to?
{25589}{25663}First I want to take off|all my clothes...
{25669}{25765}...and have you rub lotion on me.
{25771}{25851}That would be nice.
{25883}{25966}I'll go get the lotion.
{26025}{26098}It's way out of hand.|She wants me to put lotion on her!
{26104}{26168}- She's bluffing!|- She's not backing down.
{26174}{26251}She went like this...
{26269}{26374}He's not backing down.|He went to get lotion.
{26406}{26454}Aren't you guys done yet?
{26460}{26528}I want to sit in my chair!
{26534}{26655}The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner|it's over and out in the open.
{26661}{26719}I like that.
{26725}{26853}Show him your bra.|He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
{26994}{27054}You didn't rip off any buttons.
{27060}{27134}It's not my first time.
{27154}{27223}Go back there and seduce her|till she cracks!
{27229}{27278}Give me a second.
{27284}{27391}- Did you clean up in here?|- Of course!
{27496}{27530}You're going?
{27536}{27621}Not without you, lover.
{27706}{27819}So, this is my bra.
{27869}{27962}It's very, very nice.
{27971}{28030}Well, come here.
{28036}{28138}I'm very happy we're going|to have all the sex.
{28141}{28259}You should be.|I'm very bendy.
{28336}{28367}I'll kiss you now.
{28373}{28454}Not if I kiss you first.
{28903}{28988}I guess there's nothing|left for us to do but kiss.
{28994}{29058}Here it comes.
{29064}{29138}Our first kiss.
{29351}{29399}You win!
{29405}{29425}I can't have sex with you!
{29431}{29480}- And why not?|- I'm in love with Monica!
{29486}{29556}You're what?
{29579}{29602}Love her!
{29608}{29637}I love her!
{29643}{29741}I love her!
{29810}{29870}I love you, Monica.
{29876}{29961}I love you too, Chandler.
{30060}{30178}I thought you were doing it.|I didn't know you were in love!
{30210}{30280}Dude!
{30286}{30383}Hats off to Phoebe.|Quite a competitor.
{30393}{30447}May I say your breasts|are still showing?
{30453}{30505}God.
{30511}{30548}All right!|So that's it?
{30554}{30595}It's over.|Everybody knows!
{30601}{30637}Actually, Ross doesn't.
{30643}{30739}We'd appreciate it|if no one told him yet.
{30891}{30940}A new place for a new Ross.
{30946}{31036}I'll have you and the guys from work|over, once it's furnished.
{31042}{31093}It's nice to see you|back on your feet.
{31099}{31194}I am that, and the whole rage thing|is definitely behind me.
{31200}{31274}I wonder if it's time for you|to rejoin our museum team?
{31280}{31313}That would be great.
{31319}{31436}I am totally ready|to come back to work.
{31544}{31612}What are you doing?
{31618}{31726}Get off my sister!
{56}{156}Chandler! Chandler!
{205}{262}I saw what you were doing|in the window!
{268}{365}I saw what you're doing to my sister!|Get out here!
{371}{427}Listen, we had a good run.
{433}{485}What was it?|Four, five months?
{491}{602}That's more than most people|have in a lifetime. Goodbye.
{619}{688}- What are you doing?|- I am going on the lam.
{694}{769}Come on, Chandler.|I can handle Ross.
{775}{847}Hold on!
{884}{960}Hey, Ross.|What's up, bro?
{980}{1076}What the hell are you doing?
{1082}{1102}What's going on?
{1108}{1226}I think Ross knows|about me and Monica.
{1232}{1331}Dude, he's right there.
{1346}{1421}I thought you were my best friend!|This is my sister!
{1427}{1499}My best friend and my sister!|I cannot believe this!
{1505}{1598}We're not just messing around.|I love her.
{1604}{1671}I'm in love with her.
{1677}{1758}I'm so sorry that you|had to find out this way.
{1764}{1879}I'm sorry, but it's true.|I love him too.
{1995}{2093}My best friend and my sister!
{2131}{2220}I cannot believe this!
{2237}{2350}You guys want to probably|get some hugs in too. Big news!
{2356}{2442}We've actually known for a while.
{2512}{2579}What? You guys knew?
{2585}{2635}You all knew and|you didn't tell me?
{2641}{2801}We were worried about you. We didn't|know how you were going to react.
{2835}{2914}You were worried about me?
{2920}{3004}You didn't know how I'd react?
{3042}{3097}Okay. All right.
{3103}{3237}Let's clear out of here and let|these love birds get back to business.
{3280}{3405}I'm just talking here.|He's the one doing your sister.
{3443}{3523}The One with the Girl Who Hits Joey
{4397}{4437}You know what I just realized?
{4443}{4478}If you guys have kids...
{4484}{4511}We're having kids?
{4517}{4584}I call godfather!
{4592}{4676}You can't just call godfather.
{4682}{4739}Shouldn't her brother be godfather?
{4745}{4840}Sure. If you cared enough|to call it first.
{4844}{4950}- You're a few steps ahead of us.|- Big zero gravity moon steps.
{4956}{5024}I just thought of|the greatest wedding gift.
{5030}{5131}I'll go in on that with you.|I couldn't decide.
{5157}{5190}Hey, Katie.
{5196}{5235}This is Katie.
{5241}{5263}You ready to go?
{5269}{5315}I'll run to the bathroom.
{5321}{5343}Where's lunch?
{5349}{5392}I was thinking Chinese food.
{5398}{5431}I love Chinese!
{5437}{5537}How did you know I love Chinese?
{5589}{5623}She is so cute.
{5629}{5714}You could fit her|in your pocket.
{5715}{5810}I don't know. I like her a lot,|and she's really nice, but...
{5816}{5890}But what?
{5894}{5977}She keeps punching me.
{5991}{6057}In the cute little,|sweet way she just did?
{6063}{6146}It's a lot harder than it looks.
{6152}{6216}She's hurting me.
{6222}{6287}I know what you need.|You need a bodyguard.
{6293}{6377}What is Ben doing after preschool?
{6394}{6533}Joey is having a problem.|A little girl is beating him up.
{6537}{6566}Joey, come here.
{6572}{6653}Honey, I know. This must be|really difficult for you, and...
{6659}{6736}I'm sorry, am I hurting you?
{6980}{7031}I brought you some housewarming gifts.
{7037}{7106}Salt, so your life always has flavor.
{7112}{7181}Bread, so you never go hungry.
{7187}{7251}And a scented candle for the bathroom.
{7257}{7332}Because, well, you know.
{7339}{7462}Thanks. Thanks.|And thanks, I guess.
{7476}{7563}Welcome. I'm Steve Cera,|President of the tenants' committee.
{7569}{7654}Ross Geller.|And this is my friend Phoebe.
{7660}{7731}Mr. President.
{7737}{7818}I came to talk to you|about Howard.
{7824}{7883}He is the handyman|who's retiring next week.
{7889}{8005}Everyone who lives here is kicking in|$100 as a kind of a thank you.
{8011}{8044}That's nice.
{8050}{8122}Want to give me a check?
{8188}{8248}Not now. You can|slip it under my door.
{8254}{8295}No, it's not that.
{8301}{8383}I just moved in.
{8389}{8463}Well, the guy's worked here|for 25 years.
{8469}{8567}Yes, but I've lived here|for 25 minutes.
{8624}{8675}Okay, I get it.
{8681}{8793}Wait! Look, I'm sorry, it's just|I've never even met Howard.
{8799}{8855}I mean, I don't know Howard.
{8861}{8945}Howard's the handyman.
{8951}{9053}Yes, but to me he's just "man".
{9059}{9131}Okay. Fine. Whatever.
{9137}{9232}Welcome to the building.
{9257}{9311}Can you believe that guy?
{9317}{9407}I really like his glasses.
{9502}{9581}So then President Steve|told everyone I was a cheapskate...
{9587}{9634}...and now the whole building hates me.
{9640}{9724}A little kid spit on my knee.
{9730}{9751}You know what?
{9757}{9833}I'll throw a party.|For everyone in the building.
{9839}{9931}And I'll sit them all down and|explain that I am not a bad guy.
{9937}{10003}I am not a cheap guy.|I'm just a guy...
{10009}{10066}...who stands up|for what he believes in.
{10072}{10138}A man with principles.
{10144}{10222}Sounds like a fun party.
{10236}{10324}If you want them to like you,|why don't you just pay the $100?
{10330}{10372}The party will cost you more.
{10378}{10415}That doesn't matter!
{10421}{10508}It's my principles!|We're talking about my principles!
{10514}{10590}I thought it was about|your neighbors liking you.
{10596}{10725}They'll like me once|they come to my awesome par-tay.
{10735}{10811}I gotta get some name tags.
{10870}{10990}And that crazy party animal|will be your brother-in-law.
{10992}{11051}Very funny.|But don't say that to Monica.
{11057}{11116}Don't put any ideas in her head.
{11122}{11239}You do realize that those ideas|are probably already in Monica's head?
{11245}{11306}Why?
{11312}{11405}Well, because she loves you|and because you love her.
{11411}{11484}Yeah, so? What's|that supposed to mean?
{11490}{11580}Don't freak out! I'm telling you|something you already know.
{11586}{11660}She left Richard because|he didn't want to have babies.
{11666}{11793}And she is a woman. And she's|almost 30. And, you know, it's Monica.
{11799}{11852}I don't see it that way.|I see two Monicas:
{11858}{11962}My friend who lives across|the hall and wants a lot of babies.
{11968}{12026}And the new Monica|who I started to date.
{12032}{12119}Now, who is to say what she wants?
{12125}{12168}I'm right.
{12174}{12246}Am I right?
{12268}{12291}You're right.
{12297}{12411}You're absolutely right.|That makes everything different.
{12417}{12449}It's not different, is it?
{12455}{12544}Not unless "different"|means the same.
{12557}{12692}You were so funny with that waiter.|You're such a nut!
{12796}{12867}You know, breadstick fangs|are always funny.
{12873}{12984}No, you make them funny.|You're the funny one!
{13020}{13109}Look, Katie.|Listen, we need to talk, okay?
{13115}{13218}Look, I like you.|I really do. I like you a lot.
{13224}{13305}But sometimes when you|playfully punch me like that...
{13311}{13471}...it feels like I'm being hit|with a very tiny but a very real bat!
{13508}{13546}Like I could hurt you.
{13552}{13596}Are you making fun of my size?
{13602}{13734}Don't make fun of me|because of my size!
{13827}{13883}Isn't this great?
{13889}{13987}Couldn't you just|stay like this forever?
{14066}{14113}Couldn't you just stay here forever?
{14119}{14236}Yeah, here, somewhere else.|You know, wherever.
{14242}{14271}Are you okay?
{14277}{14304}I'm cool.
{14310}{14361}Casual.
{14367}{14401}What are you doing?
{14407}{14549}Just hanging out. Having fun|with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
{14554}{14631}Man, I knew it!|I knew you'd do this.
{14637}{14743}Get all freaked out because|everybody was joking about marriage!
{14749}{14822}Well, you do want|all that stuff, right?
{14828}{14862}You know what I want?
{14868}{14968}Yes! You want babies!|You have baby fever!
{14974}{15015}I do not have baby fever!
{15021}{15090}You're obsessed|with babies and marriage...
{15096}{15193}...and everything that's|related to babies and marriage.
{15199}{15325}Why don't we turn the heat|down on this pressure cooker!
{15331}{15375}Have you lost your mind?
{15381}{15482}This isn't about me. This is about|you and your weird commitment crap!
{15488}{15611}I know you. I know the thoughts|that you have in your head.
{15617}{15651}You don't know everything.
{15657}{15740}Did you know I'm going out|with Rachel tonight instead of you?
{15746}{15795}And that the only baby here is you?
{15801}{15912}Did you know I can't even|look at you now?
{15936}{16001}I did not know that.
{16081}{16178}It'll be okay, right?|She won't leave me. This is fixable.
{16184}{16232}- Yeah, sure.|- Absolutely.
{16238}{16302}By me?
{16357}{16413}Unless you make some big gesture.
{16419}{16479}Big, though.
{16485}{16546}The missus!
{16557}{16631}Gunther, can I get a coffee?
{16637}{16698}To go.
{16706}{16753}I still don't want to talk to you.
{16759}{16824}Tell me how to make things right.
{16830}{16861}That's what we do.
{16867}{16941}I mess up, you tell me|how to fix it and I do.
{16947}{17042}And then you think I'm cute again.
{17044}{17115}I'm really tired of being|your relationship tutor.
{17121}{17191}Figure this out for yourself.
{17197}{17256}If you're afraid|of a real relationship...
{17262}{17347}...then don't be in one.
{18223}{18324}Howard! Howard! Howard!
{18586}{18654}Hi, Ross!
{18660}{18696}What are you doing here?
{18702}{18790}I thought this was your party,|and it's a party for Howard.
{18796}{18864}He's the sweetest little man.
{18870}{18941}See you, Phoebe.|And thanks for chipping in.
{18947}{18996}Oh, sure.
{19002}{19038}You chipped in?
{19044}{19089}Yeah, $100.
{19095}{19154}I can't believe you gave him money.
{19160}{19262}I thought you agreed it was unreasonable|that they asked me for that money.
{19268}{19306}But they didn't ask me.
{19312}{19426}I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.|That's always fun to be.
{19432}{19483}But you're making me look bad.
{19489}{19563}No, I'm not! If anything,|I'm making you look better.
{19569}{19663}They'll see you|talking to me. I'm a hit.
{19669}{19715}Hey, Pheebs!
{19721}{19760}Hey, Ross.
{19766}{19819}Maybe you two could|switch apartments.
{19825}{19888}Because Phoebe is more|our kind of people.
{19894}{19961}Think about it.
{20015}{20092}Okay, my bad.
{20446}{20508}You look big.
{20514}{20566}Thanks, I've been working out.
{20572}{20687}Listen, is it obvious|I'm wearing six sweaters?
{20712}{20771}But it's not obvious why.
{20777}{20858}I'm breaking up with Katie,|so I put on some extra padding.
{20864}{20964}If she hits me when she is happy,|can you imagine how hard she'll hit...
{20970}{21067}...when I take away the Joey love?
{21166}{21206}Hey, cute jacket.
{21212}{21248}Thanks.
{21254}{21344}- That's so sweet!|- Ouch!
{21402}{21544}Did Joey tell you to say that?|You guys are too much!
{21556}{21616}You know what?|I got to tell you...
{21622}{21722}...I think you're the one|that is too much.
{21734}{21803}Joey has the nicest friends.
{21809}{21905}And the nicest girlfriend.
{21915}{21971}You're so sweet!
{21977}{22062}You're so sweet!
{22205}{22287}She just kicked me.
{22367}{22455}Aren't you going to do something?
{22461}{22567}Do something or I'll walk|out that door right now.
{22587}{22662}Are you going to?
{23155}{23233}This is a disaster.|Can't I please just go?
{23239}{23280}I'm talking you up to people.
{23286}{23387}Give it some time, relax.|Get something to eat.
{23462}{23507}What did you tell them about me?
{23513}{23598}I told them about you and Emily.|Trying to get some sympathy.
{23604}{23691}But you came off as the bad guy.
{23706}{23771}I told it wrong.
{23771}{23912}We should talk about that, because|I don't understand what happened there.
{23935}{23986}This cake is really good!
{23992}{24026}Things are looking up.
{24032}{24172}Oh, my God!|Someone cut Howard's cake!
{24223}{24322}Who would do a thing like that?
{24426}{24491}3-B.
{24513}{24580}You got your free food.|You ruined everyone's fun.
{24586}{24664}Isn't it time you went home?
{24677}{24764}Go back to 3-B, 3-B.
{24770}{24899}Everyone, calm down!|I have something that I'd like to say.
{24929}{25005}Who here likes Ross?
{25093}{25130}Of course you don't like him.
{25136}{25180}He didn't give you any money.
{25186}{25271}He raised his own hand|when I asked, "Who likes Ross?"
{25277}{25359}And he's wearing two name tags.
{25402}{25534}I'll be honest. When I first met Ross,|I didn't like him at all.
{25550}{25631}Once I got to know him,|I saw that he is really sweet...
{25637}{25718}...and caring and very generous.
{25724}{25815}All I'm saying is don't judge|Ross before you get to know him.
{25821}{25938}You know, I like all of you guys now.|But when I first met you, you know?
{25944}{26036}Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.
{26057}{26080}Lola?
{26086}{26175}Mind-numbingly stupid.
{26208}{26320}You guys. Gold digger,|cradle-robbing perv.
{26338}{26452}So I think you all know what I mean.
{26571}{26680}Obviously, I didn't think|they would throw things.
{26685}{26764}I thought if I kept insulting them|you'd defend them.
{26770}{26855}Then you'd look like the hero.
{26885}{26966}See, I did not get that.
{27037}{27124}Where's Monica? I need|to talk to her, it's urgent.
{27130}{27159}I'm Monica.
{27165}{27241}I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
{27247}{27280}I've been thinking...
{27286}{27413}...about us. A lot of "us" thinking.
{27417}{27517}I guess there's|only one way to do this.
{27591}{27646}What are you doing?
{27652}{27686}Don't do it.
{27692}{27762}Will you marry me?
{27819}{27877}What a bad idea.
{27883}{27967}I can't not look at it.
{27981}{28024}Why are you doing this?
{28030}{28075}I don't know.
{28081}{28176}But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
{28192}{28289}I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
{28307}{28411}Do you think the best reason|to get married is because you're sorry?
{28417}{28499}The best reason is pregnancy.
{28553}{28674}Sorry is fourth, behind being ready|and actually wanting to get married.
{28680}{28765}Will you be my wife?
{28814}{28958}I want you to take a minute and think|about how ridiculous this sounds.
{29011}{29112}I'm kind of wishing|everyone wasn't here now.
{29151}{29191}None of that came from me.
{29197}{29282}I never said I wanted to have babies|and get married!
{29288}{29365}I was really confused.|Then I talked to these guys.
{29371}{29463}Who? Two divorces and Joey?
{29474}{29547}She's right, you know?
{29550}{29657}Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
{29663}{29731}You know when I said|that I want you...
{29737}{29811}...to deal with relationship stuff|all on your own?
{29817}{29855}You're not ready.
{29861}{29942}I didn't think I was!
{30024}{30053}Oh, my God.
{30059}{30123}What would you have done|if I had said yes?
{30129}{30174}I would've been happy because...
{30180}{30294}...I would spend the rest of|my life with the woman I love.
{30300}{30416}Or you would have seen|a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.
{30530}{30566}Will you pass that knife?
{30572}{30612}No, I will not.
{30618}{30674}You don't have to be mean about it.
{30680}{30788}You're right. I'm sorry.|Will you marry me?
{30843}{30973}I was going to ask you to marry me|because I didn't say hello to you.
{30979}{31094}Or ask them to move in with you.|But I'm not sure. Chandler?
{31100}{31136}How long is this going to go on?
{31142}{31189}I think the length of teasing...
{31195}{31311}...is directly related to how insane|you were. So, a long time.
{31317}{31341}This is fun!
{31347}{31403}Remember that|"we were on a break" thing?
{31409}{31497}I'm sorry.|Will you marry me?
{31609}{31682}That's not funny.
{263}{362}- What are you guys doing up?|- Finishing the crossword.
{368}{455}Do you know a six-letter|word for "red"?
{461}{526}Dark-red.
{531}{654}Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots|in here for you later.
{660}{729}Hey, how about maroon?
{735}{826}Yes! You are so smart!
{836}{869}You guys are so cute.
{875}{924}I know.
{930}{1006}See you in the morning.
{1308}{1374}I love doing crossword|puzzles with you.
{1380}{1400}Me too.
{1406}{1468}Now let's finish this|and go to bed.
{1474}{1506}Only one left.
{1512}{1618}Three-letter word.|Not dog, but...
{1624}{1690}Cat.
{1730}{1807}You are so smart!
{1831}{1856}I love you.
{1862}{1933}I love you too.
{2239}{2317}The One with a Cop
{3478}{3510}We still need a tip.
{3516}{3575}All right. Hold on.
{3581}{3628}I got it.
{3634}{3678}Nickel.
{3684}{3754}- How much do we need?|- Couple of bucks.
{3760}{3810}Okay, dime.
{3816}{3888}You guys keep talking.|This could take a while.
{3894}{3959}Wait, look it!
{3965}{4010}This is a police badge!
{4016}{4151}Cool. But why would a cop come|in here? They don't serve doughnuts.
{4166}{4284}Can you discover the badge again?|I can do better than that.
{4290}{4339}I bet somebody's|missing that badge.
{4345}{4422}I should take it back.|But at the police station...
{4428}{4474}...I'll check their|Ten Most Wanted.
{4480}{4607}My friend's been Number 11 forever.|This could be her year!
{4624}{4726}- Hey, you guys.|- Hey, Joey.
{4746}{4803}Is that my sweatshirt?
{4809}{4890}Yes, it is. I'm sorry.|I was cold. I hope it's okay.
{4896}{4980}It's just that if you wear|someone's sweatshirt...
{4986}{5040}...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?
{5046}{5116}And I'm not him.
{5121}{5180}I'm sorry.|I'll give it back.
{5186}{5263}It's going to be all|smelling like Monica.
{5269}{5319}Do I smell bad?
{5325}{5422}You smell like a meadow.
{5445}{5502}I'm sorry.
{5544}{5569}What's with him?
{5575}{5716}The last time Joey went to a meadow,|his mother was shot by a hunter.
{6094}{6147}I still don't know.
{6153}{6247}I want to make sure I bought|the right couch, one that says...
{6253}{6355}..."Kids welcome here",|but that also says...
{6361}{6434}..."Come here to me."
{6469}{6574}What? You say that to kids?
{6590}{6714}The "Come here to me" is,|you know, for the ladies.
{6720}{6831}Honey, it's a nice couch,|not a magic couch.
{6844}{6900}Well, you picked a great couch.
{6906}{6965}- Sign here please.|- Sure.
{6971}{7067}The delivery charge|is almost as much as the couch!
{7073}{7144}That's ridiculous.|He lives three blocks away.
{7150}{7230}I'll take it myself.|Thank you.
{7236}{7336}All right, Rach, come on.|Let's go.
{7434}{7493}Are you kidding?
{7499}{7635}Come on. It's only three blocks.|It's not very heavy. Try it.
{7726}{7775}Oh, I can do it.
{7781}{7855}You two will really|enjoy that couch.
{7861}{7940}We're not together.
{7946}{8047}Something didn't quite add up there.
{8177}{8236}What's that supposed to mean?
{8242}{8298}Well, you. Her.
{8304}{8347}I mean, she's very...
{8353}{8382}...you know.
{8388}{8430}And you're, like...
{8436}{8496}...you know?
{8536}{8627}Not that it's any of your business,|but we did go out.
{8633}{8691}Really? You two?
{8697}{8780}I don't want to do this now.|I'm carrying a heavy couch.
{8786}{8849}Then tell him quickly.
{8855}{8899}Fine. We went out.
{8905}{8960}Not only did we go out...
{8966}{9070}...we did it 298 times!
{9135}{9245}You kept count?|You are such a loser!
{9251}{9382}A loser you did it with 298 times!
{9501}{9603}Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put|your cigarette out on a tree.
{9609}{9664}Yeah, I can.|It worked well.
{9670}{9743}But you shouldn't.|So don't ever do that again.
{9749}{9819}I won't till I have|my next cigarette.
{9825}{9854}Hold it!
{9860}{9943}NYPD. Freeze, punk!
{9954}{10037}That's right. You are so busted.
{10043}{10106}Book them.
{10114}{10187}- Who are you talking to?|- Save it, red!
{10193}{10295}Apologize to the tree or|spend the night in the slammer.
{10301}{10368}I am not apologizing to a tree.
{10374}{10497}Apologize to the tree now,|or I am calling for backup.
{10519}{10549}Backup! Backup!
{10555}{10593}I'm sorry! Sorry!
{10599}{10710}Okay, cancel backup!|Cancel backup!
{10743}{10818}Didn't you say there was|an elevator in here?
{10824}{10927}Yes, I did, but there isn't.|Here we go!
{10937}{10979}Okay, go left.
{10985}{11025}Left. Left.
{11031}{11128}Okay, you know what?|There's no more left left.
{11134}{11190}Lift it straight up over your head.
{11196}{11248}Straight up. You can do it!
{11254}{11285}You can do it!
{11291}{11328}Okay. You got it?
{11334}{11371}- Go, go.|- Good, good.
{11377}{11487}You got it, right?|You got it, right? You got...
{11566}{11671}Any chance you think|it looks good there?
{11677}{11729}This guy was all...
{11735}{11824}And I'm all,|"Buffay! Homicide!"
{11830}{11878}It was just so cool!
{11884}{12004}- You were supposed to take it back.|- I'm having fun doing good deeds.
{12010}{12098}You can get arrested|for impersonating a police officer.
{12104}{12192}You could get arrested|right now!
{12226}{12348}I'd better take it back.|I'm totally drunk with power.
{12564}{12635}Yeah. I didn't know|you guys would be here.
{12641}{12727}- Do me a favor. Taste this.|- What? Why?
{12733}{12772}- What is with you?|- Nothing.
{12778}{12825}You're acting strange.
{12831}{12917}All right. There is something.
{12923}{12995}I kind of had a dream.
{13001}{13055}But I don't want to talk about it.
{13061}{13166}What if Martin Luther King|had said that?
{13170}{13250}I kind of have a dream.
{13256}{13343}I don't want to talk about it.
{13349}{13403}Look, it involved Monica.
{13409}{13476}You dreamt about the girl I'm seeing?|Cool.
{13482}{13535}I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.
{13541}{13632}Let's talk about your dream.|I love you. Your dream?
{13638}{13714}There was no sex.|I haven't dreamt of her like that...
{13720}{13820}...since I found out|about you two-ish.
{13899}{13986}What was the dream about?
{14003}{14090}You were my girlfriend.|We were doing the crossword puzzle.
{14096}{14139}Like you did last night.
{14145}{14221}That's it. I'm in love|with Monica. I'll move out.
{14227}{14328}Joey, come on. That doesn't mean|you're in love with me.
{14334}{14357}It doesn't?
{14363}{14404}It could mean anything.|Like...
{14410}{14509}...you're jealous that I've become|the apartment stud.
{14515}{14593}Sounds like your dream.
{14621}{14740}Or it could mean you saw Chandler|and me being close and stuff...
{14746}{14792}...and you want that too.
{14798}{14865}In the dream|I did enjoy the closeness.
{14871}{14920}Are you attracted to Monica?
{14926}{15051}Right here, right now,|are you attracted to her?
{15068}{15117}- Not really.|- There you have it!
{15123}{15234}Well, sure!|I'm just wearing sweats!
{15240}{15266}But that's good!
{15272}{15346}You're not in love with me.|You just want a girlfriend.
{15352}{15414}It's not just about|getting a girlfriend.
{15420}{15529}I could get a girlfriend.|We could sit and do crossword puzzles.
{15535}{15610}But could we have|the closeness like you have?
{15616}{15711}Monica and I were friends|before we dated. Maybe that's it.
{15717}{15763}Friends first?
{15769}{15828}That's interesting.
{15834}{15948}- You become friends after?|- No, never done that either.
{15954}{16006}Do you guys have the tape measure?
{16012}{16098}Yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.
{16104}{16174}That's right.
{16449}{16522}What's up, Joey?
{16551}{16627}How you doing?
{16823}{16882}Excuse me. Is this your car?
{16888}{16964}Don't park here.|You're blocking the entrance.
{16970}{17015}Don't worry.|It's not a problem.
{17021}{17176}It's a problem for me, so it's a|problem for you because I'm a cop.
{17195}{17265}So am I.
{17376}{17450}Okay. So you're a cop.|You can park anywhere.
{17456}{17504}I know because I'm a cop too.
{17510}{17567}Keep up the good work.|Ten four.
{17573}{17645}Wait. So what precinct|are you with?
{17651}{17705}I'm with the 57th.
{17711}{17790}- I know a guy in Homicide up there.|- I'm in Vice.
{17796}{17916}In fact, I'm undercover|right now. I'm a whore.
{17936}{17988}Who else is in Vice there?
{17994}{18025}Do you know...
{18031}{18075}...Sipowitz?
{18081}{18128}Sipowitz? I don't think so.
{18134}{18213}Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah.|Big guy, kind of bald.
{18219}{18287}I don't know him.
{18293}{18372}Don't try to call him.|He's not there. He's out.
{18378}{18462}His partner just died.
{18468}{18533}Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry|for his loss.
{18539}{18598}I sure will. Take care.
{18604}{18667}By the way, Sipowitz|will be all right.
{18673}{18779}That kid from "Silver Spoons"|is really good.
{18816}{18894}Where'd you find my badge?
{19111}{19192}Could you give me and Ross|a hand moving his couch?
{19198}{19282}I'd love to but I got acting class.|But you know what?
{19288}{19401}I guess I could blow that off...|...or you.
{19491}{19593}Let me ask you something.|I was talking with Monica and Chandler.
{19599}{19645}Boy, they are really tight.
{19651}{19674}I know.
{19680}{19786}That's not a bad situation|they got there.
{19786}{19869}Think I'll get me one of those.
{19910}{19955}What's up, Joe?
{19961}{20037}I think Monica and Chandler|are so great...
{20043}{20105}...because they were friends first.
{20111}{20214}So I asked myself, who are my friends?|You and Phoebe.
{20220}{20312}I saw you first, so...
{20350}{20494}- What are you saying?|- Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
{20551}{20589}You know, honey...
{20595}{20650}...as flattered as I am...
{20656}{20732}...that you saw me first...
{20738}{20857}...I just don't think we should be|cranking anything up.
{20863}{20956}I'll treat you real nice.
{21071}{21152}Yeah. Well, you know...
{21159}{21279}I think it's a great idea to become|friends with someone before you date.
{21285}{21383}But the way you do it is you|meet someone, become their friend...
{21389}{21472}...build a foundation,|then ask them out on a date.
{21478}{21574}Don't hit on your existing friends.
{21580}{21676}Won't that take longer?
{21703}{21749}Oh, but once you find it...
{21755}{21842}...it's so worth the wait.
{21858}{21886}I understand.
{21892}{21934}Good.
{21940}{22039}Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.
{22089}{22153}Come here to me.
{22164}{22256}No, no. You come here to me.
{22288}{22377}- I brought reinforcements.|- Great! You brought Joey?
{22383}{22453}The next best thing.
{22474}{22588}You brought Chandler?|The next best thing would be Monica!
{22594}{22698}I would be offended, but Monica|is freakishly strong, so...
{22704}{22762}I drew a sketch|of how we'll do it.
{22768}{22813}Rach, that's you.
{22819}{22882}That's the couch.
{22888}{22922}What's that?
{22928}{23000}That's me.
{23068}{23160}Certainly think a lot of yourself.
{23165}{23247}No. That's my arm.
{23314}{23451}I see. I thought you just really,|really liked your new couch.
{23488}{23566}Just follow my lead.
{23591}{23664}Come on, Chandler.
{23670}{23702}- All right.|- Okay.
{23708}{23760}Here we go.
{23766}{23824}All right. Ready?
{23830}{23855}Turn!
{23861}{23885}Turn!
{23891}{23939}Turn!
{23945}{24043}- I don't think we can turn anymore!|- I don't think it'll fit!
{24049}{24122}Yeah, it will.|Come on! Up, up, up!
{24128}{24180}Up! Yes!
{24186}{24245}Here we go! Pivot!
{24251}{24314}Pivot!
{24319}{24362}Pivot!
{24368}{24429}Pivot!
{24436}{24492}Pivot!
{24498}{24517}Pivot!
{24523}{24626}Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
{24693}{24751}I don't think it'll pivot anymore.
{24757}{24827}You think?
{24846}{24973}All right, let's bring it|back down and try again.
{25130}{25227}I think it's really stuck now.
{25229}{25314}- I can't believe that didn't work.|- I know. Me neither.
{25320}{25396}I mean, you had a sketch.
{25409}{25505}What did you mean when|you said "pivot"?
{25616}{25677}How's it going?|Make any new friends?
{25683}{25769}Yeah.|I met this woman.
{25794}{25832}What's she like?
{25838}{25875}Well, she's...
{25881}{25950}...really good in bed.
{25956}{26058}- You were going to be friends first.|- Hey, it's all your fault.
{26064}{26083}Why?
{26089}{26162}You didn't give me advice.|You gave me a pickup line.
{26168}{26259}I told her I wanted to|"build a foundation and be friends".
{26265}{26399}Suddenly, through no fault of my own,|I became irresistible to her!
{26405}{26472}And her roommate!
{26489}{26535}What about the "closeness"?
{26541}{26681}Closeness, schmosness! There was|three of us, for crying out loud!
{26756}{26794}Who wants pizza?
{26800}{26845}I do! I do! I do!
{26851}{26981}This is great! Can you believe|I found it on the second floor?
{27015}{27063}- Who is it?|- NYPD.
{27069}{27120}Oh, my God!
{27126}{27202}Just a minute, officer!
{27400}{27503}- I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.|- My God, it's him! It's that cop!
{27509}{27610}- I can't believe he found me!|- Are you going to go to jail?
{27616}{27721}If I go down,|you guys go down with me.
{27735}{27822}Harboring a fugitive?|That's one-to-three years minimum.
{27828}{27911}Good luck, Chandler.
{27956}{28050}Arrest me, but you'll never|make it stick and you know it.
{28056}{28135}I have no choice, it's my job.|You understand, right?
{28141}{28208}And you understand that|I'm calling my lawyer.
{28214}{28343}And once he puts you on the stand|he'll make you look like a fool!
{28351}{28403}I don't like looking foolish.
{28409}{28508}Maybe I don't arrest you today.|Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
{28514}{28577}I'd love it if I weren't here!
{28583}{28680}Since you're not going to jail tonight,|I was wondering if you'd...
{28686}{28750}...like to go to dinner with me?
{28756}{28784}Me?
{28790}{28882}Ever since you flashed my badge,|I can't stop thinking about you.
{28888}{29016}You're the prettiest fake|undercover whore I've ever seen.
{29018}{29084}Nice.
{29114}{29196}Wow, I didn't see that coming.|You're asking me out.
{29202}{29299}I could've done it better,|but they're staring at me.
{29305}{29404}I'd like to go out|with you, officer.
{29410}{29452}- Gary.|- Gary.
{29458}{29503}Okay, so it's a date.
{29509}{29572}I got to ask you, though.|How'd you find me?
{29578}{29647}I ran your fingerprints|through the computer.
{29653}{29718}This was listed|as your last known address.
{29724}{29748}Impressive.
{29754}{29870}Not as impressive as you. Your record|shows you've done some weird stuff.
{29876}{29939}We'll talk at dinner.
{29943}{30029}- So I'll come by and pick you up?|- I can't wait.
{30035}{30141}Don't worry, I won't just|take you out for doughnuts.
{30184}{30254}He has a gun!
{30374}{30498}I'd like to return this couch.|I'm not satisfied with it.
{30578}{30668}You want to return this couch?
{30674}{30755}It's cut in half.
{30759}{30888}- That's what I'm telling you.|- Did you cut this couch in half?
{30894}{30997}This couch is cut in half!
{31003}{31123}I would like to exchange it for one|that is not cut in half.
{31129}{31213}You're saying this couch was|delivered to you like this?
{31219}{31269}Look, I'm a reasonable man.
{31275}{31362}I will accept store credit.
{31368}{31501}I'll give you store credit|in the amount of four dollars.
{31549}{31622}I will take it.
{92}{161}- Good! You guys are all here.|- What's up?
{167}{246}I have a job interview|at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.
{252}{287}Congratulations!
{293}{369}Oh, boy.|That guy's underwear sucks!
{375}{394}What?
{400}{447}Well, I got this pair marked "XS".
{453}{549}Let me tell you, there was no room|for excess anything in there.
{555}{615}I'll be the coordinator|of the women's collection.
{621}{722}I'll work right under the director.|It's the perfect job for me!
{728}{781}If you nail the interview,|you'll get it.
{787}{865}You want to work|on your interview skills?
{871}{958}Let's start with the handshake.
{980}{1055}Very good handshake.|Good wrist action.
{1061}{1133}Let me try.
{1136}{1191}Oh, my God!|What did I ever do to you?
{1197}{1231}Did I squeeze too hard?
{1237}{1353}Let's just say|I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
{1396}{1476}The One with Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss
{2577}{2656}That's right, Ross.|I can see you in your new apartment.
{2662}{2751}Same as yesterday,|same as the day before.
{2757}{2799}Is he doing|his "shark attack" bit?
{2805}{2907}No. Oh, wait!|There he goes.
{3208}{3251}Very funny, Ross.
{3257}{3363}Very lifelike and funny.
{3396}{3494}No, no.|I wasn't waving at you, lady.
{3506}{3570}Whoa, maybe I was.
{3576}{3653}This hot girl in Ross' building|is flirting with me.
{3659}{3750}Get in there, man.|Flirt back. Mix it up!
{3756}{3842}Yeah, I'm down with that.
{3857}{3924}Okay, here goes.
{3930}{3967}How...
{3973}{4017}...you...
{4023}{4103}...doing?
{4124}{4206}It worked! She's waving me over.|I'll be right over.
{4212}{4303}Let's see,|she's on the third floor...
{4307}{4411}- She is pretty, huh?|- Tell me about it.
{4417}{4463}No, no! I'm not with her.
{4469}{4548}That's just Monica.
{4962}{5003}Hey, Joey!
{5009}{5074}Great stuff, huh?
{5080}{5107}This your place?
{5113}{5170}Yeah, of course it is.|Come on in.
{5176}{5293}Go by the window.|You can pretend to be surfing.
{5308}{5368}I counted.|You're not supposed to live here!
{5374}{5443}Oh, man!
{5548}{5565}What happened?
{5571}{5701}I ended up at Ross' place.|I must have miscounted or something.
{5705}{5746}Damn! She's not there anymore.
{5752}{5867}Look, Ross is doing|his "watching TV" bit.
{5901}{5998}No, Joe, I think|he's just watching TV.
{6215}{6277}{y:i}We've lost visual contact|{y:i}with the suspect.
{6283}{6346}Okay, now I really have to go.
{6352}{6419}It's so unfair that|our date has to get cut short...
{6425}{6505}...just because some guy|shot at a store clerk.
{6511}{6592}- I know, but it's my job.|- Then maybe I could come too?
{6598}{6701}{y:i}Suspect has just emerged|{y:i}naked from the sewer.
{6707}{6772}All right, you go.
{6952}{7001}Oh, God!
{7007}{7093}Oh, I just miss him so much!
{7169}{7214}For just a week,|you guys are close.
{7220}{7296}Yeah, it's weird.|I can't help it. He's so sweet.
{7302}{7364}He's like this little|puppy dog, you know?
{7370}{7474}But like a really tough one|who shoots bad guys.
{7480}{7554}I love the beginning parts|of relationships.
{7560}{7612}You can't keep your hands|off each other.
{7618}{7691}I know. It is the best.
{7697}{7781}How long did that last|for you and Chandler?
{7787}{7852}What? It's still going on.
{7858}{7920}Come on, seriously.|When did it end?
{7926}{8024}I am serious. We're all over|each other all the time.
{8030}{8112}Okay, you know where you are|better than I do.
{8118}{8190}Why don't you just calm down?
{8196}{8336}Get all your facts before you tell|everybody you're the only hot couple.
{8342}{8416}God, I woke the beast.
{8422}{8507}I was wrong obviously.|I just misspoke. It's okay.
{8513}{8545}It is okay.
{8551}{8630}As long as you know Chandler and I|are also hot and fiery.
{8636}{8667}Just as hot as you.
{8673}{8702}I mean, our flame...
{8708}{8799}It is on fire!
{8806}{8880}Here's your broom back.
{8898}{8978}You are so cute!
{9133}{9163}How'd the interview go?
{9169}{9262}Horrible! I did the stupidest,|most embarrassing thing.
{9268}{9399}Did you say you wanted to have sex|with his wife then fall off your chair?
{9411}{9441}So what happened?
{9447}{9522}It was horrible!|And the interview part went so well.
{9528}{9562}I even made him laugh.
{9568}{9621}He said something about a boat...
{9627}{9778}...and I was like, "Well, yeah,|if you've got enough life jackets."
{9823}{9899}Trust me.|It was actually very funny.
{9905}{9987}Anyway, we were|saying goodbye and...
{9993}{10017}What happened?
{10023}{10062}We were shaking hands...
{10068}{10116}{y:i}... and he leaned in toward me.
{10122}{10169}{y:i}Maybe he was opening the door...
{10175}{10293}{y:i}... but I totally|{y:i}misread him and I...
{10428}{10471}You kissed him?
{10477}{10538}I didn't know what else to do!
{10544}{10581}You could have tried...
{10587}{10639}...not kissing him.
{10645}{10666}Thanks, Chandler.
{10672}{10762}A guy from Ralph Lauren called.|You got a second interview.
{10768}{10825}I can't believe it!|I got a second interview.
{10831}{10909}That kiss isn't looking like|such a mistake now, is it?
{10915}{10979}You don't think that's|why he wants me back?
{10985}{11034}Yeah!
{11040}{11090}No?
{11096}{11141}What are you talking about?
{11147}{11206}I accidentally kissed him|in the interview...
{11212}{11254}...and now he wants me back...
{11260}{11392}...because, "Let's bring back|the girl who kisses everybody!"
{11396}{11420}Come on, Rach.
{11426}{11511}What if he thinks|I'll just sleep with him?
{11517}{11569}He wants you back because|you're right for the job.
{11575}{11666}Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!|How could I be so stupid?
{11672}{11767}Rachel, don't say that. I think|you just need a hug from Joey.
{11773}{11842}Come on. Come on.
{11848}{11905}She's back! Hot girl's back!
{11911}{11999}Well, I'm not totally back yet.|But I appreciate it.
{12005}{12072}No. In Ross' building.|She's back!
{12078}{12129}Wait there.|I'll be over in a second.
{12135}{12208}One, two, three...|Got it!
{12288}{12367}I gotta check out this hot girl.
{12373}{12448}There she is!
{12597}{12661}Damn it! Did you move?
{12667}{12707}Yes.
{12713}{12829}I lived with you for a while.|Then I found this place.
{12859}{12942}I'm Ross.
{13257}{13353}Do you happen to have|a hot girl in there?
{13377}{13412}No, I'm all alone.
{13418}{13500}Yeah. Sorry about that.
{13646}{13682}Hey, little girl.
{13688}{13814}Is your mommy or sister or babysitter|by any chance, a hot girl?
{13820}{13841}Daddy!
{13847}{13920}Later, girl!
{14008}{14085}Oh, man!
{14112}{14193}Hot girl?
{14200}{14278}Hot girl!
{14360}{14437}Hi, Rachel. Come on in.
{14443}{14538}- It's nice to see you again.|- Thank you.
{14602}{14664}What?
{14668}{14691}Excuse me?
{14697}{14729}Yeah, let me...
{14735}{14813}Okay, I see what's going on here.|Now, look...
{14819}{14875}...I'm sorry if I gave you|the wrong impression.
{14881}{14977}But I am not some hussy who will|just sleep around to get ahead.
{14983}{15068}Even though I kissed you,|that does not give you...
{15074}{15189}...the right to demand sex from me!|I do not want this job that bad.
{15195}{15252}Good day, sir.
{15382}{15434}You are not gonna believe...
{15440}{15542}...what that sleazeball|from Ralph Lauren did to me!
{15602}{15702}Okay, that's amazing!|How did you know that?
{15708}{15776}You got ink on your lip.
{15992}{16060}What do you say, maybe,|sometime I hold your gun?
{16066}{16115}We're not supposed to do that.
{16121}{16213}What could happen? I mean...
{16218}{16296}Yeah. I'm gonna say no.
{16302}{16422}- Do you want to see a movie tonight?|- We can't. We already have plans.
{16428}{16457}What are you doing?
{16463}{16569}Well, same thing we did all day.|Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
{16575}{16684}He is so amazing.|We never left the bedroom.
{16703}{16783}But have fun at the movie.
{16790}{16860}Well, we're not seeing a movie.
{16866}{16939}Then why did you ask us|if we wanted to go?
{16945}{17014}Because I just wanted|to know what you were doing...
{17020}{17092}...so you wouldn't walk in|on me and Chandler...
{17098}{17183}...while we were doing it all night.
{17189}{17266}Will you excuse me?
{17340}{17438}Chandler?|Can I see you for a second?
{17477}{17543}- We have got to beat them!|- Why?
{17549}{17649}Because Gary and Phoebe think|they're a hotter couple than us.
{17655}{17701}So?
{17707}{17806}So we've gotta go have a lot of sex|and prove them wrong!
{17812}{17891}You've got to stop this|competitive thing. It's crazy.
{17897}{17994}Just to impress them, you want us|to have sex over and over...
{18000}{18108}...and I'm saying no to this, why?|Get your coat!
{18397}{18462}Excuse me.
{18528}{18593}You should check this out.|Tell the other tenants.
{18599}{18713}Apparently, he's looking|for some kind of hot girl.
{18743}{18806}Who isn't?
{18926}{18997}I don't think we've met.|I'm Ross.
{19003}{19122}I know. You're the guy who|wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
{19128}{19174}Never mind.
{19180}{19266}I actually thought it was unfair|the way everyone reacted.
{19272}{19322}I mean, you had just moved in.
{19328}{19383}I had just moved in!
{19389}{19447}Thank you!
{19453}{19500}Listen...
{19506}{19544}Jen.
{19550}{19664}I know this may sound a little...
{19687}{19787}But would you want to grab|a cup of coffee sometime?
{19793}{19872}Sure, that would be nice.
{19893}{19966}My number's on there.|Give me a call.
{19972}{20023}I will give you a call.
{20029}{20108}- I'll see you later.|- Okay.
{20194}{20278}I forgot my paper.
{20375}{20420}That was amazing.
{20426}{20532}Phoebe and Gary are so gonna|hear about this at dinner.
{20538}{20600}That was amazing.
{20606}{20659}We are the hottest, huh?
{20665}{20726}No one is hotter than we are.
{20732}{20817}- We're the best.|- No, you're the best.
{20823}{20900}- No, you're the best.|- No, you're the best.
{20906}{20988}I am the best.
{21010}{21046}Hey, guys.
{21052}{21122}What you been doing?
{21240}{21287}Isn't that the girl who waved at you?
{21293}{21398}I don't know, but I can|see through your sheet.
{21428}{21464}Yeah, that's her.
{21470}{21540}You know, it doesn't matter.|I'll never meet her.
{21546}{21599}It's impossible to find her apartment!
{21605}{21707}She lives in some hot-girl|parallel universe or something.
{21713}{21756}What are you talking about?
{21762}{21836}She lives on the 2nd floor,|7th apartment from the left.
{21842}{21932}No, she lives on the 3rd floor,|8th apartment from the left.
{21938}{22015}No. Those first two windows,|that's the lobby.
{22021}{22104}That other window is the stairway.|You've been counting wrong.
{22110}{22184}I did not know that!|Thank you, Monica.
{22190}{22296}I almost lost another girl|because of counting!
{22333}{22427}- So, you ready?|- Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
{22433}{22528}- Could you get that?|- Sure.
{22711}{22789}No! No!
{22920}{23006}First, I would like to say|thank you for seeing me again.
{23012}{23040}That's all right.
{23046}{23190}But I feel obligated to tell you|that this meeting is being videotaped.
{23282}{23392}Well, first, I would like to start|by apologizing for kissing you...
{23398}{23452}...and for yelling at you.
{23458}{23490}Fair enough.
{23496}{23656}Now, you're probably going to hire|one of the people who did not...
{23675}{23732}...yell at you and storm out.
{23738}{23804}And I think that's a big mistake.|And here's why.
{23810}{23926}I made a huge fool of myself,|and I came back. That shows courage.
{23932}{24028}When I thought you wanted sex|in exchange for this job, I said no.
{24034}{24070}That shows integrity.
{24076}{24142}And I was not afraid|to stand up for myself...
{24148}{24238}...and that shows courage.
{24261}{24338}Now, I know that I've|already said courage...
{24344}{24427}...but you've got to have courage.
{24433}{24545}And finally, when I thought|you were making sexual advances...
{24551}{24603}...I said no,|and I was not litigious.
{24609}{24659}So there you go!|You got courage...
{24665}{24752}...you got integrity,|you got courage again...
{24758}{24856}...and not litigious.
{24861}{24924}Look, Mr...
{24930}{24960}Zelner.
{24966}{24991}I knew that!
{24997}{25074}Oh, I knew that.
{25080}{25130}I really, really want this job.
{25136}{25269}And I think I would be|really good at it.
{25313}{25383}You know what?
{25386}{25461}I may regret this...
{25467}{25507}...but I'll give you a shot.
{25513}{25536}You are?
{25542}{25584}Really?
{25590}{25650}Thank you. Oh, God!
{25656}{25755}Would it be inappropriate|if I gave you a hug?
{25766}{25837}Well, how about a handshake?
{25843}{25911}Oh, God! I'm sorry!
{25925}{26015}I did not mean to touch that!|I mean, you!
{26021}{26097}There!
{26097}{26185}I'm gonna leave.|Thank you very much.
{26191}{26269}Hey, I'll see you Monday.
{26350}{26372}Are you tired?
{26378}{26449}You better believe he's tired|after the day we had!
{26455}{26532}If you know what I mean.|Do you know what I mean?
{26538}{26642}Honey? The tortilla chips|know what you mean.
{26652}{26694}Do you like that badge I got you?
{26700}{26778}Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
{26787}{26903}Now, I gotta go.|Officer Bing's got a 10-100.
{26918}{26993}That's pee-pee.
{27043}{27142}Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.
{27176}{27244}We kind of took a detour|on our way over here.
{27250}{27344}We were strolling through the park|and no one was around, so...
{27350}{27411}- You didn't.|- We did!
{27417}{27554}We violated section 12,|paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
{27593}{27663}The park, huh?
{27668}{27723}Public place.
{27729}{27843}I hear you.|Can you excuse me for a second?
{28023}{28062}Hi, Chandler.
{28068}{28144}Monica, this is the men's room.
{28150}{28223}Isn't it?
{28233}{28270}Yes, it is.
{28276}{28361}But see, I've always found|the men's bathroom very sexual.
{28367}{28393}Haven't you?
{28399}{28430}No.
{28436}{28517}And if I did, I don't think|we'd be going out.
{28523}{28567}This is getting ridiculous.
{28573}{28637}Come on, we can't let them win!
{28643}{28748}We've proved that we are hot, okay?|So why are you obsessed about this?
{28754}{28796}Phoebe and Gary are in that...
{28802}{28862}..."can't keep their hands|off each other" phase!
{28868}{28907}So?
{28913}{29012}It makes me really sad that|we're not really there anymore.
{29018}{29120}Oh, is that what|this has all been about?
{29132}{29199}Wasn't it a lot more exciting|when we were...
{29205}{29259}...all over each other all the time?
{29265}{29343}Yeah, that was great.|That was really great.
{29349}{29436}But the truth is, I'm more|excited about where we are now.
{29442}{29485}- Really?|- Yeah.
{29491}{29570}I've never been in a relationship|this long before.
{29576}{29659}To get past the beginning and|still want to be around each other?
{29665}{29707}I think that's incredible.
{29713}{29785}And the fact that|this is happening with you...
{29791}{29879}...I think that's pretty exciting.
{29952}{30033}That's so sweet.
{30034}{30117}I know that I was acting|a little crazy...
{30123}{30213}...but I feel the same way.
{30301}{30340}You know what I just realized?
{30346}{30406}You just freaked out|about our relationship.
{30412}{30445}- I did not.|- Yes, you did!
{30451}{30511}Admit it. You freaked out!
{30517}{30551}I freaked out a little.
{30557}{30622}A little?|You freaked out bigtime, okay?
{30628}{30675}And I fixed it!|We have switched places.
{30681}{30841}I am the relationship king, and you|are the crazy, irrational screwup!
{30917}{30993}And now we're back.
{31205}{31267}I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
{31273}{31339}Thank God!|I can't watch him anymore.
{31345}{31377}You guys ready?
{31383}{31503}By the way, thank you for|loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
{31511}{31618}Man, they cannot get enough!
{78}{120}Pick a card.
{126}{190}All right. Now, memorize it.
{196}{257}- You got it?|- Oh, yes.
{263}{333}Is that your card?
{495}{572}- Hey, guys.|- Hi there!
{578}{665}Guess what?|Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.
{671}{713}What are you talking about?
{719}{756}It's not for sure.
{762}{837}We met this guy in the park|who thought Ben was cute.
{843}{916}You know, which he is.|He gave us his card...
{922}{1044}...and told us to bring him|for this commercial he's auditioning.
{1058}{1135}The biggest commercial|casting director in town!
{1141}{1256}Ben takes one lousy walk|in the park and gets an audition?
{1292}{1383}I mean, way to go, Ben!
{1400}{1495}I've been there a million times|and no one's offered me an audition.
{1501}{1561}It's crazy. We were pushing|Ben on the swings...
{1567}{1646}I'm always on the swings!
{1652}{1710}What am I doing wrong?
{1716}{1772}That.
{1793}{1871}The One Where Rachel Smokes
{2982}{3049}- Gotta go. Wish me luck.|- Good luck.
{3055}{3131}Since you work at Ralph Lauren,|can you get me some shirts?
{3137}{3275}I don't know if I'd feel comfortable|stealing on my very first day.
{3281}{3334}Unwilling to steal from work.
{3340}{3376}Interesting.
{3382}{3439}If anybody gets free stuff,|it's me.
{3445}{3516}Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.
{3522}{3562}Go get 'em!
{3568}{3619}Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.
{3625}{3678}I say we throw|a surprise party this weekend.
{3684}{3739}But her birthday's|not for another month.
{3745}{3859}If we throw a party on her birthday,|it's not a surprise.
{3866}{3951}Great! We can have a dinner party|and invite her close friends.
{3957}{4040}Ross! We're having|a surprise party for Rachel.
{4046}{4108}Done.
{4119}{4166}Great. Wanna do it together?
{4172}{4248}I'd love to do it together!
{4315}{4372}They're gonna do it together.
{4378}{4407}That's my girlfriend.
{4413}{4489}So I gotta shut it down now?
{4513}{4563}I gotta go.|I'm picking up Ben...
{4569}{4626}...and then we're off|to the big audition.
{4632}{4715}It'll be weird seeing some actor|pretending to be Ben's dad.
{4721}{4806}Weirder than his two moms making out?
{4825}{4880}Dad? There's a dad|in the commercial?
{4886}{4964}Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup|and pretend to enjoy it.
{4970}{5036}Maybe I'll go with you|and audition as the dad.
{5042}{5101}Who better to play Ben's dad|than his godfather?
{5107}{5192}- You're not his godfather.|- What?
{5198}{5268}Are you kidding?
{5281}{5343}Of course I am.
{5356}{5463}- Okay, let's go, godfather.|- All right!
{5620}{5651}They'll let me audition!
{5657}{5691}Really? That's great!
{5697}{5775}One of the casting ladies|has actually seen me in a play.
{5781}{5862}So I steered clear of her.
{5867}{5914}- That kid looks familiar.|- Oh, yeah.
{5920}{6014}He's done tons of commercials:|Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...
{6020}{6061}...and for the phone company.
{6067}{6162}He was so good, he convinced me|to switch phone companies.
{6168}{6238}Chandler was mad.
{6244}{6331}He's not gonna get this one.|Ben is way cuter than that kid.
{6337}{6402}I mean, look at him.
{6535}{6557}That's great.
{6563}{6629}Wouldn't it be great|if I got to play Ben's dad?
{6635}{6700}You look nothing like Ben.
{6706}{6797}I look more like him than you do.
{6814}{6932}I really don't know you|well enough for you to do that.
{7016}{7109}So it's down to these two.|Nancy, I know you like this one.
{7115}{7177}I think I agree.|Rachel, what do you think?
{7183}{7240}Well, that one is pretty...
{7246}{7306}...but I just love this fabric.
{7312}{7331}Sorry.
{7337}{7406}Don't be. Part of your job|is to give your opinions.
{7412}{7477}Then I take credit for them.|I'm kidding!
{7483}{7561}She is kidding. But don't ever|disagree with her again.
{7567}{7612}Okay, now I'm kidding!
{7618}{7695}What a fun office.
{7701}{7780}I don't know which one.|But I do know I need a cigarette.
{7786}{7912}Let's take a break, go outside|and sort this out when we return.
{7985}{8011}- You smoke?|- No.
{8017}{8144}My dad's a doctor. And he would|always tell me horror stories...
{8201}{8285}About ghosts and goblins...
{8291}{8414}...who totally supported|the princess's right to smoke.
{8525}{8621}Then they came back from smoking|and they'd made all of the decisions.
{8627}{8663}- That's not fair.|- I know.
{8669}{8756}It's like I'm being punished|for not having this disgusting habit.
{8762}{8840}Yeah, it is the best.
{8843}{8881}What if this keeps happening?
{8887}{8941}They'll be smoking,|making the decisions...
{8947}{9051}...and I'll be up in my office|breathing in my stupid clean air.
{9057}{9114}And when Kim wants|to promote one of us...
{9120}{9218}...who do you think she'll pick?|Me or Smokey Smokerson?
{9224}{9360}You can go down there and not smoke.|Say you want some fresh air.
{9366}{9406}I could do that.
{9412}{9507}Or you could do|the easy thing and smoke.
{9517}{9556}Do you wanna go get coffee?
{9562}{9607}- I would love to.|- Oh, good.
{9613}{9643}I'm gonna go too.
{9649}{9712}Oh, good.
{9728}{9807}Oh, I changed my mind.
{9845}{9922}Let's talk about the party.|I have so many ideas.
{9928}{9997}Me too!
{9998}{10072}Oh, look at that.
{10093}{10161}This is a little sketch|of the cake. See?
{10167}{10204}Some sample menus.
{10210}{10281}I thought we'd start with|a Tuscan-style finger food.
{10287}{10381}And for music, here's an|alphabetized list of all of my CDs.
{10387}{10472}I've highlighted the ones|that'll go with the food.
{10478}{10579}- What about the dinner party?|- We're not doing that.
{10612}{10709}Looks like you took care of|everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.
{10715}{10806}Wait a minute. There's plenty|of things for you to do.
{10812}{10865}Like what?
{10871}{10930}Cups.
{10930}{10980}You're giving me cups?
{10986}{11037}And ice.
{11043}{11120}Cups and ice? I get to be|in charge of cups and ice?
{11126}{11172}All right.
{11178}{11252}Fine. I will be|in charge of cups and ice.
{11258}{11347}- I can get ice at the restaurant...|- I got it!
{11413}{11499}- How did the audition go?|- Not so good.
{11505}{11581}Wait a minute.|Are you doing Joey's...
{11587}{11718}..."The audition didn't go so well.|Yeah, it did!"
{11728}{11784}Yeah, I am!
{11813}{11876}- Yeah, Ben got a second audition.|- Oh, great!
{11882}{12010}I had to teach Ross my bit because|I actually didn't get a callback.
{12016}{12107}You got a callback too, didn't you?
{12118}{12202}Yeah, I did!
{12310}{12350}What are you doing out here?
{12356}{12457}It got kind of lonely up there,|so I thought I would come out here...
{12463}{12522}...and get some fresh air.
{12528}{12571}We're discussing the fall collection.
{12577}{12597}Oh, great.
{12603}{12637}Anyway, we really...
{12643}{12712}- Sorry. We're smoking all over you.|- That's okay.
{12718}{12772}We'll move. You stay there.
{12778}{12851}I sent the designs to Ralph.|He was excited about it.
{12857}{12937}That's great!|You are the best!
{12943}{12994}Excuse me.|Can I bum one of those?
{13000}{13067}Actually, this one's...
{13122}{13164}What's so funny over here?
{13170}{13213}I thought you didn't smoke.
{13219}{13367}You know, I thought you guys|meant marijuana cigarettes.
{13367}{13443}You know what I mean?|Doobies?
{13458}{13532}Actually, I thought to myself,|"Those guys are crazy!"
{13538}{13616}But no, I smoke the|regular ones all the time.
{13622}{13684}We get high.
{13711}{13779}Me too.
{13785}{13834}I'm kidding.
{13840}{13917}Me too.
{13946}{14031}Oh, God! This is so nerve-racking.|How do you do this?
{14037}{14123}Fortunately, I don't get|many callbacks so...
{14129}{14194}Is it a good sign that|they asked us to wait?
{14200}{14272}Who knows?
{14303}{14402}We have narrowed it down|to Raymond, Ben, Kyle...
{14408}{14462}...and Joey.|The rest of you, thank you.
{14468}{14557}Yes! I knew it!
{14558}{14610}Bye-bye.
{14616}{14676}So long.
{14682}{14748}Later.
{14758}{14835}This is great!|I might get to play Ben's dad.
{14841}{14876}That can't happen.
{14882}{14930}Because you have|such different looks...
{14936}{15006}...we're putting you with Raymond|and Kyle with Ben.
{15012}{15113}So it'll either be|you two or you two.
{15177}{15249}- This is gonna be kind of weird.|- Yeah, it is.
{15255}{15352}Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
{15363}{15486}No. We're like best friends.|That's why it's weird.
{15492}{15582}I thought we were just talking.
{15742}{15826}Is it okay if I leave this here|till Rachel's birthday party?
{15832}{15917}- Sure. What's in them?|- Cups.
{15923}{16038}Good, because we got Rachel|800 gallons of water.
{16044}{16076}That's a lot of cups.
{16082}{16126}I'm in charge of cups and ice.
{16132}{16261}And Monica's gonna rue the day|she put me in charge of cups and ice.
{16268}{16382}You know, I rued the day once.|Didn't get a whole lot else done.
{16388}{16497}Okay, time to bring up|the rest of the cups.
{16598}{16644}Ross, I'm glad you're here.
{16650}{16752}- I want to talk to you.|- What's up?
{16758}{16845}I've been thinking about this|commercial thing. Me against Ben.
{16851}{16972}The two of us competing.|That can't lead to anything good.
{16978}{17137}I think I'm just gonna step aside.|I'll tell them that I won't audition.
{17162}{17263}Joey, that's great.|Thanks, man.
{17348}{17405}That's it?
{17414}{17497}You're gonna let me do this?|It's my career we're talking about!
{17503}{17522}But you just...
{17528}{17608}I said that so|you wouldn't let Ben do it.
{17614}{17673}If anyone should step aside,|it should be Ben.
{17679}{17754}- What?|- Chandler, tell him!
{17790}{17884}Well, let me get the door first.
{17893}{17972}Hi, no one!
{18018}{18058}Why should Ben step aside?
{18064}{18146}It was his audition in the|first place. You tagged along.
{18152}{18212}You're like the tag-along dad!
{18218}{18269}I care about his feelings.
{18275}{18294}What?
{18300}{18372}You know how hard it'll be on him|when he doesn't get it?
{18378}{18432}And why wouldn't he get it?
{18438}{18475}Come on!
{18481}{18564}Have you seen what my kid can do?
{18570}{18632}He dials phones,|he eats tortilla chips.
{18638}{18717}He plays soccer|with the cartoon tiger!
{18723}{18811}Are you saying your kid eats soup|better than my kid?
{18817}{18881}You just give him a spoon, baby.
{18887}{18943}Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see!
{18949}{18997}This commercial belongs|to me and Mitch!
{19003}{19122}- Your kid's name is Raymond!|- Yeah? So is yours!
{19212}{19261}- How did work go?|- It was great.
{19267}{19341}I went down there like you said.|And we talked business.
{19347}{19391}And Kim took my opinions.
{19397}{19463}You stink!
{19473}{19528}- Thanks.|- No, I'm serious.
{19534}{19587}Because I went down|and they were smoking.
{19593}{19672}This is actually the smell of success.
{19678}{19726}But there's something different.
{19732}{19808}Oh, my God! You smoked!
{19808}{19829}I did not.
{19835}{19927}Yes, you did. You look|happy and sick. You smoked!
{19933}{20022}All right, fine! But I had to.|I had to do it for my career.
{20028}{20109}I wish I had to smoke for my career.
{20115}{20157}That's so gross!
{20163}{20206}It's not that bad, you know?
{20212}{20332}Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy|and my fingers sort of smell.
{20338}{20411}I actually feel like I could throw up.
{20417}{20567}But you gotta push past this, okay?|Because it's about to get so good.
{20603}{20677}You smell so smoky,|I gotta get up.
{20683}{20725}I'm not kidding.
{20731}{20809}I think you smell great.
{20908}{20972}So we're decided.|No on plaid, yes on pink.
{20978}{21015}Absolutely.
{21021}{21107}I'm so onboard.
{21135}{21181}- Didn't you just light that?|- Yeah.
{21187}{21214}But you know what?
{21220}{21307}I'm just really, really|trying to cut back, you know.
{21313}{21387}Good luck, Rach.
{21403}{21446}I've been thinking about quitting.
{21452}{21509}Every Sunday night,|I say I'm quitting.
{21515}{21565}Every Monday morning, it's like...
{21571}{21597}Tell me about it.
{21603}{21672}We'll just quit.|Let's all quit!
{21678}{21704}It sounds appealing.
{21710}{21774}- I never could do it.|- But you could. Absolutely.
{21780}{21850}We can help each other.|We could get those patches.
{21856}{21912}We could be like the Patch Sisters.
{21918}{22001}You know, we really should quit.|Okay, let's quit!
{22007}{22056}Great! Give me those cigs.|Come on!
{22062}{22150}Give it! Out. Done. Quit.
{22174}{22272}My late husband gave me that lighter.
{22281}{22326}I'm not kidding.
{22332}{22404}Okay, then.
{22432}{22501}Mmm... soup.
{22507}{22593}Mmm... soup.
{22667}{22764}Would you mind watching Ben for me|while I use the ladies' room?
{22770}{22834}- No problem.|- Thanks.
{23111}{23202}So you want to be an actor?|I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.
{23208}{23287}There's tons of rejection.|No stability.
{23293}{23387}I mean, one day,|you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.
{23393}{23507}The next day, you're eating|ketchup out of the bottle.
{23721}{23802}I mean, Ben. Ben.
{23802}{23874}Raymond, Joey, you're up.
{23988}{24104}All right, let's try one.|Whenever you guys are ready.
{24127}{24151}Is there a problem?
{24157}{24255}Well, this is noodle soup.|And I've been working with tomato.
{24261}{24311}But that's okay. No problem.
{24317}{24367}Mmm... noodle soup.
{24373}{24461}You know, that's fine.|But the line is, "Mmm... soup".
{24467}{24564}- What'd I say?|- Mmm... noodle soup.
{24585}{24646}How's that different?
{24767}{24861}All right. Let's try one.
{24910}{24934}Mmm...
{24940}{25022}...noodle soup.
{25083}{25150}Let's do it again.
{25213}{25267}Mmm... soup.
{25273}{25321}I mean, noodle soup.|I mean, soup!
{25327}{25383}Come on!
{25416}{25469}You know what?|We need to move on.
{25475}{25523}No, I could do it one more time.
{25529}{25554}Look.
{25560}{25612}Mmm... noodle soup.
{25618}{25686}Damn it!
{25947}{25990}Busted!
{25996}{26100}Come on! What are you doing?|I thought we were the Patch Sisters.
{26106}{26180}That didn't work out.
{26197}{26249}We tried to quit.|But it was too hard.
{26255}{26337}If you started smoking again,|you could have at least told me.
{26343}{26402}Give me one.|What are we talking about?
{26408}{26442}Don't you give up.
{26448}{26517}That's why we didn't tell you,|and we won't drag you down.
{26523}{26572}Wait. No, no.|Drag me down.
{26578}{26644}We're so proud|of how well you're doing.
{26650}{26726}I won't let you blow it.|If I catch you, you're fired.
{26732}{26822}Go on, get out of here.|I don't want you breathing this stuff.
{26828}{26896}So, okay. You'll come with me|on the Paris trip?
{26902}{26982}Oh, man!
{27058}{27143}Check it out.|Cup hat, cup banner...
{27149}{27262}...cup chandelier and the thing|that started it all. The cup!
{27268}{27334}Great job with the cups.
{27346}{27432}Why don't you just go out with her?
{27446}{27487}Did you notice the ice? Look!
{27493}{27637}We have it all. We have crushed,|cubed and dry. Watch.
{27663}{27732}Mystical.
{27818}{27897}No one's eating my food.|They're eating her snow cones!
{27903}{27983}There are snow cones?
{28028}{28096}- Go, go!|- Thank you.
{28135}{28210}- Look, look!|- Surprise!
{28216}{28306}What? My birthday is not|for another month.
{28312}{28384}That's the surprise.
{28390}{28487}Oh, my God, you guys!|This is so great! It's so unexpected.
{28493}{28607}I mean, Chandler's birthday's|even before mine.
{28657}{28733}Surprise!
{28775}{28861}This is so great!|Look at all these...
{28867}{28887}...cups.
{28893}{28946}This is so weird.
{28952}{28997}I was in charge of cups.
{29003}{29087}Oh, okay. Not so weird.
{29178}{29279}Listen, man. I'm sorry|the audition didn't go well.
{29285}{29317}Yeah, right.
{29323}{29387}No, really. I am, Joey.|I feel bad.
{29393}{29477}Look, Ross.|You don't have to, okay?
{29483}{29523}It's not your fault I suck.
{29529}{29652}What kind of an actor can't even say,|"Mmm... noodle soup"?
{29728}{29842}You know what? Maybe you didn't|mess up your audition because you suck.
{29848}{29977}Maybe you messed up because|you care more about your godson.
{29983}{30009}What do you mean?
{30015}{30062}I think, subconsciously...
{30068}{30142}You lost me.
{30210}{30304}I think, on some level,|you sabotaged...
{30310}{30442}...your own audition|so Ben would get the part.
{30475}{30567}Your way sounds|a lot better than mine.
{30600}{30657}It's not that I'm a bad actor.
{30663}{30759}No, it's just that I care|so damn much about little Ben...
{30765}{30844}...that it was more important|for me to see him succeed.
{30850}{30911}- There you go. Thank you.|- Thank you.
{30917}{30959}- So did he get it?|- No.
{30965}{31032}What are you gonna do?
{31150}{31228}Is Rachel Greene here?|I'm meeting her for lunch.
{31234}{31304}She doesn't come down anymore.|You'll find her on 10.
{31310}{31357}Okay, great.
{31363}{31416}So we talked|about the presentation.
{31422}{31486}He wondered if one person|would be enough.
{31492}{31580}And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."
{31678}{31761}I'll catch you guys later.
{73}{116}Okay, guys, listen.
{122}{182}Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.
{188}{255}So try to really keep|Ross' mind off of it.
{261}{292}Good idea.
{298}{361}Hey, man. What's up?
{367}{469}Just thinking about Emily|getting married tomorrow.
{479}{577}Oh, Ross! Look, look!
{591}{611}What? Where?
{617}{707}Right over there! There!|Look, look, look!
{713}{803}- What am I looking at?|- Somebody help me out here.
{809}{870}Hey!
{873}{944}Monica, sorry I didn't come by.|I was out with Gary.
{950}{1056}He let me ride around with him.|We saw and prevented crimes.
{1062}{1111}You got to go on a ride-along?
{1117}{1175}- I want to go on a ride-along!|- Me too!
{1181}{1222}- Okay.|- Yeah! Me too!
{1228}{1300}Really? You?
{1322}{1367}Yeah.
{1373}{1459}- Well, it's kind of dangerous.|- Well, I like danger.
{1465}{1551}- Okay, you guys free tonight?|- Yeah!
{1557}{1663}You didn't say|it was gonna be at nighttime.
{1669}{1749}The One with the Ride-Along
{2941}{3007}I'm glad you're home.|We can finally organize these photos.
{3013}{3060}Oh, thank God!
{3066}{3123}Finally!
{3129}{3187}I've broken them down|into categories.
{3193}{3261}We got holidays,|birthdays, candids...
{3267}{3322}And I've cross-referenced|them by subject.
{3328}{3377}So if you're looking up, say...
{3383}{3452}...birthdays and dogs,|you get photo 152.
{3458}{3517}See?
{3523}{3582}Oh, it's me and LePoo.
{3588}{3634}Wow, I miss that dog.
{3640}{3747}You can also find him|under "dog" and "dead".
{3768}{3800}Great. Thanks.
{3806}{3923}Hand me that other box of photos.|That's the last one.
{4028}{4067}Oops.
{4073}{4099}Sorry.
{4105}{4149}Good thing you numbered them.
{4155}{4177}I hadn't.
{4183}{4287}Photo 152 was a prototype.
{4287}{4337}Honey, it's okay. It's okay.
{4343}{4425}How about I fix you a drink?|Maybe a margarita?
{4431}{4472}Ross has the blender.
{4478}{4582}Everything's just falling apart.
{4588}{4644}It's okay. I'll go to Ross',|get the blender.
{4650}{4709}- You get the margarita stuff ready.|- All right.
{4715}{4782}His keys are in the drawer.|Also, I need some cash.
{4788}{4821}Want me to stop at the ATM?
{4827}{4943}No. While you're at Ross',|if you see any lying around.
{4955}{4997}What?
{5003}{5088}I don't do that.
{5288}{5379}That was so cool, man.|The way you leaned on that guy.
{5385}{5456}It is starting to get dark out there.
{5462}{5526}He told you everything.|You cracked him.
{5532}{5621}He was the victim.|They're usually pretty talkative.
{5627}{5731}Okay, but it is officially nighttime.
{5737}{5810}- Want me to grab the berry?|- It's called a cherry.
{5816}{5896}It's called...|Chandler!
{5993}{6047}Okay, I got it.
{6053}{6128}This place makes the|best sandwich in the world.
{6134}{6176}Does it have meatballs?
{6182}{6203}Oh, yeah.
{6209}{6250}Melted cheese and marinara sauce?
{6256}{6283}Yep.
{6289}{6369}You can't eat that in my car.
{6387}{6427}Yeah, okay.
{6433}{6526}Even though my tax dollars|paid for this car.
{6532}{6617}Your tax dollars?
{6636}{6708}Yeah, okay.
{6840}{6888}Wow, that sandwich smells good.
{6894}{6959}Did I say you could smell it?
{6965}{6999}I can't smell it?
{7005}{7117}Half the taste is in the smell.|You're sucking up all the taste units.
{7123}{7213}Okay, I'll give them back.
{7251}{7328}What is so great about that sandwich?
{7336}{7417}Imagine the best sex you ever had.
{7423}{7478}- Are you thinking about Monica?|- Yeah.
{7484}{7544}What's that like?
{7828}{7904}Please don't be from a real dinosaur.|Please, please.
{7910}{7988}Please, please.
{8000}{8093}"Made in Mexico."|Yes!
{8107}{8195}Who would buy this?
{8337}{8414}{y:i}Rach, it's me. Pick up!
{8442}{8465}What's up?
{8471}{8518}{y:i}I need more margarita things.
{8524}{8668}I need some salt,|some margarita mix and tequila.
{8683}{8721}So all we had was ice?
{8727}{8797}See if he has ice.
{9098}{9122}{y:i}Hello, Ross?
{9128}{9162}{y:i}It's Emily here.
{9168}{9265}{y:i}I know this is out of the blue,|{y:i}but I'm getting married tomorrow.
{9271}{9317}{y:i}Well, maybe I am...
{9323}{9381}{y:i}I keep thinking about you.
{9387}{9475}{y:i}And I'm wondering if we made|{y:i}a mistake giving up so fast.
{9481}{9526}{y:i}Are you thinking about me?
{9532}{9615}{y:i}No, of course you're not.|{y:i}But if you are, call me tonight.
{9621}{9698}{y:i}Okay, bye.
{9885}{9905}Where we going?
{9911}{9991}This witness won't return my calls.|We'll surprise him coming home.
{9997}{10090}Surprise him? We're not gonna|make anybody mad, are we?
{10096}{10134}Come on, man.
{10140}{10242}You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes|a bit before he lawyers up?
{10248}{10347}He's a witness, not a perp.|And no one talks like that.
{10348}{10407}Yeah. No one talks like that.
{10413}{10502}- Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?|- I'm more cop than you two.
{10508}{10546}How do you figure that?
{10552}{10619}I'm in the front seat, okay?
{10625}{10680}I'm Gary's partner.
{10686}{10749}When you say "partner",|it doesn't sound cop.
{10755}{10833}It sounds gay.
{10843}{10908}Jealous.
{10913}{11014}- Hey, we're undercover here.|- Oh, yeah. No problem.
{11020}{11087}- Ross!|- Sorry.
{11093}{11157}There.
{11195}{11237}Hey, Gary. Who am I?
{11243}{11320}Phone home.
{11363}{11467}Look at Officer Ross riding|back here with the visitors.
{11473}{11568}What's up with that, Serpico?
{11613}{11692}{y:i}Are you thinking about me?|{y:i}No, of course you're not.
{11698}{11745}{y:i}But if you are, call me tonight.
{11751}{11828}{y:i}Okay, bye.
{11831}{11903}No.
{11908}{11970}I know!
{11976}{12052}Thank God, you were here.|We have to erase that.
{12058}{12100}What? We can't do that.
{12106}{12155}We have to.|What if Ross hears that...
{12161}{12212}...and calls her and|they get back together?
{12218}{12290}Is that what you want?|Ross back with that controlling...
{12296}{12382}...neurotic, crazy Emily|who wouldn't let him see you?
{12388}{12432}No! Oh, no, no.
{12438}{12501}God, no! He should not|get back with her.
{12507}{12590}I know that, you know that.|Even Ross knows that.
{12596}{12651}But we have no right|to erase his message.
{12657}{12767}Look, I'm his sister and I love him.|I don't want to see him get hurt.
{12773}{12861}Doesn't that give me|the right to control...
{12873}{12925}Help him?
{12931}{13024}He's not the one who needs help.
{13037}{13079}She's obviously unstable.
{13085}{13203}She's thinking about running|out on her wedding day.
{13256}{13352}Okay, fine. But look at the|position she's putting him in.
{13358}{13397}And what's he gonna do?
{13403}{13477}Break up their marriage|on their wedding day?
{13483}{13564}Who would do that?
{13615}{13716}Okay, fine. All right.|But that was different.
{13722}{13799}Although it did involve|a lot of the same people.
{13805}{13875}This is some twisted joke|she's playing on him.
{13881}{13955}You are crazy.|She sounded genuinely upset.
{13961}{13992}I mean, listen.
{13998}{14052}{y:i}Your messages have been erased.
{14058}{14135}No!
{14185}{14275}Okay, but we're safe, right?|Nothing bad's gonna go down.
{14281}{14337}No. But that reminds me.|Sign this.
{14343}{14369}What is it?
{14375}{14439}It says you can't sue|if you scrape your knee...
{14445}{14520}...or get your head blown off.
{14531}{14611}Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
{14617}{14678}Here he comes.
{14678}{14733}What is he doing?|What the hell is he doing?
{14739}{14759}What is it?
{14765}{14801}- Is everything okay?|- What?
{14807}{14924}He sees us. Don't move.|And don't look at him!
{15253}{15346}Hey, it's okay.|It was just a car backfire.
{15352}{15441}Hey, look at that.|You tried to save your buddy.
{15447}{15475}You see that?
{15481}{15531}You see what he did?
{15537}{15608}You okay, man?
{15663}{15726}Thanks, Joey.
{15750}{15817}Hello?
{16031}{16056}We should go.
{16062}{16084}No, wait.
{16090}{16119}Oh, yeah. Right.
{16125}{16180}No. Monica.
{16186}{16230}Monica, we have to fix this.
{16236}{16287}What can we do?|You erased the message.
{16293}{16329}Unless we tell him.
{16335}{16416}If you want to be rational,|I can't argue with you.
{16422}{16457}All right?
{16463}{16581}Fine, tell him. I just don't|want to be a part of it.
{16585}{16692}Maybe that's Emily leaving|the exact same message.
{16698}{16812}{y:i}Hey, Ross, it's you. I just|{y:i}want you to remember this feeling.
{16818}{16880}{y:i}You are lucky to be alive.
{16886}{16964}{y:i}So live every day to the fullest.
{16970}{17047}{y:i}Love yourself, okay?
{17053}{17138}{y:i}And also get stamps. Bye.
{17142}{17226}Play that message for Emily,|and this problem goes away.
{17232}{17294}Right?
{17296}{17339}Anybody want to meet a hero?
{17345}{17406}John Glenn is here?
{17412}{17437}No. Joey.
{17443}{17496}We had the most incredible night.
{17502}{17593}- We're in the car...|- Wait. Hold on.
{17625}{17647}Hi.
{17653}{17710}Okay, go ahead.
{17716}{17811}So we're in the car, and bang!|A shot was fired.
{17817}{17896}And Joey, with no regard|for his own safety...
{17902}{17950}...throws himself on me.
{17956}{17982}My God!
{17988}{18047}It was a car backfire.
{18053}{18089}But he didn't know that.
{18095}{18171}Yeah, I didn't know that.
{18182}{18252}It could just as easily|have been a bullet.
{18258}{18331}Ever think about joining the force?|We could use a guy like you.
{18337}{18423}Who jumps at loud noises.
{18433}{18506}Wow. I could have died tonight.
{18512}{18604}If the car that backfired|had run over you!
{18610}{18712}I'm going before he starts rambling|about his newfound respect for life.
{18718}{18829}I do have a newfound respect for life.
{18835}{18908}Oh, my God!
{18940}{19014}- You want to get some dinner?|- Yeah, sure.
{19020}{19136}You know what? If I heard a shot|right now, I'd throw my body on you.
{19142}{19204}Maybe we should walk|in a bad neighborhood.
{19210}{19271}Okay.
{19277}{19335}Bye.
{19431}{19470}Cut it out.
{19476}{19603}I'd hate to save your life|and kick your ass on the same day.
{19823}{19850}Why'd you take off?
{19856}{19917}Just going for a walk.
{19923}{19992}Around the living room, whatever.
{19998}{20080}- Is something wrong?|- No. No, I'm just tired.
{20086}{20178}You know, from the walk.
{20201}{20264}You dove in front of Ross!
{20270}{20317}Ross!
{20323}{20407}That's what this is about.
{20420}{20510}Oh, my God. You hate Ross!
{20516}{20542}I don't hate Ross.
{20548}{20639}Of course, you do. I saved him.|You're mad at me. It adds up.
{20645}{20720}You want Ross out of the picture.
{20726}{20746}What picture?
{20752}{20820}I don't know.|But I don't like what I'm hearing.
{20826}{20916}I'm glad you saved Ross.|But it could've been a bullet.
{20922}{21012}And you didn't try to save me.
{21023}{21100}You're upset because you think|I chose Ross over you.
{21106}{21212}No, I knew you could|take care of yourself.
{21218}{21317}You know? I mean, Ross needs help.|He's not "street" like us.
{21323}{21404}You'd risk your life for Ross|before you would for me.
{21410}{21477}That's the bottom line.
{21483}{21529}No, not exactly.
{21535}{21579}All right, look.
{21585}{21657}I wasn't trying to save Ross.
{21663}{21712}Okay?
{21718}{21818}My sandwich was next to Ross.
{21828}{21890}All right?
{21895}{21998}I was trying to save my sandwich.
{22006}{22067}From a bullet?
{22073}{22166}- I know it doesn't make much sense.|- "Much" sense?
{22172}{22233}Look, it was instinct!|I just went for it.
{22239}{22296}You risked your life for a sandwich?
{22302}{22351}I know it sounds crazy...
{22357}{22485}...but this is the greatest|sandwich in the world!
{22515}{22581}So you didn't choose Ross before me?
{22587}{22646}No. I would never do that.
{22652}{22712}You're like my brother.
{22718}{22769}- Really?|- Yeah.
{22775}{22908}In fact, to prove how much|you mean to me...
{22996}{23036}Here.
{23042}{23144}- Thanks.|- Easy, it's not a hot dog!
{23257}{23335}How good is that?
{23365}{23394}See?
{23400}{23468}What are you doing?
{23473}{23525}You're showing me how much|I mean to you.
{23531}{23580}With a bite.
{23586}{23655}Jeez!
{24061}{24098}What are you doing here?
{24104}{24134}Hey, you know what?
{24140}{24195}You are in our apartment|all the time!
{24201}{24298}This is just a drop|in the bucket, mister!
{24306}{24406}It doesn't matter. The important|thing is that you're here.
{24412}{24520}You're my friend and you're here.
{24622}{24690}Okay, just a little scared.|What's going on?
{24696}{24755}The most amazing thing|happened tonight.
{24761}{24817}I thought my number was up.
{24823}{24892}I had an actual near-death experience.
{24898}{24927}What happened?
{24933}{25076}We were on the ride-along with Gary|and somebody took a shot at me!
{25123}{25156}Really?
{25162}{25238}No. A car backfired.
{25258}{25354}But I thought somebody was taking|a shot at me. And, Rach...
{25360}{25434}...I survived!
{25440}{25537}And I was filled with|this great respect for life.
{25543}{25597}I want to experience every moment.
{25603}{25680}I want to seize every opportunity.
{25686}{25774}I am seeing everything so clearly now.
{25780}{25842}Because a car backfired?
{25848}{25933}Okay. Why are you here?
{25937}{26037}I don't know how this fits|into your whole seizing thing...
{26043}{26107}...but Emily called you today.
{26113}{26165}- You talked to her?|- She left a message.
{26171}{26217}But it kind of got erased.
{26223}{26306}I mean, there's something|wrong with your machine.
{26312}{26356}What did she say?
{26362}{26455}Something about having second|thoughts about the wedding.
{26461}{26542}And did you guys make|a mistake breaking up?
{26548}{26614}And she wants you to call her.
{26620}{26649}Wow.
{26655}{26739}That was a good thing|that I told you, right?
{26745}{26789}Yeah. Yes. Of course.
{26795}{26867}Okay, thank you. Thank you.|Because...
{26873}{26930}I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.
{26936}{26976}Because she didn't want...
{26982}{27090}Not important. Point is,|I was right. Your decision.
{27096}{27117}Okay?
{27123}{27154}I was right.
{27160}{27202}Your decision.
{27208}{27242}Right.
{27248}{27302}I guess I should call Emily.
{27308}{27362}No, that's not the right decision.
{27368}{27404}That's not right.
{27410}{27440}Ross, come on!
{27446}{27484}I mean...
{27490}{27574}...that woman made you miserable!
{27584}{27682}Do you really want|to get back into that?
{27685}{27727}Okay, look. Yesterday...
{27733}{27807}...I wouldn't have even|considered calling her back.
{27813}{27872}But my ex-wife calls|on the same day...
{27878}{27937}...I have a near-death experience?
{27943}{27990}That's gotta mean something.
{27996}{28117}That was not a near-death experience.|That was barely an experience.
{28123}{28202}You weren't there!
{28212}{28320}Maybe this is something that|I'm supposed to seize, you know?
{28326}{28380}Okay. You know what?
{28386}{28477}Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
{28483}{28576}Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
{28582}{28617}Okay? Look at today.
{28623}{28672}I mean, you escaped...
{28678}{28737}...death.
{28753}{28831}And maybe this is a chance|for you to escape...
{28837}{28911}...getting back together with Emily.
{28917}{28991}That does make sense.
{28998}{29087}Because I do want to seize|some opportunity...
{29093}{29216}...but I really don't want|to see or talk to her.
{29222}{29294}Well, there you go!
{29300}{29356}Yeah, maybe today's just...
{29362}{29451}...close-call day.
{29471}{29514}Hey, thanks, Rach.
{29520}{29580}Oh, honey. No problem.
{29586}{29651}Wait, wait.|The message is blinking.
{29657}{29701}Maybe you didn't erase it.
{29707}{29774}{y:i}Hey, Ross, it's you...
{29780}{29913}That's an old message.|Nobody needs to hear that.
{29931}{30000}Hey, was Monica here?
{30000}{30066}I want my money back.
{30072}{30167}You probably need that|for stamps, right?
{30344}{30385}Has Gary ever been shot at for real?
{30391}{30441}Yes, once.
{30447}{30471}A little.
{30477}{30541}He kind of did it to himself.
{30547}{30610}It's not really a good story.
{30616}{30699}I wonder how I'd react under fire.|And not backfire...
{30705}{30742}...but heavy fire.
{30748}{30795}Like, if I was in a war.
{30801}{30847}Man, I would be great in a war!
{30853}{30924}I think I'd make|a fantastic military leader.
{30930}{31022}I mean, I know I'd make general|before any of you guys.
{31028}{31113}Before or after you were shot|by your own troops?
{31119}{31209}I know Joey would be in the foxhole|protecting all of us.
{31215}{31306}If the foxhole was|lined with sandwiches.
{31312}{31402}Yeah, hero sandwiches.
{31424}{31532}You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm|not interested in war in any way.
{31538}{31640}But when the revolution comes,|I'll have to destroy you all.
{31646}{31714}Not you, Joey.
{72}{124}I'll get coffee.|Want anything, baby doll?
{130}{172}I'm fine. Thanks.
{178}{221}I can't pull off "baby doll", can I?
{227}{322}No, I think we learned that|from the "sugar lips" incident.
{328}{372}I'll make some tea.
{378}{453}How you doing, pumpkin?
{480}{560}- So it's going well for you two?|- I know. Really well.
{566}{630}I'm gonna ask Phoebe|to move in with me.
{636}{666}What do you think?
{672}{719}It's great!|When will you ask her?
{725}{767}Tonight. But don't say anything.
{773}{809}I swear. I promise.
{815}{845}I'm so excited!
{851}{906}But listen, do not|get her flowers, okay?
{912}{1034}Because she cries when they die.|Then there's the whole funeral.
{1051}{1161}- I'll see you after work, sweetie.|- Okay. Bye.
{1167}{1222}So what movie should we see?
{1228}{1323}Gary's gonna ask you|to move in with him!
{1326}{1345}What? Really?
{1351}{1462}He made me promise not to tell,|but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
{1468}{1494}I can't believe this.
{1500}{1602}Right? Because it's fast.|Because it's so fast. It's fast.
{1608}{1674}Relax. It's Phoebe, not you.
{1680}{1727}Good for you, Pheebs.|Way to go.
{1733}{1795}No, but it is fast, isn't it?
{1801}{1883}- I like him but I'm not ready.|- So what are you gonna do?
{1889}{1992}I don't know. I'll just handle it.|I'll ask you to talk to him!
{1998}{2022}Me? Why me?
{2028}{2076}Because you are|so afraid of commitment.
{2082}{2189}You talk to him. Make him scared|like you, make him a man.
{2195}{2254}I'll try, but I'm not sure|what good it'd do.
{2260}{2319}I'm less afraid of commitment|than I used to be.
{2325}{2385}That is so sweet.
{2391}{2493}Still terrified.|I'll take care of it.
{2566}{2651}The One with the Ball
{3783}{3879}Hey, Ross, is Staten Island|really an island?
{3885}{3955}That's why they call it|Staten "Island".
{3961}{4066}Oh, I thought it was|like Long Island.
{4161}{4232}Also an island.
{4239}{4261}What time is it?
{4267}{4306}2: 17.
{4312}{4413}We haven't dropped|this ball for an hour.
{4418}{4440}Are you serious?
{4446}{4514}I realized it a half-hour ago,|but I didn't say anything.
{4520}{4569}I didn't wanna jinx it.
{4575}{4659}We are pretty good at this.
{4666}{4746}We totally forgot about lunch.
{4747}{4810}That's the first time|I've ever missed a meal.
{4816}{4904}I think my pants are a little loose.
{4976}{5063}Hey, you guys. Is Monica here?
{5065}{5125}I bought something.|I'm not sure she'll like it.
{5131}{5225}It may seem crazy, but I've wanted|this since I was a little girl.
{5231}{5295}You bought Shaun Cassidy!
{5301}{5329}No. I wish!
{5335}{5405}Okay, you ready?
{5476}{5548}Check it out.
{5631}{5659}What is it?
{5665}{5737}What the hell is that?
{5743}{5771}It's a cat.
{5777}{5837}That is not a cat!
{5843}{5871}Yes, it is!
{5877}{5968}Why is it inside out?
{6027}{6056}Excuse me!
{6062}{6165}But this is a purebred,|show-quality sphinx cat.
{6171}{6229}How much did you pay for that?
{6235}{6292}It was extravagant,|but I got a good deal.
{6298}{6379}- How much?|- Thousand bucks.
{6392}{6448}On a cat?
{6454}{6523}It's not a cat!
{6533}{6577}All right. Listen, ball boys.
{6583}{6669}My grandma had one when I was little.|It was the sweetest thing.
{6675}{6749}It would sit in my lap|and just purr all day long.
{6755}{6823}I would drag a string|and it would chase it.
{6829}{6897}Free cats do that too, you know.
{6903}{6945}It's not a cat!
{6951}{7037}I'm really excited about this, okay?|I don't care what you think.
{7043}{7158}I'm gonna set up a litter box|for Mrs. Whiskerson.
{7158}{7248}What am I gonna call her?|Fluffy?
{7309}{7439}Do you wanna get something to eat|or see how long we can throw this ball?
{7445}{7523}The ball thing.
{7523}{7671}Wouldn't it be great if we could go|for two hours without dropping it?
{7677}{7744}Yeah, it would!
{7750}{7823}Let's do it.
{7916}{7949}I have to pee.
{7955}{8043}And Rachel's in the bathroom!
{8123}{8201}Man, I didn't think we'd make it.
{8203}{8234}I know.
{8240}{8326}Don't switch hands, okay?
{8485}{8588}Hey, ladies.|What are you in here for?
{8645}{8682}What are you doing here?
{8688}{8736}I am here to report a crime.
{8742}{8803}It's a crime that|we don't spend time together.
{8809}{8866}What's up?
{8871}{8969}You're thinking about moving in with|Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.
{8975}{9004}You know, man to...
{9010}{9056}...well, me.
{9062}{9109}Sure, okay.
{9115}{9172}Are you crazy?
{9178}{9197}Are you insane?
{9203}{9304}If you live with Phoebe, you two|are gonna be living together.
{9310}{9371}I considered that.|It'd make me happy.
{9377}{9396}You mean scared.
{9402}{9434}No, I mean happy.
{9440}{9497}Scared happy.
{9503}{9530}What are you doing?
{9536}{9574}I'm trying to open your eyes!
{9580}{9647}If you live with Phoebe,|she is always gonna be there.
{9653}{9724}You get home, she's there.|You go to bed, she's there.
{9730}{9804}You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.
{9810}{9864}I know. I can't wait!
{9870}{9952}Were your parents happy or something?
{9958}{10042}I was lucky enough to find|someone that I really love.
{10048}{10127}I just want to be around her|as much as I can.
{10133}{10198}When you say it,|it doesn't sound so scary.
{10204}{10235}You know what I'm saying?
{10241}{10282}Yeah, I think I do.
{10288}{10314}You know what?
{10320}{10423}Move in with her. Move in right now.|Maybe I'll move in with Monica.
{10429}{10514}No, it's too soon for you guys.
{10520}{10601}You're right about that.
{10638}{10702}When they found the remains|of the Mesozoic mastodon...
{10708}{10771}...they discovered what appeared|to be the remains...
{10777}{10880}...of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.
{10886}{10974}How did it get there?
{10986}{11073}Maybe this should be more|of a quiet game.
{11101}{11133}Hey, guys.
{11139}{11184}I left my watch here last night.
{11190}{11239}- It was here. Where is it?|- I don't know.
{11245}{11276}I'm late for work.
{11282}{11367}How do you know?|You don't have a watch.
{11378}{11468}Can you stop throwing the ball|for one minute and help me find it?
{11474}{11568}Oh, I don't know...|Yeah, can't do it.
{11663}{11716}- What?|- Do not drop that ball.
{11722}{11752}We haven't dropped it in...
{11758}{11832}Two hours, 27 minutes.
{11838}{11892}Really?
{11898}{11955}I won't make it in to work today.
{11961}{12039}I don't feel very good.
{12092}{12218}For a second, I thought I was|feeling better, but I'm not.
{12240}{12270}Hey, Rach.
{12276}{12366}Check it out. Almost three hours|without dropping it.
{12372}{12487}Congratulations.|That's quite a waste of time.
{12523}{12567}You have scratches all over you.
{12573}{12627}Well, it's my cat.
{12633}{12656}Oh, I got a cat.
{12662}{12687}I don't want a cat!
{12693}{12770}Don't worry, it's not a cat.
{12776}{12864}You guys, this cat is nothing|like my grandmother's cat.
{12870}{12916}It's not sweet.|It's not cute.
{12922}{13074}I dragged a string, and it flipped out|and scratched the hell out of me.
{13080}{13178}I know this sounds crazy,|but every time this cat hisses at me...
{13184}{13270}...I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
{13395}{13487}Doesn't sound as crazy|as paying $1000 for a cat.
{13493}{13558}You paid $1000 for a cat|when you owe me $300?
{13564}{13669}Well, I was gonna let you|play with it.
{13823}{13866}Did you talk to Gary|about moving in?
{13872}{13948}I think you should do it.
{13949}{14071}He's a great guy and he loves you|a lot. You are a very lucky lady.
{14077}{14150}You are useless!
{14153}{14223}Freaking out about commitment|is the one thing you can do...
{14229}{14276}...and you can't even do that right!
{14282}{14384}Sorry. If he asked me,|I'd move in with him.
{14435}{14517}Get out of here, good-for-nothing.
{14545}{14579}Hey, Chandler.
{14585}{14654}Hey, Gar.
{14656}{14690}Hey, sweetie.
{14696}{14783}Can I talk to you for a second?
{14820}{14846}You look pretty today.
{14852}{14928}Thanks. Okay.
{14930}{14952}Here's the thing.
{14958}{15032}I really want this relationship|to move forward.
{15038}{15115}If you're not moving forward,|you're moving backwards.
{15121}{15192}No, if you're not moving forward,|you're staying still.
{15198}{15303}And staying still is good.|Watch this.
{15373}{15422}I want you to move in with me.
{15428}{15477}That is so sweet.
{15483}{15537}But don't you think|it's too soon?
{15543}{15634}There's so much we don't know|about each other.
{15688}{15762}Okay. I get it.
{15768}{15894}I don't want us to jump into something|that we're not ready for.
{15958}{16012}I don't want|to mess up what we have.
{16018}{16136}I'm worried it's gonna|be a big mistake.
{16177}{16282}Which is why my answer is yes!
{16288}{16322}Really?
{16328}{16412}You're so happy.
{16531}{16620}Monica, stop throwing it so hard!
{16633}{16711}We're on the same team!
{16722}{16787}You guys have been doing this|for four hours?
{16793}{16827}That's right, baby.
{16833}{16909}- All right. Let me in.|- No, no! Don't do it!
{16915}{16969}What?
{16975}{17052}He's a dropper.
{17061}{17106}Oh, yeah. That's right!
{17112}{17154}I'm not a dropper!
{17160}{17257}It's really a three-person|game, you know?
{17263}{17325}It's throwing and catching.
{17331}{17403}All right.
{17448}{17523}Oh, it's so hard.
{17671}{17766}Don't worry, guys.|It's not a cat.
{17788}{17836}Oh, good God!
{17842}{17939}I give up. I don't know what|I'm gonna do with this thing.
{17945}{18020}Baking it didn't help?
{18054}{18101}Take it back to where you got it.
{18107}{18152}I tried. They won't take her back.
{18158}{18278}Maybe that's because she's|a minion of the Antichrist.
{18316}{18336}Why won't they take it?
{18342}{18402}They said they would only|give me store credit.
{18408}{18497}What am I gonna do?|Get 1000 regular cats?
{18503}{18563}You can keep it until you|find out what to do with it.
{18569}{18626}That's not the point.|I'm out $1000...
{18632}{18666}...I'm all scratched up...
{18672}{18790}...and I'm stuck with this stupid cat|that looks like a hand!
{18863}{18885}Oh, my God!
{18891}{18956}The cat's made my eyes water.|Don't throw it to me!
{18962}{19050}My vision's been compromised!
{19056}{19122}Oh, God! Okay.
{19128}{19181}It's okay. Man, that was close.
{19187}{19288}Yeah, you almost overreacted|to something.
{19337}{19455}- We have great news.|- We're moving in together. Yea!
{19461}{19494}Congratulations.
{19500}{19535}- I'm so excited!|- So am I.
{19541}{19642}You're not more excited than I am.|No way. I'm the most excited.
{19648}{19680}See you at the station later.
{19686}{19787}I'll see you later.|Don't forget about the moving-in!
{19793}{19833}So you're moving in with him?
{19839}{19940}I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.|Maybe it'll be all right.
{19946}{19975}I do like him a lot...
{19981}{20046}...and probably do it|eventually, anyway.
{20052}{20145}Plus think of all the money|I'll save on stamps.
{20151}{20184}Do you write him a lot?
{20190}{20236}I heard when people live together...
{20242}{20338}...they split the cost|of stamps, don't they?
{20370}{20451}- Yeah, yeah.|- That's right.
{20512}{20605}Sorry, the oven mitts|really freaked me out.
{20750}{20806}Hey, honey.
{20812}{20863}Did you find any apartments|in Brooklyn Heights?
{20869}{20900}No, nothing.
{20906}{20932}- Oh, really?|- Yeah.
{20938}{20968}- Nothing at all?|- No.
{20974}{21109}If something opens up, we'll move in.|If it has a pool. I need a pool.
{21128}{21203}Can I talk to you?
{21258}{21324}Take a seat.
{21330}{21365}You okay?
{21371}{21422}You feel all right?
{21428}{21507}I feel great because|we're moving in together.
{21513}{21542}So you...
{21548}{21666}You checked the paper for listings|in Brooklyn Heights, right?
{21672}{21719}You checked the "Post"?
{21725}{21805}Yeah, there was nothing.
{21812}{21832}Can I get some water?
{21838}{21908}In a minute.
{21913}{21956}You checked today's "Post"?
{21962}{22020}Yeah, today's.
{22026}{22082}Because this is today's "Post".
{22088}{22162}And these are the listings I found.
{22168}{22241}Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.|Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.
{22247}{22331}Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights,|Brooklyn Heights!
{22337}{22460}Oh, are these for rent?|I thought people were just bragging.
{22466}{22519}Let me tell you what's going on here.
{22525}{22604}Don't look at the table.|Look at me.
{22622}{22677}Somebody asked someone|to move in with him.
{22683}{22749}Someone said yes,|but now she has doubts...
{22755}{22875}...because things are moving too fast.|Does that sound possible?
{22910}{23008}Yes, fine! I am someone!
{23013}{23072}You want me to say it?|I have doubts!
{23078}{23158}I'm sorry!
{23198}{23252}It's okay that you feel this way.
{23258}{23352}It is soon and there's things|we don't know about each other.
{23358}{23416}Everything I know about you,|I really like.
{23422}{23547}Things I don't know, I'll learn in|a place with our names on the mailbox.
{23553}{23633}That's so sweet.
{23643}{23722}But if it's too soon for you,|we don't have to do it.
{23728}{23786}I want you to be happy.
{23792}{23829}Living with you would make me happy.
{23835}{23864}You don't have to say that.
{23870}{23936}I want to live with you.|I want to move in with you.
{23942}{23992}Are you sure?
{23998}{24076}Definitely, yes! Let's live in|an apartment we both live in.
{24082}{24126}Oh, that's great.
{24132}{24161}Oh, wait, one sec.
{24167}{24277}Hey, you! Behind the glass.|Who are you looking at?
{24283}{24428}I always wanted to say that every time|I was in these rooms, which was never.
{24467}{24490}{y:i}Show cat!
{24496}{24575}Quality show cat!
{24581}{24602}Show cat!
{24608}{24630}Oh, my God!
{24636}{24697}What's wrong with your baby?
{24703}{24751}That's not a baby. That's a cat.
{24757}{24816}- It's creepy looking.|- Oh, no.
{24822}{24945}It's actually very sweet.|It's very sweet. Look.
{24978}{25035}Yeah. Do you want it?
{25041}{25073}No, I hate cats.
{25079}{25122}Then what are you doing to me?
{25128}{25238}Get out of here, all right?|Move on!
{25240}{25275}What an unusual cat.
{25281}{25352}Yes, thank you! Exactly.|You want it?
{25358}{25381}Maybe.
{25387}{25471}I was thinking about getting a cat|from the shelter, but...
{25477}{25496}Okay. Why not?
{25502}{25584}Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.
{25590}{25640}- What?|- Okay, 1000.
{25646}{25686}Didn't you want me to adopt your cat?
{25692}{25806}I do, but you'll have to look at this|as more of an investment than a cat.
{25812}{25903}Okay, yeah.|I just wanted a cat.
{25951}{26049}Obviously, you know how to haggle,|so I won't try and take you on.
{26055}{26155}So $800, and I don't call the cops|because you are robbing me blind!
{26161}{26242}Blind! Just take the cat.|Leave the money. Run away!
{26248}{26306}Run away. Damn it!
{26312}{26428}Can't you at least smile or something?
{26454}{26558}Did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
{26688}{26761}- I'm starving.|- Come on, guys. Suck it up!
{26767}{26809}We're closing in on 10 hours.
{26815}{26862}It's gut-check time!
{26868}{26972}I don't know who made you the boss.|We invented this game.
{26978}{27021}I made this game what it is!
{27027}{27108}Not fun anymore?
{27110}{27132}I'm still hungry.
{27138}{27231}There's pizza at my place. We can eat|with one hand. Are you with me?
{27237}{27307}- I am.|- All right, let's go! Come on!
{27313}{27388}Let's go, Team Monica!
{27426}{27513}We can work out the name later.
{27571}{27621}What is your cat doing in my bowl?
{27627}{27702}I'm defrosting a chicken.
{27730}{27769}I sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
{27775}{27817}Thank God!
{27823}{27844}Get your money back?
{27850}{27881}Yeah, $1500.
{27887}{27973}You made a profit?
{28015}{28100}I just came for the red velvet pillow.
{28106}{28161}- There you go.|- Thanks, Rachel.
{28167}{28237}Don't forget, you can come|visit her anytime.
{28243}{28343}Oh, good. Great.|I'll keep that in mind.
{28415}{28513}So is this some kind|of snake or something?
{28753}{28790}I like waking up with you.
{28796}{28859}I like waking up with you too.
{28865}{28932}Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.
{28938}{28974}I could stay here all day.
{28980}{29022}That would be great.
{29028}{29153}- We could have breakfast in bed.|- Wait, just a second.
{29190}{29263}Oh, no.
{29301}{29423}All right. Come on, Monica!|Look alive. Come on!
{29502}{29542}Oh, good. You're all up.
{29548}{29625}It's six o'clock in the morning.|Why aren't you at Gary's?
{29631}{29672}Oh, yeah. That's over.
{29678}{29748}Gary's such a great guy.|You can work it out.
{29754}{29837}- He shot a bird.|- That is over.
{29837}{29882}- I'm sorry.|- That's terrible.
{29888}{29920}Are you okay?
{29926}{29975}I'll be all right.
{29981}{30027}Here, Pheebs.
{30033}{30094}I don't feel like playing.
{30185}{30209}It's okay.
{30215}{30267}It's okay.
{30273}{30345}It didn't happen.|No one needs to know.
{30351}{30402}She's not an official ball player.
{30408}{30502}Only official ball players|can drop the ball.
{30508}{30570}- Come on.|- Let's go.
{30571}{30610}You wanna get breakfast?
{30616}{30657}Okay, let's race!
{30663}{30748}First one there wins.
{30781}{30852}You guys wanna eat here?
{30971}{31002}That was great, huh?
{31008}{31059}Can you believe how long we did it?
{31065}{31115}It is amazing it lasted that long.
{31121}{31162}My arm is killing me.
{31168}{31230}No, I meant with|the dropper over here.
{31236}{31291}How did I get this|reputation as a dropper?
{31297}{31349}I am anything but a dropper.
{31355}{31428}Ross!
{360}{390}What's going on?
{396}{483}My eye is a little itchy.
{487}{554}Mine too. Yeah.
{560}{635}It's really red.|You should go see my eye doctor.
{641}{695}I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.
{701}{791}That's all I hear.|Richard, Richard, Richard.
{797}{860}Since we've dated,|I've said his name twice.
{866}{941}Okay. So Richard, Richard.
{947}{1016}It's not Richard.|It's this new guy. He's good.
{1022}{1084}I'm sorry. I'm not going|to an eye doctor.
{1090}{1161}Oh, God. Here we go.
{1167}{1254}Anytime anything comes close|to touching her eye or anyone else's...
{1260}{1316}...she, like, freaks out. Watch.
{1322}{1355}Ross, come on!
{1361}{1483}I have a weird thing with my eye.|Can we not talk about it?
{1514}{1601}Hey, Rach. You know that great song?|"Me, myself and eye".
{1607}{1642}Monica! Come on!
{1648}{1716}All those in favor|of getting lunch, say "eye".
{1722}{1756}Ross! Stop it!
{1762}{1831}How much did I love|{y:i}The King and "Eye"!
{1837}{1858}Chandler!
{1864}{1887}Me too, me too!
{1893}{1983}Just stop it! That's enough!
{1984}{2092}- You okay there, man?|- Yeah. I got too excited.
{2105}{2193}The One with Joey's Big Break
{3299}{3351}I gotta go.|I'm taking Ben to the park.
{3357}{3436}- Give him a kiss for me.|- All right. Bye.
{3442}{3482}Later.
{3488}{3555}I'm so sorry you got caught|in the middle of that.
{3561}{3688}I didn't mean to be so out there,|but I am furious with him.
{3745}{3813}Calm down?
{3815}{3919}I'm trying.|Man, that guy can push my buttons!
{3919}{3956}Why are you so mad?
{3962}{4025}- I don't wanna talk about it.|- It seems like...
{4031}{4127}You wanna be on my list too?|Keep talking.
{4130}{4208}Has anyone seen my list by the way?
{4214}{4250}No. What's it look like?
{4256}{4364}- A piece of paper and it says "Ross".|- I see.
{4417}{4489}I just got off the phone with Estelle.|Guess what?
{4495}{4536}I got the lead!
{4542}{4605}You got the lead in a movie?|What's it about?
{4611}{4689}It's called "Shutterspeed".|It's really cool.
{4695}{4792}I meet this girl in the subway|and we fall in love in, like, a day.
{4798}{4891}And then she disappears.|But I find out where she lives.
{4897}{4975}This old lady answers the door.|I say, "Where's Betsy?"
{4981}{5137}And she says, "Betsy's been dead|for ten years."
{5164}{5187}Chilling!
{5193}{5280}The best part is we're filming|in the desert outside of Vegas.
{5286}{5335}- You know what that means.|- I know.
{5341}{5439}Road trip! We can rent a car.|I have to be there by Tuesday.
{5445}{5542}Wait! My grandmother's dead.
{5634}{5694}We can talk about that too, Pheebs.
{5700}{5723}No, her cab.
{5729}{5803}She probably won't be using it.|Drive it to Las Vegas.
{5809}{5845}All right! Thanks!
{5851}{5921}What are we gonna do about my job?
{5927}{5952}Not go.
{5958}{6033}Great! Road trip, baby!
{6035}{6055}Is this okay?
{6061}{6144}Chandler, you don't have to ask|for my permission.
{6150}{6200}You can go.
{6206}{6265}Rach, we'll be late|for the eye doctor.
{6271}{6372}All right. Let's get this over with.
{6446}{6557}Look what I did.
{6579}{6633}I mean, look at this mess.
{6639}{6698}We're gonna probably have to|clean this up.
{6704}{6786}I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!
{6792}{6891}If you thought that this mess|was gonna bother me, you are wrong!
{6897}{6978}All right, let's go, Blinky.
{7222}{7280}Hey, Joey. What's up?
{7286}{7355}I can't decide which route|to take to Vegas.
{7361}{7405}You've traveled a lot, right?
{7411}{7450}Yeah, I've been around.
{7456}{7535}Which route should I take?|The north or the south route?
{7541}{7664}If you take the north route,|there's a man with a beard of bees.
{7671}{7744}Great! Problem solved!
{7750}{7868}On the south route, there's a chicken|that plays tic-tac-toe.
{7874}{7939}Well, back to square one.
{7945}{7991}I know a way that you can decide.
{7997}{8097}I'll ask you a series of questions|and you answer as quickly as you can.
{8103}{8129}Yes!
{8135}{8199}Good. But wait.
{8215}{8271}Here we go. I want you to relax.
{8277}{8316}Take a deep breath.
{8322}{8372}Clear your mind.
{8378}{8432}- Peanut butter or egg whites?|- Peanut butter.
{8438}{8490}- Be a fireman or a swimmer?|- Swimmer.
{8496}{8598}- You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel?|- Monica.
{8604}{8659}I always thought it'd be Rachel.
{8665}{8727}- No thinking. Tie or ascot?|- Ascot.
{8733}{8767}- North or south route?|- North.
{8773}{8839}Bam! There you go! Huh?
{8845}{8977}That was incredible!|Beard of bees here I come!
{9007}{9092}This guy again.
{9121}{9150}Hey, what's up?
{9156}{9211}Not much. Wanna see a movie tonight?
{9217}{9250}What do you wanna see?
{9256}{9281}I don't know.
{9287}{9348}I know how to decide.|Show him your game.
{9354}{9427}No, thank you.
{9438}{9463}What's with her?
{9469}{9519}I don't know.|I know how we can decide.
{9525}{9600}I'm gonna ask you questions|and you answer real quick.
{9606}{9643}- Action or comedy?|- Action.
{9649}{9753}Who would you rather sleep with,|Monica or Rachel?
{9822}{9907}Dude, you are sick.
{9945}{10061}I'm sorry. I forgot you had|that whole Rachel thing.
{10166}{10266}Oh, my God. What does that thing do?
{10277}{10335}- An eye removal machine.|- I'm out of here.
{10341}{10379}I'm kidding.
{10385}{10425}Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.
{10431}{10508}Monica said you were nervous.|Everything will be fine.
{10514}{10591}- So we're done.|- Almost, but first we gotta start.
{10597}{10700}This is a glaucoma test. Sit down.
{10706}{10763}Put your chin here.
{10769}{10845}Now, you'll feel a small puff of air|in each eye.
{10851}{10889}What?
{10895}{11007}A small puff of air.|Now, come on!
{11012}{11050}Here we go.
{11056}{11177}One, two, three.
{11177}{11211}I'm sorry. All right.
{11217}{11280}I'm gonna stay in here this time.
{11286}{11310}Ready?
{11316}{11386}- One, two...|- I'm sorry.
{11392}{11453}You know what?|I'm gonna hold her head.
{11459}{11532}That's okay.
{11601}{11639}I'm sorry.
{11645}{11737}You're young.|You don't have glaucoma.
{11802}{11875}So it was very, very nice|to meet you, sir.
{11881}{11936}What are you...|Are you crazy?
{11942}{12027}You got a small, minor infection|in that left eye.
{12033}{12120}Take these drops for a week|and you'll be as good as new.
{12126}{12189}No, I don't put things in my eye.
{12195}{12297}We'll see you here in three months.|And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
{12303}{12379}Give me the damn drops!
{12389}{12449}Dr. Miller?
{12455}{12527}P-E-C-F-D.
{12528}{12622}Very good, Monica!
{12627}{12727}- You know where they are.|- I sure do.
{12780}{12862}And you don't get one.
{12936}{12995}You know, those eye drops|are a miracle.
{13001}{13045}My eye is 100% better.
{13051}{13142}- They're still in my coat.|- Damn!
{13149}{13173}You ready to go?
{13179}{13311}How cold will it be there?|Will all these sweater vests be enough?
{13317}{13393}- What?|- I love you.
{13415}{13482}I wish Ross was coming with us.|I'll miss him.
{13488}{13585}Thanks. I just got|that jerk out of my mind.
{13591}{13663}Is the movie putting us up|in a big hotel suite?
{13669}{13719}Not really.|It's an independent film.
{13725}{13836}We don't have a big budget.|I'll stay in your room.
{13841}{13916}Once you get paid,|you'll be springing for a suite.
{13922}{13970}They must be paying you a lot.
{13976}{14048}For every dollar "Shutterspeed" makes...
{14054}{14144}...one penny of it goes|right in Joey's pocket.
{14150}{14216}You don't get paid unless|it makes money?
{14222}{14304}Did you not hear the plot|of the movie?
{14310}{14389}"She's been dead for ten years."
{14395}{14482}I'm gonna be a millionaire!
{14502}{14541}I wanted to say goodbye.
{14547}{14626}And to see if you guys would|place a little bet for me.
{14632}{14687}Twenty bucks on black 15.
{14693}{14745}- You got it!|- All right.
{14751}{14820}- All right. Bye-bye, now.|- Bye, you guys.
{14826}{14890}I'll say bye at the car.
{14896}{14947}Anyone wanna say bye to me|at the car?
{14953}{15089}I'll say goodbye to you at the car|if you don't mind the pus.
{15115}{15150}See you!
{15156}{15287}But wait a minute. The pus is good.|It means it's healing.
{15350}{15437}Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?
{15541}{15607}Hello?
{15750}{15777}Come on!
{15783}{15863}Sorry, I didn't see you there.
{15885}{15953}Pheebs, are you mad at me|or something?
{15959}{16020}If you are, please tell me|what it is I did.
{16026}{16090}- If you don't know, I can't help you.|- I don't know.
{16096}{16163}Well, I can't help you.
{16169}{16301}Well, whatever it is,|I am very, very sorry. Okay?
{16307}{16373}Apology accepted.
{16392}{16457}So we're good?
{16552}{16590}I'll see you later, okay?
{16596}{16620}Bye, fat ass.
{16626}{16697}All right!
{16697}{16785}Will you please tell me what it is|that made you so mad at me?
{16791}{16881}I don't know! I don't remember!
{16887}{16967}If you can't remember,|can't we just forget about this?
{16973}{17051}Oh, no. I am mad at you.|I know that much.
{17057}{17211}But I'm sorry about the "fat ass" thing|because you have a sweet, little heinie.
{17384}{17479}I'm getting pretty tired.|You'll have to take over soon.
{17485}{17585}We've been driving for a half-hour.|You haven't looked at the road once.
{17591}{17687}Don't worry. It's out there.
{17699}{17765}Maybe I just need lunch.|You wanna eat?
{17771}{17828}My treat.
{17834}{17917}Isn't that Ross' money?
{17939}{17996}Ross' treat.|Where do you wanna eat?
{18002}{18028}I don't know.
{18034}{18074}I know how we can decide.
{18080}{18126}I'll ask you questions.
{18132}{18190}And then you have to answer real fast.
{18196}{18277}So clear your mind.|Clear it right out. Clear it out.
{18283}{18366}- Would you rather be too wet or too dry?|- Too dry.
{18372}{18406}- Do you believe in ghosts?|- No.
{18412}{18502}- Will this movie be my big break?|- No.
{18502}{18570}- What?|- Yes.
{18576}{18654}- Dude, you said, "No."|- I also said, "Yes."
{18660}{18762}- This won't be my big break?|- No.
{18796}{18831}I don't believe this.
{18837}{18921}Look, I just don't want you to get|your hopes up too high.
{18927}{18998}What are you talking about?|I'm the lead in a movie!
{19004}{19103}They're not even paying you!|This doesn't sound like a real movie!
{19109}{19181}I don't know why you're dumping|all over my big break.
{19187}{19252}I don't think this is gonna be|your big break.
{19258}{19326}Are you on this trip|to make me feel like a loser?
{19332}{19398}- I'd rather be alone.|- You don't want me here?
{19404}{19436}Not if you're like this.
{19442}{19516}The next time you ask me|a question like that, I'll lie.
{19522}{19561}I don't want you on the trip.
{19567}{19628}Why don't you pull over?|I'll get out now.
{19634}{19707}Fine.
{19733}{19752}Get out.
{19758}{19800}You can't stop on a bridge.
{19806}{19887}- Get out!|- Fine!
{19924}{19980}{y:i}Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk!
{19986}{20082}{y:i}Yeah. I'm gonna die here.
{20119}{20234}Are you mad at me|because my hair gel smells?
{20241}{20321}Because I said your handwriting|is childlike?
{20327}{20398}No. That made me feel precious.
{20404}{20475}Because he's always|correcting people's grammar?
{20481}{20594}"Whom, whom." Sometimes it's "who"!
{20594}{20676}Yeah? Sometimes it's...
{20711}{20808}Did you beat him at a board game?|He's such a baby when he loses.
{20814}{20845}Okay, I'm the baby.
{20851}{20927}Hey! Stop it!
{20941}{20980}What are you doing here?
{20986}{21043}Joey kicked me out of the car|on the bridge.
{21049}{21098}- Why?|- I don't know. He went crazy.
{21104}{21188}We played that game where you|ask questions and answer fast.
{21194}{21303}That game should not be played|without my supervision.
{21309}{21345}I don't know what made him mad.
{21351}{21420}All I said was that|this wouldn't be his big break...
{21426}{21477}...that it wouldn't do|anything for him...
{21483}{21524}...and that it didn't sound real.
{21530}{21596}Okay, he should've|pushed me off the bridge.
{21602}{21626}What's in the bag?
{21632}{21671}I figured you'd be mad at me...
{21677}{21751}...so I got gifts that I found|on the roadside.
{21757}{21854}- Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?|- I do!
{22054}{22137}- Not even close.|- I need help! I can't do this.
{22143}{22186}Come on. Let's do it.
{22192}{22312}Sit down.|All right, put your head back.
{22315}{22417}- Now, open your eyes.|- Okay, they are.
{22425}{22482}- How many fingers am I holding up?|- Four.
{22488}{22518}I was thinking four.
{22524}{22573}- Really?|- Yes!
{22579}{22651}Why don't we start|with a practice one?
{22657}{22721}- No drops.|- Great!
{22727}{22847}On three. One, two, three.
{22853}{22885}My pillow's all wet!
{22891}{22938}Well, you said it was practice!
{22944}{22970}Why did you move?
{22976}{23045}I knew you were lying!
{23066}{23111}- Come here.|- What are you doing?
{23117}{23165}Stop it! Oh, my God!
{23171}{23216}I am going...
{23222}{23265}Turn it over!
{23271}{23346}I am going to get...
{23352}{23391}...get these drops in your eye.
{23397}{23501}Oh, my God! You really are|freakishly strong.
{23507}{23545}Stop! Stop!
{23551}{23613}Stop it!
{23619}{23666}Damn, it's empty!
{23672}{23799}If Joey and Chandler walked in now,|we could make a fortune.
{23926}{23985}That is definitely Chandler,|Joey or Ross.
{23991}{24052}Or Rachel.
{24122}{24192}It's Joey.
{24196}{24277}Chandler told me what happened.|He's really upset.
{24283}{24430}Not as upset as he'll be when he finds|out what I did with his sweater vests.
{24442}{24475}What did you do to them?
{24481}{24582}There's a well-dressed|pack of dogs in Ohio.
{24624}{24695}I gotta ask Phoebe|something about the car.
{24701}{24746}{y:i}Hold on one second.
{24752}{24800}- Hey, dude.|{y:i}- Hey, Pheebs.
{24806}{24878}This wooden box keeps sliding out.|What is it?
{24884}{24943}My grandma.
{25004}{25097}And thanks.|She's having a great time.
{25125}{25181}Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.
{25187}{25249}Chandler's here.|He was wondering if...
{25255}{25336}I guess he ran out of change.
{25342}{25435}How am I gonna apologize to him|if he won't even talk to me?
{25441}{25539}Send him something. So when he|gets there, he'll know you're sorry.
{25545}{25678}That's a good idea. I wonder where|I could get a basket of porn?
{25684}{25762}No, don't say I'm sorry with porn.
{25768}{25826}You should send him|a carton of cigarettes.
{25832}{25905}Because that way he can trade it|for protection.
{25911}{25979}No. That's prison.
{26037}{26095}I know how we're gonna|figure this out.
{26101}{26129}Clear your mind...
{26135}{26249}...and answer the first thing|that comes into your head.
{26255}{26307}- Do you like flora or fauna?|- Fauna.
{26313}{26351}- Simon or Garfunkel?|- Garfunkel.
{26357}{26456}- Why are you mad?|- You said I was boring.
{26491}{26526}When did I say that?
{26532}{26605}Oh, my God! I remember now!|We were playing chess.
{26611}{26681}Phoebe, you and I|have never played chess.
{26687}{26810}Remember that time on the frozen lake?|We were playing. You said I was boring.
{26816}{26947}Then you took off your energy mask|and you were Cameron Diaz.
{26984}{27081}There's a chance this|may have been a dream.
{27741}{27808}Stanley!
{27809}{27876}Your leading man is here.|Let's get to work.
{27882}{27916}Slight change of plans.
{27922}{27973}We've shut down.
{27979}{28008}What? Why?
{28014}{28111}It's a money thing.|We don't have any.
{28139}{28191}You're kidding, right?
{28197}{28221}What?
{28227}{28281}It's probably just temporary.
{28287}{28366}We're hoping to get some money soon.|Just hang out.
{28372}{28418}Hang out? How long?
{28424}{28511}I don't know. A week. Maybe two.|The money'll turn up.
{28517}{28616}People always wanna invest in movies.|You're not rich?
{28622}{28684}Worth a shot.
{28692}{28807}Well, Joey. Let me know|where you're staying, okay?
{28832}{28896}Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani?
{28902}{28936}These got left for you.
{28942}{29005}Thanks.
{29011}{29132}"Congratulations on your big break."
{29871}{29932}{y:i}- Monica, it's Joey.|- Hey, Joey.
{29938}{29995}You remember me|even though you're a star.
{30001}{30117}{y:i}Come on. It'll be years|{y:i}before I forget you.
{30125}{30171}What's it like on a movie set?
{30177}{30251}Do you have a dressing room|and a chair with your name?
{30257}{30319}{y:i}Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.
{30325}{30395}{y:i}Tell Chandler he couldn't|{y:i}have been more wrong.
{30401}{30519}{y:i}I gotta go, Monica. My sushi's here.
{30585}{30661}Sorry about that.|Thanks for waiting.
{30667}{30737}Everybody smile.
{30756}{30912}Thanks a lot. Enjoy your stay|at Caesar's. We hope it's toga-rific.
{30929}{31012}Kill me. Kill me now.
{31109}{31189}Rach, can you pass me the "TV Guide"?
{31195}{31225}Go!
{31231}{31315}What are you doing?|Get off! Oh, my God!
{31321}{31397}Hold it open. Okay.
{31520}{31617}We'll see you in about|three or four hours.
{133}{164}Could you get that?
{170}{274}Why? Just because you're too lazy|to get up off your tushy?
{280}{438}All the people in the entire world that|I would wanna talk to are right here.
{488}{560}Sucker!
{580}{626}- Hey, Joey!|{y:i}- Hey, Pheebs.
{632}{661}Can you do me a favor?
{667}{747}I forgot the PIN to my ATM card.|Can you get it for me?
{753}{782}{y:i}Sure. Where is it?
{788}{872}I scratched it on the ATM machine|on the corner.
{878}{926}So you're 5-6-3-9?
{932}{1009}That's it! Thanks.
{1009}{1068}- Wanna talk to Chandler?|- Let me talk to him.
{1074}{1116}{y:i}He didn't believe in my movie...
{1122}{1239}...which is a big mistake,|because it is real. Real.
{1245}{1352}Tribbiani, get back to work.|Break time's over.
{1362}{1395}Who was that?
{1401}{1515}My stunt double. He's getting|too familiar for my taste.
{1521}{1561}I've tried to apologize.
{1567}{1651}If I can't do it on the phone,|I'll go and do it in person.
{1657}{1742}I heard that. Can you put him on?
{1796}{1856}Don't come out here.
{1870}{1951}I support you 100% and I wanna prove|that to you in person.
{1957}{2034}I got that. I forgive you.|Don't come out here.
{2040}{2091}You haven't taken|my calls for a week.
{2097}{2216}I'm totally over it. Friends forever.|Don't come out here.
{2222}{2296}Would you mind doing|a picture with us?
{2302}{2321}What was that?
{2327}{2407}{y:i}Entertainment Tonight.
{2422}{2530}Good talking to you|and don't come out here.
{2574}{2657}The One in Vegas
{3789}{3885}I'm sorry I'm late.
{4045}{4102}I'm so sorry.|Have you been here long?
{4108}{4167}That's okay.
{4173}{4252}What the hell took you so long?
{4267}{4330}You can't tell Chandler.|I ran into Richard.
{4336}{4370}- Which Richard?|- The Richard.
{4376}{4453}Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!
{4459}{4561}No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.|You know, the tall guy, mustache.
{4567}{4622}Okay, that actually|makes more sense.
{4628}{4647}How was it?
{4653}{4743}It was really nice. We talked|and I had lunch with him.
{4749}{4823}That's weird. I dreamed|you had lunch with Richard.
{4829}{4892}- Really?|- Again, Richard Simmons.
{4898}{4918}Go on.
{4924}{4982}The strange part was|he was really nice...
{4988}{5057}...and he looks great,|but I didn't feel anything.
{5063}{5106}So why can't we tell Chandler?
{5112}{5221}It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our|anniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.
{5227}{5300}I can't believe you guys|have lasted a whole year!
{5306}{5398}Wow, I owe Rachel twenty bucks.
{5416}{5496}On a totally different bet.
{5557}{5615}- It's almost our anniversary!|- I know.
{5621}{5713}One year ago today, I was just|your annoying friend Chandler.
{5719}{5820}Now you're just|my annoying friend Chandler.
{5826}{5846}I got you a gift.
{5852}{5980}- It's not till tomorrow.|- I know, but you have to open it today.
{6247}{6299}Okay! There you go!
{6305}{6367}It's two tickets to Vegas!
{6373}{6443}Yeah! For this weekend!|It'll be perfect.
{6449}{6548}You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start|our celebration on the plane.
{6554}{6652}We can call it our "Plane-a-versary".
{6658}{6715}We have to?
{6729}{6807}This is great, but Joey didn't want|any of us there.
{6813}{6926}He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.|He'll be excited when we surprise him.
{6932}{7061}Plus, we get to have|our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!
{7073}{7149}"Anna-vada-versary!"
{7155}{7217}I think we should see other people.
{7223}{7256}We can go, right?
{7262}{7290}Great idea.
{7296}{7364}I'm gonna go too!
{7403}{7453}Pheebs, it's kind of|our anniversary.
{7459}{7524}You won't ditch me|like you did with London.
{7530}{7572}Ditch you?|You were pregnant...
{7578}{7653}Great story. I'm going.
{7737}{7876}Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go|to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
{7886}{7934}Including me!
{7940}{7963}Do you wanna go?
{7969}{8014}I can take a couple days off work.
{8020}{8153}Of course you can take a couple days|off, because this trip includes me!
{8159}{8236}I've got a presentation tomorrow.|I can't miss that.
{8242}{8352}I've got tickets to the Van Gogh|exhibit. I waited a year for this.
{8358}{8423}Art lover.
{8506}{8548}What?
{8554}{8609}I said, "Art lover."
{8615}{8643}Is that an insult?
{8649}{8714}I don't know. I'm very tired.
{8720}{8772}Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?
{8778}{8798}Sounds great.
{8804}{8855}I'll call the airlines.
{8861}{8941}That'll be nice to have|the apartment to myself.
{8947}{9020}To walk around naked.
{9043}{9134}No, so I can be by myself.|Have a little alone time.
{9140}{9186}Naked alone time.
{9192}{9278}Just because I'm alone doesn't mean|I wanna walk around naked.
{9284}{9340}You live alone,|you don't walk around naked.
{9346}{9453}Why does it takes me so long|to answer the door?
{9617}{9729}So far, is this trip to Las Vegas|better or worse than the trip to London?
{9735}{9810}So far, it's pretty much|the same, Pheebs.
{9816}{9919}What about after I give you|these candies?
{9925}{9994}I guess it's a little better now.
{10000}{10097}Las Vegas, 1.|London, 0.
{10103}{10160}I'll be back.
{10214}{10289}Happy Plane-a-versary.
{10292}{10329}I love you.
{10335}{10440}- Can I give you your present now?|- Okay!
{10514}{10561}Oh, don't tell me I did this.
{10567}{10659}I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!
{10665}{10762}How about "I did forget the present,|forgive me" not fake-out?
{10768}{10826}You can give it to me|when we get back.
{10832}{10888}This is the worst thing|that could happen.
{10894}{11001}You decided to tell him|about the Richard thing.
{11065}{11096}What "Richard thing"?
{11102}{11184}Oh, no.
{11190}{11214}What "Richard thing"?
{11220}{11300}Simmons. Go with Simmons.
{11435}{11481}I ran into Richard yesterday.
{11487}{11575}He asked me if I wanted to go|for a bite and I did.
{11581}{11642}I didn't tell you|because you'd get mad...
{11648}{11716}...and I didn't wanna spoil|our anniversary.
{11722}{11795}I'm not mad.
{11811}{11858}Really?
{11864}{11975}So you bumped into Richard.|You grabbed a "bite".
{12000}{12075}No big deal.
{12114}{12183}Great.
{12233}{12330}Okay, London, 1.
{13059}{13135}Oh, look what happened.
{13155}{13199}{y:i}Check me out.
{13205}{13261}{y:i}I'm in my kitchen...
{13267}{13317}{y:i}... naked.
{13323}{13391}{y:i}I'm picking up an orange.
{13397}{13457}{y:i}I'm naked.
{13487}{13547}{y:i}I'm lighting the candles.
{13553}{13657}{y:i}Naked. And carefully.
{13883}{13990}{y:i}Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!
{14005}{14067}{y:i}I can't look at that.|{y:i}I am looking at this.
{14073}{14189}{y:i}Okay, vivid colors,|{y:i}expressive brush strokes.
{14195}{14299}{y:i}Unless she wants me|{y:i}to be looking at that.
{14305}{14346}{y:i}She knows I'm home.
{14352}{14421}{y:i}She knows I can see her.
{14427}{14513}{y:i}What kind of game is she playing?
{14519}{14634}{y:i}I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
{14640}{14673}{y:i}Dr. Geller.
{14679}{14790}{y:i}Stop it. You're being silly.
{14795}{14875}{y:i}Or am I?
{14905}{14998}{y:i}Love to love you baby
{15012}{15095}{y:i}Love to love you baby
{15250}{15331}{y:i}Love to love you baby
{15337}{15405}Darn it!
{15769}{15829}May I come in?
{15835}{15882}Yeah, if you want to.
{15888}{15971}Do you want me to?
{15977}{16003}Yeah, sure?
{16009}{16090}So do I.
{16165}{16248}Okay, Rach, before anything happens...
{16254}{16318}...I wanna lay down a couple|of ground rules.
{16324}{16389}This is just about tonight.
{16395}{16531}I won't go through with this|if it'll raise the question of "us".
{16545}{16616}I just want this to be...
{16654}{16739}...about what it is.
{16804}{16831}And...
{16837}{16879}...what is that, Ross?
{16885}{16985}The physical act of love.
{16985}{17018}What, are you crazy?
{17024}{17177}So you weren't trying to entice me|just now with your nakedness?
{17210}{17306}Oh, God. You saw me?
{17358}{17488}You weren't trying to entice me|with your nakedness?
{17494}{17630}You actually thought|I wanted to have sex with you?
{17969}{18087}I'm sorry, but, Ross,|you kicked off your shoes!
{18093}{18156}Can we just forget this ever happened?
{18162}{18208}Of course, you're right.|I'm sorry.
{18214}{18252}Thank you.
{18258}{18290}I guess I'll go pack.
{18296}{18334}Wait, one more thing.
{18340}{18453}Do we still need to settle|the question of "us"?
{19006}{19041}Hey, you guys, wait!
{19047}{19069}You guys.
{19075}{19129}This place is much better than London.
{19135}{19198}A lady dressed like Cleopatra|gave me this.
{19204}{19264}Ninety-nine cent|steak and lobster dinner.
{19270}{19303}You don't eat animals.
{19309}{19392}For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.
{19398}{19449}I can totally settle down here.
{19455}{19576}It's got everything I could ever want.|Including Joey! Look!
{19582}{19614}Look! Hey!
{19620}{19683}Oh, my God.
{19828}{19893}Love your condoms, my man.
{19899}{19955}Why are you here?|I told you not to come.
{19961}{20022}Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
{20028}{20162}Because I'm shooting a scene right now.|I play a gladiator.
{20166}{20224}Hold on a second. Can we cut?
{20230}{20294}My friends are here.|I'm gonna take a break.
{20300}{20366}Who are you talking to?
{20372}{20407}The director.
{20413}{20480}Her.
{20520}{20593}All right, it's not a gladiator movie.|I work here.
{20599}{20632}Why? What happened?
{20638}{20688}The movie shut down.|Ran out of money.
{20694}{20772}I'm working here till it starts up,|if it ever does.
{20778}{20819}- I'm so sorry.|- Such a drag.
{20825}{20877}Sorry I didn't tell you.|I'm sorry.
{20883}{20958}Apparently there's|a new policy of not sharing.
{20964}{21064}- I knew you weren't okay with that.|- So you're a gladiator!
{21070}{21104}What's going on?
{21110}{21153}Monica had lunch with Richard.
{21159}{21216}Dawson?
{21242}{21306}But that would've been so cool!
{21312}{21344}Her boyfriend Richard.
{21350}{21452}It meant nothing. After all this time,|how can you not trust me?
{21458}{21578}When you go lunching with hunky men|and don't tell me!
{21593}{21671}You're right. I'm sorry.|I should've told you.
{21677}{21716}Thanks.
{21722}{21809}- There we go.|- Now I love Vegas.
{21815}{21926}I promise you next time|I absolutely will tell you.
{21976}{22001}"Next time"?
{22007}{22059}So close.
{22065}{22139}There won't be a next time.|You cannot see him again.
{22145}{22231}I cannot see him?|You can't tell me what to do.
{22237}{22304}That's funny, I think I just did.
{22310}{22374}If you act like this,|I won't be around you.
{22380}{22419}- Fine.|- Happy anniversary!
{22425}{22482}Guys, please! Come on, come on.
{22488}{22539}This is obviously|a misunderstanding.
{22545}{22569}No, it is not.
{22575}{22666}Don't look at me.|I just work here.
{22787}{22898}Okay, Ross? I'm a little warm,|so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.
{22904}{22966}Now, I'm just letting you know...
{22972}{23107}...this is not an invitation|to the physical act of love.
{23113}{23179}Yep, that's hilarious.
{23185}{23232}I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
{23238}{23312}You know, last night was|embarrassing for you too.
{23318}{23408}No, not really. You've seen me|naked hundreds of times.
{23414}{23496}But it was the first|for the rest of my building.
{23502}{23599}That's true. But you know,|I just don't embarrass that easily.
{23605}{23655}What? You totally get embarrassed.
{23661}{23770}No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just|a more secure person than you are.
{23776}{23853}- Is that so?|- Yeah.
{23860}{23888}Hey, lady!
{23894}{23951}I don't care how much|you want it, okay?
{23957}{24065}I am not gonna have sex|with you in the bathroom!
{24155}{24252}You know, in Roman times,|this was more than just a hat.
{24258}{24277}Really?
{24283}{24314}Yeah, sure, sure.
{24320}{24368}They would scrub the floors.
{24374}{24434}They'd use it to get the mud|off their shoe.
{24440}{24507}Sometimes underneath|the horse would get dirty.
{24513}{24571}So they would stick it right...
{24577}{24649}I can't believe this is how|I'm spending my anniversary.
{24655}{24765}I'll take you someplace nice.|A guy tipped me $100.
{24771}{24849}He was playing blackjack|for an hour and he won $5000.
{24855}{24894}Can you believe that?
{24900}{24952}If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.
{24958}{24992}Build up my upper body...
{24998}{25084}...and hit Richard from behind|with a stick.
{25090}{25156}Wait! Why don't I just|do what that guy did?
{25162}{25214}I'll take this $100,|turn it into $5000...
{25220}{25316}...and I'll turn that into enough|to get my movie going!
{25322}{25352}Good luck.
{25358}{25415}I don't need luck.|I've thought this through.
{25421}{25482}I see.
{25662}{25694}Thanks.
{25700}{25781}I can't believe this.|This is like the worst night ever.
{25787}{25869}You had a minor setback|in your relationship.
{25875}{25952}Big deal.|It's only Chandler.
{25960}{26061}I am so sorry.
{26069}{26144}This is crazy having|such a stupid argument.
{26150}{26190}I don't wanna see Richard.
{26196}{26243}So go fix it.
{26249}{26313}Find Chandler.|He's probably in your room.
{26319}{26371}Tell him sorry and you love him.
{26377}{26418}You're right, Phoebe.
{26424}{26483}- Thank you.|- Sure.
{26489}{26605}Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!
{26825}{26857}Anybody lose this?
{26863}{26882}Coming out.
{26888}{26936}Place your bet.
{26942}{27016}Dice her out.
{27033}{27120}Yellow 11. Pay the front line!
{27293}{27414}So I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
{27448}{27564}All right, all right.|Just keep walking, all right?
{27760}{27803}What are you...|I am sorry, sir.
{27809}{27918}I think he just really likes you.
{28018}{28140}You know that teacher who had a baby|with her student?
{28382}{28417}- Can I help you?|- Yes.
{28423}{28576}Do you have any extra pants? My friend|seems to have had a little accident.
{28675}{28759}- Can I change $100?|- Changing $100.
{28765}{28856}- Good luck, sir.|- Thanks.
{28864}{28933}That's right.
{29015}{29094}- Thirteen.|- Hit me!
{29100}{29185}Oh, man!
{29215}{29280}Wait!
{29296}{29345}You are not gonna believe this!
{29351}{29454}I have found my identical hand twin.
{29514}{29559}What?
{29565}{29639}My identical hand twin!
{29645}{29684}What's an identical hand twin?
{29690}{29724}What does it sound like?
{29730}{29809}It's a guy with my identical hands.
{29815}{29903}It was incredible. The dealer's hands|were exactly like mine.
{29909}{30004}It was like looking|at my hands in a mirror!
{30005}{30094}You sure you weren't|looking at your hands in a mirror?
{30100}{30192}Don't you see what this means?|I can forget about that stupid movie.
{30198}{30273}I'm gonna be a millionaire!
{30293}{30314}How?
{30320}{30376}I don't have it all worked out yet.
{30382}{30506}But it's gotta mean big money.|Come on, identical hands!
{30508}{30556}Again, I must go back to...
{30562}{30622}...how?
{30628}{30755}This is Vegas, man.|People will pay to see freaky stuff!
{30764}{30826}How much would you pay|to see this hand...
{30832}{30910}...twice?
{30963}{31039}I can't really put a price on that.
{31045}{31131}Are you un-supporting me again?
{31137}{31224}I support you 100%.|I just didn't get it right away.
{31230}{31264}Now I'm caught up.
{31270}{31314}Identical hand twins.
{31320}{31391}It's a million-dollar idea!
{31522}{31566}I found my identical hand twin!
{31572}{31662}Oh, you're so lucky!
{31736}{31831}So where's Monica?|Did you guys make up?
{31837}{31881}But she just came up here.
{31887}{31934}That was Joey.
{31940}{31990}I wonder where she is?|It's so weird.
{31996}{32041}She's probably talking to Richard.
{32047}{32096}Would you stop that?
{32102}{32180}You know what she said|after her lunch with Richard?
{32186}{32281}She didn't feel anything for him.|She loves you.
{32287}{32326}- Really?|- Yes.
{32332}{32474}She feels terrible. She really wants|to make up. You've gotta find her.
{32521}{32587}Good.
{32714}{32812}I should really start wearing hats.
{33881}{33951}Welcome to Las Vegas.
{33957}{34008}- Did you enjoy your flight?|- I did.
{34014}{34098}Thank you very much.|It was excellent.
{34104}{34237}- I hope you had a nice flight.|- Oh, it was the best.
{34360}{34460}I think the check-in is that way.
{34610}{34680}Kids love me.
{34686}{34748}Hi, you guys are here!
{34754}{34836}What'd you do?|Did you go to a costume party?
{34842}{34871}Let me guess.
{34877}{34937}Pancho Villa.
{34950}{35032}And you're Bob Saget.
{35051}{35114}Pancho Villa?
{35124}{35232}What are you talking about, Pheebs?|I don't...
{35271}{35334}Oh, my God! You drew on me?
{35340}{35406}Hey, you wet my pants!
{35412}{35473}What kind of party was this?
{35479}{35580}I've been walking around like this?|You have so crossed a line.
{35586}{35688}Rach, wait.|The men's room is that way.
{35809}{35911}It's the third time she's won|on a machine I was playing.
{35917}{35988}I bet she's one of those people.
{35994}{36043}Mole people?
{36049}{36096}What? No, a lurker.
{36102}{36123}What's that?
{36129}{36196}When you're playing a machine|and it hasn't paid out...
{36202}{36257}...a lurker waits for you|to give up and then...
{36263}{36325}Kills you?
{36344}{36441}They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
{36455}{36540}- How do you know about this?|- My nana used to do it.
{36546}{36625}That's how she paid for my dance...|Karate lessons.
{36631}{36663}Dance karate?
{36669}{36729}Yes, it's a deadly...
{36735}{36817}...but beautiful sport.
{36876}{36925}- It won't come off.|- What?
{36931}{36957}It won't come off.
{36963}{37015}Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?
{37021}{37116}I took it off|and then I drew it back on.
{37134}{37194}You made it!
{37230}{37301}Who's your friend?|He's hot.
{37307}{37330}Thanks, man.
{37336}{37433}Listen, I talked to Chandler.|And I'm sorry about the movie.
{37439}{37462}Don't be sorry.
{37468}{37564}I don't need it anymore.|I found my identical hand twin.
{37570}{37589}Your what?
{37595}{37678}My identical hand twin.|The person whose hands are like mine.
{37684}{37715}This is a gold mine.
{37721}{37787}What?
{37789}{37838}That won't make you any money.
{37844}{37876}Well, fine.
{37882}{38000}None of you will live with me|in my hand-shaped mansion.
{38009}{38103}Except you.|You can live in the thumb.
{38132}{38217}All right, baby, come on!
{38217}{38249}I am on fire!
{38255}{38286}See you later.
{38292}{38326}What are you doing?
{38332}{38371}What's it look like?|Going home.
{38377}{38442}Why?
{38474}{38501}Wait.
{38507}{38569}Sorry, I was just playing|for one second.
{38575}{38654}If you don't want me to see|Richard again, I won't.
{38660}{38699}He means nothing to me.
{38705}{38797}Oh, come on. I was there.
{38826}{38894}I know he's the love of your life.
{38900}{38959}Not anymore.
{38965}{39004}Really?
{39010}{39087}Really.
{39126}{39159}All right?
{39165}{39293}Let's forget about going home|and celebrate our anniversary.
{39300}{39350}Okay, this is empty.
{39356}{39471}I wanted to make a dramatic scene,|but I hate packing.
{39607}{39636}Where's the other guy?
{39642}{39672}Which guy?
{39678}{39755}Tall, dark hair, hand looks|exactly like this?
{39761}{39882}I don't know about the hands,|but he went to the restroom.
{40007}{40067}How you doing?
{40073}{40092}Very busy.
{40098}{40172}Right. Okay.
{40245}{40316}Yes, hello. I have a question.
{40322}{40436}I used your pen to draw|on my friend's face.
{40442}{40529}A beard and a mustache.
{40557}{40617}Thank you.
{40637}{40688}No, she didn't think so.
{40694}{40779}I know. It's like...|Anyway...
{40781}{40881}Makeup didn't cover it, we've tried|everything and nothing's worked.
{40887}{40968}What do we do?
{41091}{41134}Thank you.
{41140}{41201}Yeah, it's not coming off.
{41207}{41250}What? What else did he say?
{41256}{41371}He said he thought I was funny.
{41382}{41454}Okay, look.|Let's just go downstairs...
{41460}{41540}...we'll have some fun|and you will forget all about it.
{41546}{41619}There's no way I am leaving|looking like this!
{41625}{41675}Come on, Rach. It's not that bad.
{41681}{41758}Ross, I am a human doodle!
{41764}{41866}Just because some idiot drew on your|face doesn't mean you can't have fun.
{41872}{41924}Besides, no one will|even look at you.
{41930}{42052}This is Vegas. Hello?|There are tons of other freaks here.
{42058}{42180}There are tons of freaks here.|No other. No.
{42186}{42288}Come on. No one will notice. I swear.
{42423}{42525}There was some staring and pointing.
{42536}{42576}I need a drink.
{42582}{42683}They really overcharge you|for that stuff.
{42691}{42798}But who cares,|because it's all on me.
{42872}{42951}That is one big drink.
{42957}{43008}Macadamia nut?
{43014}{43111}Wow! That's some pricey nut.
{43131}{43191}Really like those macadamia nuts?
{43197}{43258}Nope.
{43562}{43615}Get out of here, you lurker!
{43621}{43689}Go on, get!
{43737}{43779}You made up.
{43785}{43834}I couldn't be mad at him|for too long.
{43840}{43923}She couldn't live|without the "Chand love".
{43987}{44038}Get a room.
{44044}{44063}We have one.
{44069}{44128}Use it.
{44254}{44328}That's right.|Take good care of those babies.

{53827}{53901}Someone has to convince|my hand twin to cooperate.
{53907}{53926}I'll do it.

{54142}{54226}Are you okay?

{56675}{56738}Take a hike, toots.
{56762}{56795}Excuse me, sir.

{56870}{56931}Is that true, miss?
{56937}{57011}Sells drugs to kids.
{57030}{57102}She sells drugs to kids.
{57108}{57154}It was my quarter.
{57160}{57201}Was it her quarter?
{57207}{57271}How about we talk|about this over dinner?
{57277}{57366}- Okay, lady, you're out of here.|- No, you can't arrest me!
{57372}{57459}I won't go back to that hellhole!
{57464}{57561}I'm just taking you outside.
{57662}{57801}I need something old, something new,|something borrowed and something blue.

{57936}{57966}- Let's go.|- No, wait!
{57972}{58007}We need something old.
{58013}{58142}I have a condom in my wallet|that I've had since I was twelve.
{58151}{58189}That'll work.
{58195}{58272}I don't think so.
{58272}{58336}Now something borrowed.
{58345}{58405}Here, just take this.
{58411}{58438}That's stealing.
{58444}{58534}We'll bring it back.|Put it under your dress.

{60414}{60516}I've never seen that|in the business world.
{60519}{60576}Stop it.
{60582}{60697}Miss Falangie, may I ask you a question|as an impartial person at this table?
{60703}{60777}Please stop it.
{60784}{60856}Wouldn't you pay good money|to see identical hands...
{60862}{60966}...showcased in some type|of an entertainment venue?
{60972}{61102}If you leave now, I will chop off|my hand and give it to you!

Hey, don't you give me
any of your-- Hey!

Why are you here?

12
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:50,089
Ross and Rachel left a message.
They're getting married.

13
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:54,450
-Isn't that why you guys are here?
-Yes. Why else would we be here?

What happened?
Did we miss it?

00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:00,606
We missed it.

00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,849
Maybe you wouldn't have
if you could run in the chapel!

17
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:06,041
This is insane.

18
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:09,130
What's the big deal?
It's not like it's a real marriage.

19
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:11,045
What?

20
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:14,885
If you marry in Vegas,
you're only married in Vegas.

If you marry here,
you're married everywhere.

Why are we in bed together?

29
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,040
I don't know.

30
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,089
Do you have any clothes on?

31
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:50,081
Yes.

32
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,281
-Really?
-No.

33
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:56,445
But we didn't have. . .

34
00:02:58,332 --> 00:03:00,482
. . .sex, did we?

35
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,721
I don't remember much
about last night.

36
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:08,129
It was such a blur.

37
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:12,490
I remember laughing.
I laughed a lot.

38
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,045
Then we didn't have sex.

39
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,042
Oh, I mean,
we were really drunk.

40
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:23,924
I'm glad we didn't
do anything stupid.

41
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:25,645
Tell me about it.

42
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,245
Morning, Pheebs.

43
00:03:33,052 --> 00:03:36,169
Well, my movie has been
officially canceled.

44
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:38,849
Joey, I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,246
You want my breakfast?

46
00:03:41,132 --> 00:03:42,850
Too depressed to eat.

47
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:45,327
I'll probably eat in, like,
five minutes.

48
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:49,090
I'll fly home with you.
What time is your flight?

49
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,760
-What about my cab?
-I don't need that anymore.

50
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,406
You borrowed my cab.
You have to drive it back.

51
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,570
I don't wanna drive back
by myself. I get lonely.

52
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:01,167
How about if you come with me?

53
00:04:01,372 --> 00:04:03,647
-It's a long trip.
-That would be great.

54
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,082
We could talk and play games.

55
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:10,041
This could be our chance
to, like, renew our friendship.

56
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,446
Are you asking me
to have a "frienaissance"?

57
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:16,487
Sure?

58
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:21,449
All right, although I don't think we
need one. I never stopped loving you.

59
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,249
So has anybody talked
to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?

60
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,727
They left me a message.
They'll be here.

61
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:33,446
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.

62
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:37,450
It's a buffet, man.

63
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,007
Here's where I win
all my money back!

64
00:04:43,532 --> 00:04:44,726
I gotta talk to you.

65
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:45,921
Sure.

66
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,247
What's up?

67
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,568
Monica and I almost got married.

68
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:59,126
My God!

69
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,243
That's huge!

70
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:05,321
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?

71
00:05:06,252 --> 00:05:10,325
And who was gonna be your best man?
Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.

72
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,686
I just don't think that Monica and I
are ready yet. I love her. . .

00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:18,242
. . .but seeing Ross and Rachel
come out of that chapel. . .

74
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:23,242
. . .was like a wake-up call that Monica
and I are moving so fast, you know.

75
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,048
How do I tell her
without crushing her?

76
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:30,847
Tell her she's not marriage material.

77
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:34,041
What?

78
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,528
Girls say it to me all the time.

79
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:43,241
And if she's anything like me,
she's just gonna be relieved.

80
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,248
How do I tell him that it's too soon?

81
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,761
He's gonna think
I don't love him anymore.

82
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:52,167
-Well, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

83
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,203
Good. I was just testing you.

84
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:57,450
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

85
00:05:57,652 --> 00:05:59,688
We were just talking about bacon.

86
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:02,048
No, we were talking about tennis.

87
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:04,402
Tennis is more believable.

88
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:11,050
Thank you.

89
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:14,050
Coffee.

90
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:22,688
What?

91
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:25,884
Are we gonna talk about
what you guys did last night?

92
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:31,242
What do you mean "Iast night"?
Nothing happened last night.

93
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,446
Ross invited us all to watch.

94
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,652
We weren't gonna miss
our friends marrying.

95
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:41,649
Who got married?

96
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:45,085
You did.

97
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:47,325
What?

98
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:51,641
-Hello. We didn't get married.
-No, we didn't. That's ridi--

99
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:59,050
Wait, wait, wait.
I remember being in a chapel.

100
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,562
They would not let us get married
when we were that drunk.

101
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,728
They let you get married.

102
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:07,048
Most people who marry
in Vegas are drunk.

103
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:10,243
Now, I'm drunk right now.

104
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,641
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
I'm on vacation.

105
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,400
What are you gonna do?

106
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:19,921
Well, I guess we find
a divorce lawyer.

107
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:23,124
Well, I think, I think
Ross already has one.

108
00:07:25,772 --> 00:07:29,651
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two.

109
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:32,442
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. . .

110
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,041
. . .because we don't need
to get divorced.

111
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:37,971
-We're just gonna get an annulment.
-An annulment?

112
00:07:38,172 --> 00:07:41,244
Ross, I don't think surgery
is the answer here.

113
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:45,443
Oh, that's your thing!

114
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:47,447
What?

115
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:51,404
Your thing, that you're the guy
who gets divorced.

116
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:55,567
No, no, that's not "my thing. "

117
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,208
I do not love getting divorced.

118
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:01,644
Yes, you do. This is
your third divorce.

119
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:05,322
You love divorce so much,
you're probably gonna marry it. . .

120
00:08:07,332 --> 00:08:10,847
. . .and then it won't work out,
so you're gonna have to divorce it.

121
00:08:12,532 --> 00:08:13,806
I'm so drunk.

122
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:23,481
-So what should we do?
-I don't know.

123
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,284
I know I love you.

124
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,050
I know I love you.

125
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:34,167
Where are we on the whole
"going back. . .

126
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:37,250
. . .to where they have the marriages"
thing? I love you.

127
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,644
That's a good question.

128
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,488
Last night we let the dice decide.

129
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:45,604
We should leave it
up to fate again. I love you!

130
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:48,282
We don't get married
unless there's a sign.

131
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:50,050
So say. . . .

132
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,686
You roll another eight,
then there's a sign. . .

133
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,086
. . .that we should marry.

134
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,805
Eight we get married. . .

135
00:08:56,012 --> 00:09:00,164
. . .but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1 0,
1 1 , 1 2, we don't get married.

136
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:01,441
Sounds great.

137
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,450
Hey, we got a shooter.

138
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:04,761
Money, please.

139
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,081
-Ready?
-Ready.

140
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:08,044
Come on, eight.

141
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,930
Yes, yes, eight.

142
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:16,650
Eight, easy eight.

143
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:23,042
-I can't believe I rolled an eight.
-That was so unlikely.

144
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:25,687
Let's get married.

145
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,445
I guess.

146
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,607
Last night I rolled a hard eight.

147
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:33,565
It was the wrong kind of eight.
No wedding! Damn it!

148
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,286
I wanted it so bad!

149
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:40,641
Wanna go pack?

150
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:45,171
We're doing the right thing.

151
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:46,851
Of course we are.

152
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,804
We left it up to fate.

153
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:52,448
If we were supposed to get married,
there would be a sign.

154
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:03,850
Okay, you have 1 9 questions left.
Use them wisely.

155
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:11,650
Come on, Joey. You can't win
if you don't ask any questions!

156
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,208
What?

157
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:16,130
You promised me a fun road trip.

158
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,927
We've been on the road for 6 hours,
and you've been asleep for 5 1 /2.

159
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:23,249
We are switching, and
you are going to drive back.

160
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:27,127
That will be your punishment,
you greedy sleeper!

161
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,087
All right.

162
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:32,045
And until then, you are going
to sing to me.

163
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:36,450
Because the radio's broken, and you are
selfish, but you have a nice voice.

164
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:38,527
-Really?
-Sing!

165
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:43,647
I wanna rock 'n ' roll all night

166
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:53,048
Man, this is a long drive.

167
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:56,051
Are my eyes open?

168
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:57,446
No!

169
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:13,648
Morning.

170
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:21,368
Hey.

171
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:22,721
Hey, hubby.

172
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:30,530
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about that whole annulment thing.

173
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,688
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

174
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,845
Okay.

175
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:49,251
So we'll just stay married.

176
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:50,680
Yes, exactly.

177
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:54,521
And I will make everyone
call me Mrs. Geller.

178
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:57,610
Wow, this is so amazing.

179
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:01,521
I really thought I'd have to
talk you into this more.

180
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:06,246
Now I'm scared because I don't
actually think you're kidding.

181
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,330
I'm not kidding.

182
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:10,965
Look. . .

183
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:14,244
. . .I can't have three
failed marriages.

184
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:15,965
I can't, okay?

185
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:19,244
I am not gonna be that guy.

186
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,326
So what, we just
stay married forever?

187
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:29,970
How is this going
to affect you, really?

188
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:35,649
I mean, you fill some form out
once in a while. . .

189
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:39,845
. . .instead of checking the box "Miss,"
you check the box that says, "Mrs. "

190
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,850
It's right next to it.

191
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:47,446
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
You know what?

192
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:49,324
We can stay married. . .

193
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:53,923
. . .because I thought that the boxes
were far away from each other.

194
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:56,888
All right.

195
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,491
Look, just. . .

196
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:00,569
. . .please take a moment here. . .

197
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,570
. . .and think about what
you're asking of me. Okay?

198
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:08,649
I am asking you to do me a favor.

199
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:14,361
You are asking me to be your wife.

200
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:19,282
And, as my wife, I think
you should grant me this favor.

201
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,083
That kid kicked me really hard.

202
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,169
Well, you did pull his hair.

203
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:30,610
-He took my snack.
-I'm not getting into this again.

204
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:33,280
All right, you know what?
Hurts really bad.

205
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:35,448
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.

206
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,051
There. There. Okay.

207
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:48,646
-This doesn't mean anything, does it?
-No.

208
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:54,403
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?

209
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:59,049
He could be a rape-- He could be
a rapist or a killer or something.

210
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,846
Don't you think I asked him that
before he got in?

211
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:05,211
I'm not talking to you.
You go back to sleep.

212
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,765
And, you, are you a rapist?

213
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:07,768
No.

214
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,610
Do you like car games?

215
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,968
Yeah, you know
the license plate game?

216
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:13,810
I love the license plate game!

217
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:15,845
I'll play. I'll play.

218
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,008
No, you need your sleep.
Night-night.

219
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,087
Listen. I know you wanted
to talk to me. . .

220
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:31,728
. . .but I have an idea that may
make you wanna stay married.

221
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:35,130
We register. . .

222
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,971
. . .and you get to keep
all the presents.

223
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,446
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.

224
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,847
I've thought about
how to tell you this.

225
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,451
The bottom line, Ross. . .

226
00:14:48,692 --> 00:14:51,286
. . .is, we cannot stay married.

227
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:55,450
-I don't know if that's true--
-Oh, but it is.

228
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:58,441
Okay. You know what this is?

229
00:14:58,692 --> 00:15:02,048
This is a difference of opinion.

230
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:07,045
-When that happens in a marriage--
-Ross, come on!

231
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:10,722
This is not a marriage!
This is the world's worst hangover!

232
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:15,004
Ross, listen, if you do not
get this annulment, I will.

233
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,048
All right.

234
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,605
All right, I'll do it.

235
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:22,131
Thank you.

236
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:24,646
Hey, hey. . .

237
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,803
. . .is there any such thing
as an annulment shower?

238
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:35,161
There's the train station,
where I get off.

239
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:37,602
I have your address
and phone number.

240
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,724
I have your name and the fact
that you're a drifter.

241
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:43,651
So ball's pretty much
in your court.

242
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,170
All right. See you, Pheebs.

243
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,920
Come on, Pheebs, I can't
take this anymore.

244
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,360
Please talk to me.

245
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,527
Let me make it up to you.

246
00:16:04,092 --> 00:16:07,801
Ground control to Major Tom

247
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:12,841
Commencing countdown
Engines on

248
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:17,162
Take your protein pills

249
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:21,121
And put your helmet on

250
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:24,850
-This is--
-Stop it! Stop it! No!

251
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:30,007
That's not fair. You know I can't
resist that beautiful voice.

252
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:33,201
Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.

253
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:36,051
I promised you a fun
road trip with your friend. . .

254
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,852
. . .and I didn't deliver, okay?

255
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:43,807
Now I know that you think being awake
is an important part of friendship.

256
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,641
So I will strive to stay awake
for as long as I know you.

257
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:53,641
You can still sleep
at night and stuff.

258
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,046
Thank you.

259
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,962
So can we play 20 Questions now?

260
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:01,891
I got a good one.
I thought about it since Kansas.

261
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:03,888
Okay.

262
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:06,970
Is it. . .

263
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:09,447
. . .a kind of hot sandwich?

264
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:11,411
Yes.

265
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:13,970
Is it a meatball sub?

266
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,043
That is incredible!

267
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:18,329
You are the master!

268
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,251
Bug!

269
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,047
-You look like you're--
-Don't say it!

270
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:29,844
Don't even think it.

271
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,250
All right.

272
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,010
Chandler, enjoy your handful.

273
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:39,844
Should we just get married?

274
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:42,646
All the signs are telling us to do it.

275
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:44,126
I'm sick of the signs.

276
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,926
-I'm happy the way things are.
-Me too.

277
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,804
-I don't want change, do you?
-No.

278
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:52,049
Then nothing changes!
Everything stays the same!

279
00:17:52,252 --> 00:17:55,130
Go unpack. It's been three days,
and it drives me insane!

280
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,641
Jeez, relax, it's not
like we're mar--

281
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:11,528
You know, I was thinking
what if l. . .

282
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:13,485
. . .unpack here?

283
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,325
All your stuff would be here.

284
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,646
Well. . . .

285
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:23,084
What if all my stuff was here?

286
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,451
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

287
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:28,684
Doesn't make any sense.

288
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:30,451
Okay.

289
00:18:32,892 --> 00:18:35,929
What if we live together,
and you get what I'm saying?

290
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:40,645
Live together?

291
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:43,045
There've been no signs for that.

292
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:46,246
Me asking is kind of a sign.

293
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,448
Yes! Yes! Yes!

294
00:18:57,852 --> 00:19:00,082
Okay. Okay, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

295
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,089
Here's your key. Here's your key.

296
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,850
Now go out and christen it!

297
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:05,405
Go out and come back in!

298
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,046
Door hasn't been locked
in five years, but okay.

299
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:11,448
-Ready?
-Ready!

300
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:15,046
The key broke in the lock,
and I can't get in.

301
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:17,846
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!

302
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:20,612
-This isn't a sign!
-No, it's a very old key!

303
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:23,042
-It's an old key!
-Oh, my God, it's old!

304
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,041
I love you.

305
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:28,444
I love you.

306
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:32,050
Are you hugging the door right now?

307
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,441
No.

308
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:41,450
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

309
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:48,364
So did everything go all right
with the annulment?

310
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:51,370
Oh, yeah. No problems.
It's all taken care of.

311
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:52,800
Ross, thank you.

312
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,925
Do you wanna go see a movie?

313
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:57,850
-Yeah, why not?
-Pheebs?

314
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,849
Thanks, I've already seen one.

315
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:03,049
Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.

316
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,124
You wanna hear something weird?

317
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:10,651
Always.

318
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,248
I didn't get the annulment.

319
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:16,922
What?

320
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,645
We're still married.

321
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,803
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

322
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:35,321
What are you doing?

323
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:36,965
Key is stuck in the lock.

324
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:38,651
I can fix it. Hold on.

325
00:20:40,652 --> 00:20:42,051
Watch out, watch out.

326
00:20:48,092 --> 00:20:49,241
It still doesn't work.

327
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,851
I'm not finished.

328
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:04,370
Nice job, Joe.
You're quite the craftsman!

with the annulment?

No problems.
It's all taken care of.

Want to go see a movie?

Yeah, why not?

6
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:16,451
I'll get my sweater.

00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:21,251

00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:22,726
Always.

00:00:24,332 --> 00:00:26,323
I didn't get the annulment.

10
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:28,521
What?

11
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:30,125
We're still married.

12
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:33,403
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.

13
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:38,525
Do you have any gum?

14
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:44,246
Wait! Wait! Ross, can I just
talk to you for just a second?

15
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:46,124
We'll be late for the movie.

16
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:48,090
There's a cab. Taxi!

17
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:50,291
That's great.

18
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:53,052
What timing! My God, huh?
There you go.

19
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:56,332
We're gonna walk.
It's right at the Angelika.

20
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:57,891
The Angelika! Go! Go!

21
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,764
You didn't get the annulment?!

22
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:03,564
I know.

23
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:08,328
I tried, but when I got to
my lawyer's office, all I heard was:

24
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:10,966
"Three divorces! Three divorces! "

25
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:16,689
I just don't want my tombstone to read
"Ross Geller: Three Divorces. "

26
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:20,328
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone
can say whatever you want.

27
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:23,166
It can say,
"Ross Geller: Good at Marriage. "

28
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:28,330
You know what? Mine's gonna say,
"Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive. "

29
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:32,248
All I know is, I can't have
another failed marriage.

30
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:36,161
So you're gonna be married to
a girl who doesn't even know about it?

31
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:38,130
Woman. Sorry.

32
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:42,965
Okay, so I don't have it all
worked out quite yet.

33
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:45,442
Just don't say anything to Rachel.

34
00:01:45,692 --> 00:01:48,525
Rachel is one of my closest friends.

35
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:52,805
But being the only one that knows
about this makes me feel special. Okay.

36
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:58,007
Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?

37
00:01:58,212 --> 00:01:59,531
Hey, Rach!

38
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:02,171
What was that?

39
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,930
Sorry. Mix-up.

40
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,206
How was the movie?

41
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:08,724
I haven't seen it yet.

42
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,008
You'd better hurry.
The Angelika! Go!

00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:16,408

45
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:54,241
When I move in,
can I get a gumball machine?

46
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:57,325
Of course. Joey wouldn't
let you have one?

47
00:02:57,572 --> 00:03:00,723
No, when it comes to sweets,
he's surprisingly strict.

48
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,728
Did you tell him you're moving out?

49
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:07,123
No, I keep trying.
And I can get out "Joey, I have to--"

50
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:11,126
Then I lose my nerve and I finish
with "--go to the bathroom. "

51
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,131
He may think I'm sick.

52
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:17,368
I have to tell Rachel, but. . . .
We just gotta get it over with.

53
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:20,684
Next time we see them,
we'll just tell them. That's it.

54
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:23,929
That's how it'll work now?
You'll just order me around?

55
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,524
-Pretty much.
-All right.

56
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:30,530
Hey, man, you feeling better?

57
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:36,930
We have something to tell you.

58
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,126
Oh, my God!

59
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,010
You're pregnant!

60
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,125
No!

61
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,529
Look, Joe, here's the thing.

62
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:55,121
Monica and I have decided
to live together, here.

63
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,883
I'm gonna be moving out, man.

64
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:08,925
I'm really happy for you guys.
Congratulations. See you later.

65
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:10,961
Are you okay?

66
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,527
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.

67
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:16,806
Like you'd believe that.

68
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:19,727
This sucks!

69
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:22,726
I'll be across the hall.
And I promise you. . .

70
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:26,322
. . .the minute Monica and I break up,
I'm moving right back in.

71
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:29,723
If you're gonna move in with him. . .

72
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:33,163
. . .I feel it is my responsibility
to tell you the truth about him.

73
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,448
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.

74
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,290
He forgets to. . . .

75
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,448
He always, he always. . . .

76
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,403
Who am I kidding?
He's the best roommate!

77
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:51,167
Hey, Pheebs.
Have you seen Rachel?

78
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,488
-No, why?
-I have some exciting news.

79
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,127
You're pregnant.

80
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,891
No!

81
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,684
Chandler and I are moving in together.

82
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,371
Oh, that's good!

83
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:06,127
But if you were pregnant,
what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.

84
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,120
What's up?

85
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,321
Chandler and I are moving in together.

86
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,608
Oh, my God.

87
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:21,322
Oh, my little sister
and my best friend. . .

88
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:23,090
. . .shacking up.

89
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,927
That's great. That's great.

90
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:28,925
Guys, I'm happy too.

91
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,525
Okay, come here.

92
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:35,929
Big day, huh? People moving in.
People getting annulled.

93
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,769
I gotta go find Rachel.

94
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:45,130
If you see her, give her some really
bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.

95
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,687
Something bad to tell Rachel.

96
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,727
Bad news for Rachel.
What could that be?

97
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:58,127
Can you just lay off, please?

98
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:02,729
My life is an embarrassment. I should
just go live under somebody's stairs.

99
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,848
It's not that big a deal.
You'll have been divorced three times.

100
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,048
You'll have a life, you'll date--

101
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:13,245
No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
of the dating barrel now.

102
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,165
The only guys below me
will be Four-Divorce Guy. . .

103
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:18,323
. . .Murderer Guy. . .

104
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:20,170
. . .and geologists.

105
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:25,326
Ross, you're being ridiculous.
You are cute and smart and sweet.

106
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:28,609
That is much more important
than three stupid divorces.

107
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:31,690
Have you dated anyone
who's been divorced three times?

108
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,044
That's not fair. Most guys that have
been divorced three times are 60.

109
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,127
Nobody cares about this except you.

110
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,529
This embarrassment thing is
all in your head.

111
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,731
-Here, I'll show you. Come here.
-What?

112
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:50,931
Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
divorced for the third time.

113
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,531
But wouldn't you date him?

114
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,690
And if you wait right here,
I'll go get Ross.

115
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,521
Thought you were Rachel.

116
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,724
What gave me away?

117
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,441
I gotta tell her.

118
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,842
I told Ross and Phoebe.
She's the only one left.

119
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,566
It's official.
We're moving in together.

120
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:15,009
No turning back.
Are you scared? Are you?!

121
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,161
No.

122
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:19,363
That was my scariest voice.
You're brave.

123
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:25,161
The worst day.

124
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:29,803
You're finally making progress at work,
then your boss calls you Racquel.

125
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:34,931
Listen, for the first four years
of my work, everybody called me. . . .

126
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,923
-Seriously.
-I believe you.

127
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:48,121
It was in the middle of a meeting,
so no one wants to correct her.

128
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:49,970
So everyone's calling me Racquel.

129
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:53,727
By the end of the day, the mailroom
guys were calling me Rocky.

130
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:58,722
Well, I still think you're
very, very nice and very pretty.

131
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:00,681
What?

132
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,771
All yours, babe.

133
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,641
Have a seat.

134
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,842
Listen, Chandler and l. . .

135
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,324
. . .are going to live together.

136
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:15,681
Here.

137
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:20,007
Oh, my God.

138
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:22,931
That's so great!

139
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,881
I'm so happy for you guys!

140
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,127
Really?

141
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,602
And that was so sweet of you to ask.

142
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:34,521
The three of us are gonna have
such a good time living together!

143
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,327
Yes, we are.

144
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:41,449
Chandler, you'll have to watch
those long showers you take. . .

145
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,490
. . .because you know
Racquel can't be late.

146
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,400
He'll work on that.

147
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:50,724
This is so exciting!

148
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,962
Come and knock on our door

149
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,208
We'll be waiting for you

150
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:06,570
See? Once you know the stories,
it's not that bad.

151
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:10,162
First marriage: Wife's hidden
sexuality. Not my fault.

152
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,130
Second marriage:
Said the wrong name at the altar.

153
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,010
A little my fault.

154
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,170
Third marriage: They shouldn't
let you get married. . .

155
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,721
. . .when you're drunk
and have writing on your face.

156
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:24,411
Nevada's fault.

157
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:29,680
So what do you think, ladies?
Who wouldn't want to date him?

158
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:32,242
The divorces don't bother me.
I'd date him.

159
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:33,925
But not while he's still married.

160
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,083
And you, wouldn't you want to date?

161
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,169
I'm not dating at all anymore.

162
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,926
I was only dating guys
that were bad for me.

163
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,571
So I decided that--

164
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,091
Good. Good. Whatever.

165
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:46,361
And you, Meg?

166
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:49,285
Well, I don't care about
the divorces, either.

167
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,528
But I wouldn't date him.

168
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:56,127
It's just that he's obviously
still in love with this Rachel girl.

169
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:57,168
What?

170
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:01,048
She said, "He's obviously still
in love with this Rachel girl. "

171
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:06,969
This is crazy. I mean, yes,
Rachel is my good friend.

172
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,726
And I have loved her in the past. . .

173
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:12,167
. . .but now, she is just my wife.

174
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:16,408
Phoebe, will you help me out here?

175
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:19,524
Well, I thought you loved her
when you married her.

176
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:24,004
We were drunk! I would've married
Joey with that amount of alcohol.

177
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,532
You could do a lot worse
than Joey Tribbiani!

178
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:31,724
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.

179
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,049
I just don't want
to be divorced three times.

180
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,447
Now he's using
this three-divorces reason. . .

181
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:40,809
. . .because he wants to stay married
to her because he loves her.

182
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,361
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.

183
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,890
Fine. If this is what you think,
forget about. . .

184
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:49,525
. . .the whole three-divorce thing.

185
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:53,924
I'll go to my lawyer's office right now
and get this marriage annulled.

186
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,724
She means nothing to me.

187
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,769
Nothing!

188
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,121
Okay, now I wouldn't date you
because you seem a little creepy.

189
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,642
I am so attracted to him right now.

190
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,531
When will we tell Rachel
what actually will happen?

191
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:14,642
Soon.

192
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:17,525
I just couldn't before.
You saw how upset Joey got.

193
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:20,002
I couldn't do it.
She's my best friend.

194
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,645
Joey's my best friend.

195
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,328
I'm not your best friend?

196
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:26,966
You just said--!

197
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,528
Of course, you're my best friend.

198
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:32,680
Would you tell Rachel?

199
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,931
All right. At least I'm prepared.

200
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,925
Oh, yes.

201
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:43,446
-They're not for you. Are you upset?
-I am now.

202
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:47,611
Hey, roomie.

203
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,604
Okay, bye.

204
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,882
There's something important
I have to tell you.

205
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,320
Are you pregnant?

206
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,289
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.

207
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:07,124
I think there was a little
misunderstanding before.

208
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:12,482
When I said that Chandler and I
wanted to live together. . .

209
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:15,805
. . .we meant alone together.

210
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:22,729
Oh, my God. That's funny.
I can't believe I did that.

211
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:25,532
No, sweetie. You know what?
This is my fault.

212
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,330
I wasn't clear.

213
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:29,488
I'm really sorry.

214
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,448
Listen, you take as much time
as you need to move out, okay?

215
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:35,330
There's absolutely no rush.

216
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:37,721
Okay.

217
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:45,925
Don't you want a cookie?

218
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:47,927
Sure.

219
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:51,367
Thanks.

220
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:52,931
Do you need a tissue?

221
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:59,246
-Where did you get these?
-I made them.

222
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:02,046
Oh, God, they're so yummy!

223
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:08,768
It's gonna be weird when I come home
and you're not here.

224
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,724
No more Joey and Chan's.

225
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,042
No more J and C's.

226
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:16,529
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
Can't. It's not there.

227
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,723
I'll be across the hall.
We can still do all the same stuff.

228
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,691
We won't be able to have
those long talks at night. . .

229
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:25,769
. . .about our feelings and the future.

230
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:28,291
Not once did we do that.

231
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:35,564
I told Rachel that it's just
gonna be the two of us.

232
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:38,007
Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?

233
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:39,726
Really well.

234
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:41,971
Surprisingly well.

235
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:45,284
She didn't cry.
She wasn't angry or sad.

236
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:51,402
And you're upset because you
didn't make your best friend cry?

237
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,362
All I'm asking for is
a little emotion.

238
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,648
Is that too much to ask
after six years?

239
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:59,531
What, are Rachel and I
not as close as you guys?

240
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:03,691
I mean, did we not have as much fun?
Don't I deserve a few tears?

241
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,963
When we told Joey,
he cried his eyes out.

242
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,806
I did not cry my eyes out!

243
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:13,368
Come on, it's like the end of an era.

244
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:15,409
No more J-Man and Channy's!

245
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:19,562
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?

246
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:28,008
You got married again?

247
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:30,041
Yes.

248
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:34,288
So that's your second marriage
in two years?

249
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:36,722
Yes. Second in two years.

250
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:39,202
Third, overall.

251
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,571
I have been a divorce attorney
for 23 years. . .

252
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:45,770
. . .and never have I had
so much business from one client.

253
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,331
Why don't you tell me what happened?

254
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:54,841
Basically, Rachel and I were
in Vegas, and we got drunk.

255
00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:58,249
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
whose name you said. . .

256
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:00,289
. . .at the altar
in the second marriage?

257
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,130
Yes, yes, yes.

258
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:04,323
But I do not love her.

259
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,330
That's better then.

260
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:12,042
This was just a drunken mistake,
and I need to get it annulled.

261
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,321
I see.

262
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,280
Have you considered therapy?

263
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:21,761
I think just the annulment for today.

264
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,247
-There are some forms to fill out.
-Easy.

265
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:28,724
We'll need witnesses who can testify
that you were not of sound mind.

266
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,729
No problem.

267
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,009
We'll need you and Rachel
to testify before a judge.

268
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:39,722
There's no way to do this without her?

269
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,681
Because I kind of already told her
it was taken care of.

270
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,803
Of course you did.

271
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:51,810
Look, you can't get an annulment
unless you and Rachel are both there.

272
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:56,569
What about someone
who looks like Rachel?

273
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,969
I will think about the therapy.

274
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:11,530
So I was thinking that maybe we
should start dividing up our stuff.

275
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:13,531
Okay.

276
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:15,889
No point in dragging it out.

277
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:19,404
Dragging out the long process
of you moving out. . .

278
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,688
. . .and us not living together anymore.

279
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:30,920
What about this? Who gets this?

280
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:34,727
I don't know if I want it because
it might be too many memories.

281
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:37,811
-What is that?
-I don't know.

282
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,925
How about this?
I want you to have the big plate.

283
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,049
Wow, Monica, thanks.
I love this plate.

284
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,045
Something to remember me by.

285
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,806
Mon, you're not dying.
I'm just moving out.

286
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:58,121
We're gonna see each other
all the time.

287
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:01,165
But still, it's a big change.

288
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:04,404
The end of an era, you might say.

289
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:09,009
Are you okay? You're not blinking.

290
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:14,165
I'm fine. I was thinking about
how it's an end of an era.

291
00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:16,125
Oh, all right.

292
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,925
But I gotta say, I don't think
six years counts as an era.

293
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:24,925
An era is defined as
a significant period of time.

294
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:28,403
It was significant for me.
Maybe it wasn't significant to you!

295
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,888
-What is the matter with you?
-What is the matter with you?!

296
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,765
Why aren't you more upset?

297
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,924
Aren't you gonna be sad
that we're not living together?

298
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,049
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?

299
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:43,091
Monica, all right.
But don't get mad at me.

300
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,246
It's just a little hard to believe.

301
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,325
What's hard to believe?

302
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:53,531
I mean, it's you guys.
You do this kind of stuff, you know?

303
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,685
You were gonna get married in Vegas,
and then you backed out.

304
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:02,164
I'm not upset because I don't see you
going through with it. I'm sorry.

305
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,929
It's going to happen.

306
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:11,685
Chandler will move in here.

307
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,645
-But l--
-I know, just let me finish, okay?

308
00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:19,161
This isn't something that we just
impulsively decided to do in Vegas.

309
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,801
This is something
that we both really want.

310
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:25,801
And it is going to happen.

311
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:27,931
It is?

312
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,240
Really?

313
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,284
Yeah, sweetie.

314
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:38,766
You mean, we're not gonna
live together anymore?

315
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:46,851
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

316
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:48,770
I'm gonna miss you.

317
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:51,610
I mean, it's the end of an era!

318
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,245
I know!

319
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:58,887
-Okay, bye.
-Oh, no.

320
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,767
So did you get the annulment?

321
00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:02,768
I couldn't.

322
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,963
I knew it. Because you love Rachel.

323
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:08,530
It's not that.
Annulments are more complicated--

324
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,922
Complicated because of the love.

325
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,840
I do not love Rachel.

326
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:15,923
I'm telling her
about the whole thing. . .

327
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:19,244
. . .so we can get this marriage
annulled as fast as possible.

328
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,369
Would I do that if I loved her?

329
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:24,405
I've never been more convinced
of your love for her.

330
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:28,725
I do not have feelings
for Rachel, okay?

331
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:34,047
Oh, what's wrong?

332
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,123
Monica and Chandler are
moving in here. . .

333
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:40,011
. . .and I have to move out
and everything is changing.

334
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,522
Oh, my God, come here, come here.
It's okay.

335
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:45,962
Everything's gonna be okay.

336
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:46,968
Thank you.

337
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:49,124
Of course.

338
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:01,763
So Ross and Rachel got married.

339
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,646
Monica and Chandler
almost got married.

340
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,645
You think we should hook up?

341
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:09,841
Oh, we do.

342
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,491
But not just yet.

343
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,803
Really? Well, when?

344
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:20,570
Well, first Chandler and Monica
will get married. . .

345
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:22,928
. . .and be filthy rich, by the way.

346
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:24,565
But it won't work out.

347
00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,321
I know.

348
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:30,127
Then I'll marry Chandler
for the money.

349
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:33,642
And you'll marry Rachel
and have the beautiful kids.

350
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:35,126
Great.

351
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:38,161
But then we ditch them
and we get married.

352
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,246
We'll have Chandler's money
and Rachel's kids.

353
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:45,326
Getting custody will be easy
because of Rachel's drinking problem.

354
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,601
What about Ross?

355
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,848
I don't want to go
into the whole thing.

356
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:52,322
But we have words and I kill him.

Check it out, this is unbelievable!

2
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:10,289
Joey's been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

3
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:17,324
You trying to kill me?

4
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,610
I want to ask you something.

5
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:24,682
Since I'm moving out,
and you're so beautiful. . .

6
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:26,891
. . .how about I move in with you?

7
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:30,169
That would be great,
but what do we do about Denise?

8
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,210
-Who's Denise?
-My roommate.

9
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:34,367
Your roommate?

10
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:36,563
Yes, Denise. Denise!

11
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,442
What is with the secrecy, Phoebe?

12
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:42,643
What about Denise? She cute?

13
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:46,443
How can you have a roommate
that we don't know about?

14
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:48,922
Because you never listen
to what I say.

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,043
I talk about her all the time.
Denise!

16
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:56,284
I'm gonna have an extra room
over at my place.

17
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:57,288
That's true.

18
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:01,929
Move in with me. We can stay up
late talking, and watch movies.

19
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:04,123
You know about
naked Thursdays, right?

20
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,010
Yeah, yeah. I think
I'll find my own place.

21
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:12,927
Hey! I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

22
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,089
The One With Ross' Denial

24
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:57,085
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

25
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,401
Oh, that.

26
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:00,650
She took it really well.

27
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,487
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-No.

28
00:02:04,012 --> 00:02:05,843
Because you're in love with her.

29
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:10,091
I am not in love with her. She was
upset about having to move out.

30
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:13,090
If she knew we were still married,
she'd have been more upset.

31
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:15,482
So I comforted her.
As a friend.

32
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:17,125
You "comforted her"?

33
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:19,010
Nothing.
I just gave her a hug.

34
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,847
A classic sign of love,
the hug.

35
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:24,449
It's also a sign of friendship.

36
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,569
Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson. "

37
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,171
It was a hug.

38
00:02:29,412 --> 00:02:32,210
Did you, or did you not,
smell her hair?

39
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,370
Smell her hair?

40
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:36,406
What if I did?

41
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:40,440
Ninety percent of a woman's
pheromones come out of her head.

42
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:42,290
That's why women are shorter.

43
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:46,050
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

44
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:49,047
Come on, Ross,
you're a scientist.

45
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:52,483
I was hugging her as a friend.

46
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:54,962
It's not my fault
her hair got in my face.

47
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,965
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all. . .all. . .

48
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:00,405
. . .coconutty.

49
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:05,364
What? It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

50
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:08,086
Maybe it means
I have feelings for coconuts.

51
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:13,205
Okay, but be careful. Rachel's not
in the same place you are.

52
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:16,205
If the place you're
referring to is being in love. . .

53
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:20,883
. . .she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

54
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,685
I didn't understand that.

55
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:28,602
Maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

56
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,367
-A guy just called for you.
-Who was it?

57
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:39,649
I don't know. How about
"Thanks for taking the message"?

58
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:44,087
When you move in. . .

59
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:47,682
. . .Rachel's room will be empty.
Let's talk about what to do with it.

60
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,686
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room. . .

61
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:54,971
. . .with a mahogany sleigh bed and
bedside tables with fresh flowers.

62
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:59,365
And comment cards so people could
tell us how great their stay was.

63
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,528
I really haven't
thought about it that much.

64
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:07,086
Well, I like that idea. . .obviously.

65
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:10,924
I was thinking maybe. . .
maybe it could be a game room.

66
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,410
You can buy old arcade games, like
Space lnvaders and Asteroids. . .

67
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:18,445
. . .for $200. The real ones.
The big, big, big ones!

68
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:21,367
No.

69
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:25,449
You mean "No" as in:

70
00:04:25,852 --> 00:04:29,606
"What an interesting idea. Let's
discuss it before we reject it. "

71
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,885
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:36,285
Interesting idea. But no.

73
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:38,971
So that's it?

74
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,761
I just don't think arcade games
go in a beautiful guest room. . .

75
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:45,048
. . .filled with antiques.

76
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:48,642
Which is why Asteroids is
perfect. It's the oldest game.

77
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,328
What's wrong with
a beautiful guest room?

78
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:54,443
I'm not against it.

79
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:58,281
Especially since everybody we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

80
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:00,680
Are you mocking me?

81
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:03,281
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

82
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:12,323
Monica and I
had a stupid fight.

83
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:15,803
You're still moving in together,
right? My ad came out today.

84
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:20,122
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly. "

85
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:24,280
Nice.

86
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:28,889
I figured it'd be more interesting
to have a female roommate.

87
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:32,607
Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

88
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:36,248
And what's more different than me, a
guy who's not 1 9. . .

89
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,841
. . .than a girl who is 1 9?

90
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,730
Not just a hatrack, my friend.

91
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,530
Pheebs, I have to ask you--

92
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,251
I'm swamped right now.

93
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:51,682
You're just staring into space.

94
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:54,526
I'm trying to move that pencil.

95
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:57,444
-This one?
-It worked!

96
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,723
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing
is a nightmare.

97
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:06,527
Anything I can afford comes with
a roommate who is a freak. Look.

98
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:12,003
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly. "

99
00:06:14,732 --> 00:06:17,041
There's nothing. This city is full.

100
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,321
Wait! Look at this!

101
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:22,525
"Two bedroom, two bath. Must be
nonsmoker. Satan worshipers okay. "

102
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,731
Yeah, but it's on the
ground floor.

103
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:33,202
-Rach, you still looking for a place?
-Yeah, why?

104
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:37,731
This guy, Warren, from the museum
is going on a dig for two years.

105
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:42,126
He's got this great place he needs
to sublet. You interested?

106
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:45,642
Great! I'd love to live at Warren's.
I love Warren!

107
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:48,203
-Thank you!
-Don't thank me.

108
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:51,848
Thank the volcano that erupted
thousands of years ago. . .

109
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:55,641
. . .killing, but perfectly preserving,
an entire civilization.

110
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:58,651
Here's Warren's number.

111
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:03,926
This is great. I'm gonna
call him right now! Thank you!

112
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:08,964
Okay, you go call him.

113
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:11,321
I saw it.

114
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,963
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:18,130
I'm talking about what you already
know but won't admit.

116
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:20,641
You love her again. You re-love her.

117
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,328
I do not re-love her.

118
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:26,132
I can't believe
you won't just admit it.

119
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,731
Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.

120
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:33,766
We're just friends now.
Why would I do anything stupid?

121
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,882
The apartment
is already subletted.

122
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:40,004
It's hopeless.
I'll never find anything.

123
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:41,647
Live with me.

124
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:43,047
-What?
-What?!

125
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,051
What?

126
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,531
Are you serious?

127
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:57,164
I would love to live with you.
That's great. Thank you.

128
00:07:57,452 --> 00:07:59,647
I'm just glad I could help you out.

129
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:05,729
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so, not stupid.

130
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,841
Ross, you have no idea
what this means to me.

131
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:14,965
I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me. You're my hero.

132
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:18,884
Hero? I don't know.
Well, all right.

133
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:24,007
I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.

134
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,169
Oh, please.

135
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,492
You're gonna say things now,
aren't you?

136
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,844
No. No, I won't.

137
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:40,249
But I should tell you this.

138
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,371
The same thing happened to my
roommate, Denise.

139
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:45,802
She moved in with a guy
who was secretly married to her.

140
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:49,647
He said he didn't love her, but he
really did. And it just blew up.

141
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:52,446
And that's how she ended up
living with me.

142
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:56,925
Okay, that's a lie.

143
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:05,322
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need a game room.

144
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:09,440
I only played those games because I
couldn't get girls. Now I can get--

145
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:12,487
Now I have you.

146
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:16,162
No, not that I think I have you. . .

147
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:20,525
. . .or think of you as property
in any sort of way. I see women. . . .

148
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,211
Stop it, Chandler.

149
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:24,727
I'm sorry too.

150
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,931
-Really?
-Yeah. Oh, yes.

151
00:09:29,732 --> 00:09:32,963
We can think of something
to do with the room together.

152
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:36,841
Great idea. We can easily think of
a way for us both to enjoy the room.

153
00:09:37,172 --> 00:09:38,400
Totally.

154
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,841
-We don't have to decide now.
-Good.

155
00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:49,365
Let's think about changes
we can make in the living room.

156
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:50,802
Changes?

157
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:55,368
We'll have to move some
furniture to make room for my chair.

158
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,882
You're bringing the Barcalounger
over here?

159
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:01,481
Is that a problem?

160
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:06,370
It's just that they're a set
and should stay together.

161
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,682
That's cool.
I'll bring them both over.

162
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:12,210
You're taking them away
from their home.

163
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:16,801
I get it. I get nothing. Nothing
here is mine. Everything is yours.

164
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:20,328
I'll get up in the morning, put on
your clothes and go off to work!

165
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:25,050
Yeah, that's it. Everything
will be mine. Nothing will be yours.

166
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,284
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.

167
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:29,648
It doesn't match.
Where will it go?

168
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:31,450
In the game room!

169
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:34,803
It is not my fault your
chairs are incredibly ugly.

170
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:36,411
That's fine.

171
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,807
I won't bring the chairs.
I won't bring anything!

172
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:42,288
I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance
over here at grandma's place!

173
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:46,645
Everything on your application
looks really good.

174
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,524
Just one last question.

175
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,849
Will your friends be over here,
partying and hanging out?

176
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:53,923
Don't worry.
I'm not a party girl.

177
00:10:56,892 --> 00:10:59,167
Don't just be blurting stuff out.

178
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,170
I want you to really think
about your answers.

179
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:07,201
Call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.

180
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:10,724
Ignore him. He's just some
guy who wants the apartment.

181
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:13,002
But he's not going to get it.

182
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:15,849
You took down the shower curtain?

183
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:17,724
That thing was a hazard!

184
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,411
I'm very safety conscious.

185
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:32,844
I was just clearing some space
for your stuff.

186
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,042
Thanks.

187
00:11:34,252 --> 00:11:38,928
But listen, Monica and Chandler had a
big fight and they're not moving in.

188
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,966
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?

189
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:47,522
No, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.

190
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:50,087
Over a stupid room?

191
00:11:50,452 --> 00:11:54,684
I feel kind of bad for them, but now
I don't have to move in here!

192
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:57,480
Oh, no. Yeah,
that part's great.

193
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:02,081
What's all this
about you guys fighting?

194
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,606
Is this really over a room?

195
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,087
That is so silly.

196
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:10,601
We can handle this.

197
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,404
Apparently not.

198
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:17,481
And I can't stand by and watch
two people I care about so much. . .

199
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,804
. . .be hurt by something
that is so silly.

200
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:25,850
Enough of the silliness.

201
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,610
Tell her to stop being silly.

202
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,328
Two very good points.

203
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,890
I've known you both a long time.

204
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:43,608
And I've never seen either of you
one-millionth as happy. . .

205
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:45,968
. . .as you've been
since you got together.

206
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:50,442
Do you really want
to throw that all away over a room?

207
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:52,763
That is so silly.

208
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:56,091
What's more important, love. . .

209
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,324
. . .or silliness?

210
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:02,041
Well, we are fond of the silliness.

211
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:05,041
But we also have a soft spot
for the love.

212
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:08,320
-Love is the best medicine.
-That's "Iaughter. "

213
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:09,760
-Why do you do it?
-I don't know.

214
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:19,004
Now, Chandler, you want
to live with Monica, right?

215
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,360
Yeah, I do.

216
00:13:21,612 --> 00:13:23,887
And, Mon, you want
to live with Chandler?

217
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:25,128
Yes.

218
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:28,369
A verbal contract is binding
in the state of New York!

219
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,723
So I understand you're
looking for a place?

220
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,248
No, I'm staying put.

221
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:50,163
I was going to offer you
my apartment.

222
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,730
Why? Where you going?

223
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:55,286
I don't know.

224
00:13:59,932 --> 00:14:01,604
You won't believe it.

225
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,723
Monica and Chandler are
moving in again.

226
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,730
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?

227
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:11,247
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.

228
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,450
Yeah. You know, about that. . . .

229
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:21,007
I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything. . .

230
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:23,766
. . .but don't you think
it'll be weird?

231
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,969
Why? Why would it. . . .
Why would it be weird?

232
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:32,292
Well, you know,
because of us.

233
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:34,331
Because of our history.

234
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,281
No!

235
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,490
No, no!

236
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:42,002
It would only be weird
if we were still in "that place. "

237
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:45,289
Are you still in that place?

238
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:46,841
No, not at all.

239
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:48,002
Good. Me neither.

240
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:50,809
So it's not a problem.

241
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:54,004
We're just two friends
who happen to be roommates.

242
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:57,489
Okay, but eventually
you and I will be dating.

243
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,243
Really? We are?

244
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:05,768
Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend
and you'll have a girlfriend.

245
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:10,210
That'd be great.

246
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:14,362
But if you think it'll be okay,
we'll just work out a system.

247
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:18,008
It'll be like in college.
I'll hang a sign on the door:

248
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:20,851
"Come back later.
I'm getting lucky. "

249
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:28,321
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

250
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:34,128
So are you sure about
this whole moving-in thing?

251
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,811
It's a really big step.
And what's the rush?

252
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,166
That's very funny.

253
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:47,091
He's being silly because
he knows we enjoy the silliness.

254
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:53,205
No, I'm serious.
Think about it. You move in.

255
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:58,208
You start fighting over game rooms.
Next thing you know, you break up.

256
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:01,370
It was just a stupid fight
about a room.

257
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:03,290
There are no stupid fights!

258
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,688
This isn't about the room.

259
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:10,123
This is about
what the room represents.

260
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:14,247
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you!

261
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:18,041
-I'm not so worried.
-Me neither.

262
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,044
Fine. It's your life!

263
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,283
I just don't want
to see you break up.

264
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:27,041
Which you will do
if you move in together.

265
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:32,250
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.

266
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:33,885
Don't do it!

267
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:41,361
-You still want to move in together?
-Of course.

268
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:42,887
Ross didn't scare you?

269
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,208
Scared me out of wanting
to live with him.

270
00:16:46,892 --> 00:16:49,042
-I gotta show you something.
-Okay.

271
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:54,846
Oh, my God!
Someone's killed Square Man!

272
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:58,604
The Barcalounger can go here.

273
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:02,361
You can see the TV, and it's still
walking distance to the kitchen.

274
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:04,284
Oh, that's so sweet.

275
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,481
I want to show you
something too.

276
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:10,082
You know those big road signs
that say "merge"?

277
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:15,125
I thought we could get one of those
signs and hang it over our bed.

278
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,442
Because that's you and I together.

279
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,167
"Merge! "

280
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:24,770
-I love that!
-Really?

281
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:25,848
"No! "

282
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:31,927
I found you in my bed

283
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:35,326
How'd you wind up there?

284
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:38,200
You are a mystery

285
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:40,846
Little black curly hair

286
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,726
Little black, little black,
little black

287
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,685
Little black curly hair

288
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:59,765
If you want to receive e-mails
about my upcoming shows. . .

289
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,845
. . .please give me money
so I can buy a computer.

290
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:09,971
Where are the other guys?

291
00:18:10,252 --> 00:18:12,607
Well, Monica and Chandler
are occupied.

292
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,366
-Fighting?
-The other thing.

293
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:18,003
It's great they worked things out.

294
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,885
There's no breaking them up,
is there?

295
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,009
Can I borrow the key to your house
so I can go make a copy?

296
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,771
-Here.
-Thank you.

297
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:31,930
Are you sure? Once I make
a copy, there's no turning back.

298
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:36,884
Yeah, I'm sure. Now get out
of here before I change my mind.

299
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:46,131
You think moving in
with Rachel is a good idea?

300
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,647
I've been back and forth.

301
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,481
Well, maybe you should go back.

302
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:54,083
She moves in,
and before you know it. . .

303
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:56,362
. . .you're right where you don't
want to be, back together.

304
00:18:56,652 --> 00:19:00,611
I don't think so. She's already
talking about dating other guys.

305
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:04,691
That's not going to work out.
She'll come home all weepy. . .

306
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:08,163
. . .and you'll be telling her, "Oh,
that's okay. You'll find someone. "

307
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:10,647
And then, bam! She finds you!

308
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:15,327
Maybe you're right.

309
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:18,968
Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

310
00:19:19,212 --> 00:19:20,281
Is that what you want?

311
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,325
Is that what I want?

312
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:23,681
Yes.

313
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,041
Here she comes. I'm gonna
make your life much easier.

314
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:32,091
The place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

315
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,441
Or not.

316
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,050
Why don't you move in with me?

317
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:38,926
Whoa, Joey!

318
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:45,083
Look, I know I scared you with
that whole naked-Thursdays thing. . .

319
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:48,923
. . .but we don't have to do that.

320
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,322
It would be easier
to move across the hall.

321
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:57,648
Unless you're thinking about
naked Wednesdays.

322
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,485
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day!

323
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:10,402
Come on in.
Thanks for coming back.

324
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:13,481
There's a lot of people
interested in the room.

325
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,764
But I've narrowed it down,
and you're one of the finalists.

326
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:22,041
Before I decide, I want to be
sure our personalities match.

327
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,885
So I made up a little test.

328
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:27,641
I'll say a word, and you say
the first thing that comes to mind.

329
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,207
-I can do that.
-Okay, here we go.

330
00:20:30,572 --> 00:20:31,971
-Pillow.
-Fight.

331
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,924
Very good.

332
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:36,767
"G. "

333
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,167
-String?
-Excellent!

334
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:44,811
Doggy.

335
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:47,521
Kitten?

336
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:48,881
Sorry!

337
00:20:51,452 --> 00:20:53,682
So close, though. Bye-bye!

Monica, which of all of this
kitchen stuff is mine?

2
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:07,491
This bottle opener.

3
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:10,601
-And. . .?
-And it's a magnet.

4
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:17,165
Look at that!

5
00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:20,321
How weird is that?
You're moving in with me. . .

6
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:23,490
. . .and you have the one thing
I don't have.

7
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:27,488
It's like, in a way,
you complete me.

8
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,165
-Kitchen.
-What?

9
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:34,926
You complete me kitchen, matey!

10
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:38,884
I know what you're thinking.

11
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:43,566
That she'll move in with you, then
fall in love with you, and then. . .

12
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:47,327
. . .when she finds out you're already
married, she'll be happy.

13
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:50,291
You know? You're just very sad.

14
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:53,002
Oh, my God!

15
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:59,522
I see what this is.
You are in love with Rachel!

16
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:04,521
It all adds up! You're obsessed
with her. It's always:

17
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:08,611
"What will you do about Rachel?
Why are you moving in with Rachel?

18
00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:13,363
When will you confess your secret
marriage to Rachel?" You want her!

19
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:18,328
Saved by the bell.

20
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:23,967
Aren't these candlesticks mine?

21
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:25,406
No, I bought those.

22
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:27,047
Oh, right. I forgot.

23
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:30,091
That you're a liar!

24
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:36,201
That's great! I'll be there Monday.
And thank you again.

25
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:41,165

. . .did he. . .

31
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:49,202
. . .say?

32
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:54,845
Remember that paper I had published
last year on sediment flow rate?

33
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,401
-They loved it.
-Well, who wouldn't?

34
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,327
I know!

35
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:04,045
Anyway, they asked me
to be a guest lecturer.

36
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:08,649
It's temporary, but if they like me,
it could lead to a full-time job.

37
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:12,168
How great would that look
on the mailbox? Professor Geller.

38
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:14,084
Professor and Mrs.

39
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:17,361
And Mrs.?

40
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,088
You and Ross are still married.

41
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:23,841
What?

42
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,445
Just kidding!

43
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:29,967
Oh, God!

44
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,641
Saved your ass.

What's the matter?

48
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,688
You know that psychic I see?

49
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:23,163
She told me I'm gonna die this week,
so I'm bummed.

50
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:30,247
I know you don't know about readings,
but that's the worst you can get.

51
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,927
That's crazy.

52
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,611
She'd say that to you?

53
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:36,444
You don't believe her, do you?

54
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:39,445
I don't know. She said
that I'd have triplets. . .

55
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:42,286
. . .but she also said one of them
would be black.

56
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,321
Just out of curiosity,
did she say how you'd go?

57
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:49,171
She didn't tell me I'd die
till the end of the session.

58
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:51,721
I wasn't gonna waste
a whole other hour there!

59
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,729
I've only got a week left.

60
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:56,247
I've really gotta start living now!

61
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:01,327
Hey, everyone.

62
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,967
Well, today's my first lecture. . .

63
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,045
. . .and I wanted to try it out
on you guys. Do you mind?

64
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:12,006
No, that'd be great!

65
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:26,241
"There are three primary theories
concerning sediment flow rate.

66

Each of these theories can be further
subcategorized into two. . . "

67
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:32,925
This is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.

Are there naked chicks
on that piece of paper?

70
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,288
No. Why?

71
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:51,371
I never seen a guy stare so hard at
something that didn't have chicks on it.

Why don't you open with a joke?

78
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:21,328
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.

79
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,324
Wait a minute, hold the phone.

80
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,362
You're not talking
about Chuckles University?

81
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,245
Come on, we're kidding.

82
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:32,403
You know what might make it
less boring?

83
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:33,687
Thank you.

84
00:05:34,572 --> 00:05:36,608
Some visual aids.

85
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:40,369
-You know what's a good visual aid?
-Don't say naked chicks.

86
00:05:41,372 --> 00:05:42,168
Why not?

87
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:46,171
I don't even know why I talk
to you guys about it.

88
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,609
I'm just gonna do it on my own,
with no naked chicks.

89
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:52,525
That's the way I did it
till I was 1 9.

90
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:00,521
Any good mail?

91
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,529
Something from
the Screen Actors Guild.

92
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:06,731
It's probably a residual check.
Can you open it? I got. . . .

93
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:10,009
"Benefits lapsed. "

94
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:11,321
That's weird.

95
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:14,524
I don't remember being in a movie
called Benefits Lapsed.

96
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:19,571
It's not a check. Your health
insurance expired because. . .

97
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,122
-. . .you didn't work enough last year.
-Let me see that.

98
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,128
Oh, I can't believe this!

99
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,651
This sucks!

100
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:31,325
When I had insurance,
I could get hit by a bus. . .

101
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:33,250
. . .or catch on fire, you know?

102
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:36,211
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?

103
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:39,961
I'm sorry. There's never
a good time to have to. . .

104
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:42,282
. . .stop catching on fire.

105
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,166
All right, well. . .

106
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:47,642
. . .I guess I gotta go see my agent.

107

Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street.

108

"Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street. "

109
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:03,444
Hey, you're still alive!

110
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,526
How are you feeling?

111
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:09,849
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.

112
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,930
Oh, by the way, do you think you--

113
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:17,640
What are you doing?

114
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,522
Preparing you for--
Didn't you think I was dead?

115
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:22,410
Did that not come off?

116
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:26,847
Yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.

117
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,845
-You wanna lie down?
-Yeah, thanks.

118
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:31,845
Can you do me a favor?

119
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,128
Wake me up in a couple hours.

120
00:07:34,332 --> 00:07:36,129
You know, if you can.

121
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:45,771
Did you take these back?

122
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:50,610
I liked them so much
that I bought some for myself.

123
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:52,928
They're really great, aren't they?

124
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:54,167
I love them.

125
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:56,647
Nice try.

126
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:01,361
How'd the lecture go?

127
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:03,523
It went great.

128
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:07,441
And I didn't need any jokes
or naked chicks either.

129
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:10,650
That's great. I'm sorry
we weren't supportive before.

130
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,770
I knew I just had to let
the material speak for itself.

131
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:16,970
Everyone's all, "Ross, you have
to be funny and sexy. "

132
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:19,282
Well, I proved them wrong!

133
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:23,125
And now I'm gonna pass
the news on to Joey and Chandler.

134
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,966
-That you're not funny or sexy?
-That's right!

135
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:35,047
-Hey, Estelle, listen--
-Well, well, well.

136
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,811
Joey Tribbiani.

137
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:39,008
So you came back, huh?

138
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,641
They think they can do better,
but they all. . .

139
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:44,565
. . .come crawling back to Estelle.

140
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,923
What are you talking about?

141
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:50,721
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.

142
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:51,768
Really?

143
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:56,329
Oh, well, no harm no foul.

144
00:08:56,892 --> 00:09:00,965
Look, you gotta get me some work.
I lost my health insurance.

145
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:04,329
All right, first thing we gotta do:
damage control.

146
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:06,847
-Why?
-Well, I think. . .

147
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,162
. . .someone out there. . .

148
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:12,643
. . .may have been bad-mouthing you
all over town.

149
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:15,761
The bastard!

150
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,729
So Estelle lined up a bunch
of auditions for me tomorrow.

151
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:31,765
And I'll have my health insurance
back in no time.

152
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:36,282
That's great, but shouldn't you
be on the toilet right now?

153
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:42,130
What's wrong with you?

154
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,128
Nothing.

155
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,769
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

156
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:50,924
And then I passed out. . .

157
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:53,128
. . .and I haven't been able
to stand up since.

158
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,085
But I don't think
it's anything serious.

159
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:59,045
This sounds like a hernia.
Go to the doctor.

160
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:00,088
No way.

161
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:04,769
If I go to the doctor, it'll be for
this thing sticking out of my stomach!

162
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:09,966
That's a hernia.

163
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:12,766
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

164
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:15,210
Damn you, 1 5s!

165
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:21,527
The lecture doesn't end
for 1 5 minutes.

166
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,922
-We can sneak in and watch.
-Good.

167
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:26,811
Oh, hey, look!
There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.

168
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:27,962
I was a Kappa.

169
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,850
Hey, sisters!

170
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,969
Wow, we really are bitches.

171
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:41,444
Right. So when Rigby got his samples
back from the laboratory. . .

172
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,168
. . .he made a startling discovery.

173
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:50,570
What he believed to be igneous
was, in fact, sedimentary.

174
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,650
Imagine his consternation when--

175
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:00,448
Oh, bloody hell.

176
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:06,442
What the hell are you doing?

177
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:08,570
Look, I was nervous.

178
00:11:08,812 --> 00:11:11,531
You guys had me all worried
I was gonna be boring.

179
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:14,963
I got up there and they were
all, like, staring at me.

180
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:18,807
I opened my mouth and this
British accent just came out.

181
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,523
Yeah, and not a very good one.

182
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,529
Will you, please. . .?

183
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,569
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.

184
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:28,167
I'm a paleontology professor here.

185
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:31,201
Do you have a moment
to talk about your lecture?

186
00:11:31,412 --> 00:11:34,131
I'm sorry, I've got plans
with my sister.

187
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:36,249
Monica Geller.

188
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:40,963
Right. Will you excuse us
for one moment?

189
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:44,011
-What are you doing?
-You can have an accent, but I can't?

190
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:47,046
Top of the morning to you, laddies!

191
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,846
Would you just please stop?

192
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:54,931
Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice
this time of year.

193
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:12,803
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?

194
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:15,647
Sit down!

195
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:18,768
Will you go to the hospital?

196
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,650
Hernia operations cost. . .

197
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:22,530
. . .a lot probably, okay?

198
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:27,123
Besides, it's getting darker and more
painful. That means it's healing.

199
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:29,724
Look, I'll loan you the money.

200
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:33,169
Just go to the hospital and
let's just get that thing. . .

201
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:34,891
. . .pushed back in.

202
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:38,569
Thank you, but it'd take me
forever to pay you back.

203
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:40,723
I don't want that
hanging over my head.

204
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,048
Besides, when my
insurance kicks in. . .

205
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:46,045
. . .I can get all the free
operations I want.

206
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:49,204
I'll probably start
with that laser eye surgery.

207
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,128
What's going on?

208
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:59,002
Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing
a little laser eye surgery won't fix.

209
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,571
I'm telling you,
if I put my hand on my stomach. . .

210
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:04,882
. . .it doesn't hurt that bad.

211
00:13:05,332 --> 00:13:07,004
Hey, maybe you'll die!

212
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,209
Chandler, I'm scared.

213
00:13:11,612 --> 00:13:13,125
No, we can go together.

214
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:17,166
Just don't wait too long, because I'm
out of here sometime before Friday.

215
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:19,725
But I don't want to die.

216
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:23,049
It'll be fun. We'll come back
and haunt these guys!

217
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,928
-Give me them!
-No, they are mine!

218
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:33,123
-You stole them from me!
-You stole them from me!

219
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:34,321
Give me them!

220
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:38,851
Just wanna each take one?

221
00:13:39,532 --> 00:13:41,966
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.

222
00:13:43,612 --> 00:13:46,570
Look, I really need
some help, okay?

223
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:50,043
Why did I have to speak
in a British accent?

224
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:51,648
What do I do?

225
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:54,969
Why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.

226
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:58,409
People will think you're
adjusting to life in America.

227
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,723
Come on.
No one will even notice.

228
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:03,366
They're probably not even
listening to you.

229
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,765
They're not listening to me?

230
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,446
Of course they're listening to you.

231
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,331
Everybody listens to you.

232
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:15,004
Monica, do you think I should
try this phasing-out thing?

233
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:16,731
I think you look fine.

234
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,125
Whenever you're ready.

235
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:25,240
Hey, Timmy.

236
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,721
I've got a surprise. . .

237
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:30,041
. . .for you.

238
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:31,521
Hold it.
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,720
The surprise is a new swing set.
If you could play it less intense.

240
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:37,763
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.

241
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,764
Just hold on one second.

242
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,203
Hey, Timmy.

243
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:51,609
I've got a surprise for you!

244
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:52,762
Oh, my God!

245
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:01,929
So that's why I feed my dog
Purina One.

246
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:04,170
Pick up a bag today.

247
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:08,446
-That's where you pick up the bag.
-Exactly.

248
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:13,400
The line is, "Pick up a bag,"
so you need to pick up the bag.

249
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,570
Or I could just point to it.

250
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:21,600
Purina One. Point to a bag today.

251
00:15:25,612 --> 00:15:27,011
I didn't get it, did l?

252
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:34,571
Joey Tribbiani.

253
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:37,007
I'm here to audition for "Man. "

254
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:39,321
You mean "Dying Man. "

255
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,724
-Do it one more time.
-Really? Really? Okay.

256
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:54,569
Hello, Ross? This is Dr. McNeely
from the Fake Accent University.

257
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:57,121
We'd like you
to come onboard full-time!

258
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:03,646
Listen to this!

259
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:06,328
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.

260
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,806
Really? How do you know?

261
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,371
My psychic is dead!

262
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,443
She must have read
the cards wrong.

263
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,171
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,010
Better her than me.

265
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:19,409
Hey, let's bake cookies!

266
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:27,207
Listen, I'm really glad
you got the part.

267
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:30,644
Are you sure you can do this?

268
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,964
And thanks for coming with me.

269
00:16:33,212 --> 00:16:36,010
And thanks again
for helping me take a shower.

270
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:41,443
Now, is that
"never talking about it again"?

271
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,091
We're ready for you.

272
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,246
This is Alex.
He'll be playing your son.

273
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:49,527
Hi, Alex.

274
00:16:49,772 --> 00:16:52,650
As you can see, my hands
are not in my pants.

275
00:16:57,172 --> 00:17:00,164
All right, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line. . .

276
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:03,927
. . . "Take good care of your mama, son,"
that's your cue to cry. Got it?

277
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:05,571
All right, let's do this.

278
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:11,848
Scene five, take one.

279
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,520
And action!

280
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:16,882
Take good care of your mama, son.

281
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,842
Take good care of your mama, son.

282
00:17:30,612 --> 00:17:31,681
Come on, son.

283
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:34,208
Your mama's good people.

284
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:35,922
Cut!

285
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:38,845
Alex, remember, you're
supposed to cry.

286
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:41,128
Can you cry for us this time?

287
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:43,443
All right. From the top.

288
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:48,367
Scene five, take two.

289
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:50,844
Take 36 is up.

290
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:53,450
Let's try this again.

291
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:54,927
You ready, Joe?

292
00:17:55,132 --> 00:17:57,726
One thing, is it all right
if I scream. . .

293
00:17:57,932 --> 00:17:59,763
. . .right up until
you say, "Action"?

294
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,442
Sure.

295
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:06,970
-Action!
-Take good care of your mama, son.

296
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:10,681
Cut!

297
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:16,010
I'm sorry. Why don't you lift up your
shirt? Take a look at this, kiddo.

298
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:23,169
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!

299
00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,966
-Hello, is Ross there?
-No, he's not. Can I take a message?

300
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,567
Yes, this is Russell,
Ross ' divorce lawyer.

301
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:39,010
Since I haven't heard from him, I
assume he's giving the marriage a try.

302
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:41,005
Ross got married again?

303
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,923
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.

304
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:49,730
Phasing it out.

305
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:54,644
"So without retesting their results
in the laboratory. . .

306
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:58,204
. . .the team would never
have identified. . .

307
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:04,646
. . .the initial errors
in their carbon dating. . .

308
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:06,371
. . .analysis. "

309
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,483
Were there any questions
at this point?

310
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:14,209
What's happening to your accent?

311
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:19,765
Come again? What's this nonsense?

312
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:26,286
All right. I'm not English.

313
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:29,723
I'm from Long lsland.

314
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:33,524
I was really nervous,
and the accent. . .

315
00:19:33,732 --> 00:19:35,211
. . .just came out.

316
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:37,091
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:41,725
So if we could just
get back to the lecture.

318
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,530
Were there any questions?

319
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:49,690
About paleontology?

320
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:55,532
I was just trying to make
a good first impression.

321
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:59,765
Obviously, I screwed up. But what
you guys think of me is important. . .

322
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:02,924
. . .because I'm hoping to get
a permanent job here.

323
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:07,165
So if you'd just give me another
chance to make a good impression--

324
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:09,928
Ross! Are you crazy?

325
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:13,164
I am still your wife?
Were you just never gonna tell me?

326
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,562
What the hell is wrong with you?

327
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,803
I could just kill you!

328
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,610
Well, hello, Rachel!

329
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:35,208
You've really done this before?

330
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:38,360
You just take a big, big swing, okay?

331
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,330
Now, don't hold back.

332
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,048
What are you doing?

333
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:49,728
We're just celebrating that Joey
got his health insurance back.

334
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:51,488
Oh, all right.

00:00:03,853 --> 00:00:07,289
I cannot believe that you didn't
tell me we are still married!

2
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:09,165
Look, I was going to tell you.

3
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:11,807
When? After the birth
of our first secret child?

4
00:00:13,493 --> 00:00:16,166
Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married!

5
00:00:16,373 --> 00:00:18,284
-You're kidding?
-Oh, my God!

6
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:25,326
It wasn't my best decision, but I
couldn't face another failed marriage.

7
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,162
At what point did you think
this was a successful marriage?

8
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:35,965
Rach, come on. If you think about it,
it's actually kind of funny.

9
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,283
Maybe it's best not to think about it.

10
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:45,361
This is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.

11
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,123
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.

12
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,684
Another lie. You have a sickness!

13
00:00:57,093 --> 00:01:00,290
For my own peace of mind,
are you married to any more of us?

16
00:01:39,493 --> 00:01:41,085
Someone left their keys.

17
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:43,962
To a Porsche.

18
00:01:44,893 --> 00:01:47,407
-Are these yours?
-Yeah. That's what I drive.

19
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:52,204
I make 4 bucks an hour.
I saved up for 350 years.

20
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:59,725
Did anybody lose their keys?

21
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,571
Put them in the lost and found.

22
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,411
There's a lost and found?

23
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,206
My shoe!

24
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:09,285
You left a shoe here?

25
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:14,009
I didn't realize till I got home.
I wasn't gonna walk back with one shoe.

26
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:18,323
I'll go find that guy's car
and leave a note on the windshield.

27
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:21,809
When he comes back for his keys,
I'll give him your shoe.

28
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:22,809
Great. Thanks.

29
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,807
Oh, good. You guys are here.
Listen.

30
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:32,131
How would you like to spend tomorrow
taking care of three cute puppies?

31
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,449
My, God! What a fun day!
Sounds great!

32
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:36,211
Yeah, all right.

33
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,723
I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.

34
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,009
By the way, they're not
actually puppies.

35
00:02:42,253 --> 00:02:44,767
They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
See you.

36
00:02:46,093 --> 00:02:47,128
What?

37
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:50,286
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice. . .

38
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:53,849
. . .asked me to babysit them.
I'm nervous. I've never done that.

39
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:55,611
Don't worry. We'll do it.

40
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:59,562
I'm gonna pass, because I was
kind of iffy when it was puppies.

41
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:04,243
Come on, Chandler. It'll give us
great practice for when. . .

42
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:06,609
. . .people with babies come to visit.

43
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:12,249
Nice car.

44
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:14,409
It's not mine.

45
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:19,411
-I love your car.
-Yeah. It's mine.

46
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,005
-I bet it's fast.
-Me too. Yeah.

47
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:26,006
And comfortable.

48
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:28,411
-You like leather seats?
-Yeah.

49
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,043
It's got them!

50
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:39,608
So I still have boxes here.

51
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:42,368
I still have boxes at Ross' .

52
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,404
And I have nowhere to live.

53
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:47,002
I could so easily freak out right now.

54
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:52,524
What about me? Denise is leaving town
for a while. I don't have a roommate.

55
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:59,208
Well, maybe I could be
your roommate, Pheebs.

56
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,563
Maybe you could be my roommate!

57
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:05,602
Well, there's an idea!

58
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,047
That would be great!

59
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:11,326
-How long is Denise gone for?
-She said she'd be back December 26th.

60
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:13,125
December 26th.

61
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:14,488
Maybe she's Santa Claus.

62
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:25,123
Oh, look who it is.
My husband, the apple of my eye.

63
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:28,731
Okay, I got us a court date
for tomorrow at 2. . .

64
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:31,163
. . .and I picked up all the forms.

65
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,687
I'll take care of it.

66
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:37,250
Sure, if you say you'll take care
of it, I have no reason to doubt you.

67
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:39,205
Give me those forms.

68
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:43,088
I'm gonna do this my way, and I
don't wanna hear a peep out of you.

69
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:45,602
-Okay, Rach, but--
-You're peeping!

70
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,646
Ross, I just got--

71
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,203
-Why did you do this?
-I told you--

72
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:56,967
I don't wanna hear
"three failed marriages. "

73
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,846
If you'd had two failed marriages,
you'd understand.

74
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:02,123
Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.

75
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:09,691
Oh, I am so mad, Ross! I don't think
I've ever been this angry!

76
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:13,243
What about when I said
we were on a break?

77
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:21,967
Pheebs, how's it going?

78
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:25,131
I'm okay. Are they having fun?
Am I talking too fast?

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,607
No. You sound like me.

80
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,888
It's going great. Look at Chandler
with Little Baby Girl Chandler.

81
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:35,811
Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have
I heard that before? Oh, Coach Rubin.

82
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:45,805
Pheebs, when you're done over there,
we've got a situation over here too.

83
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,646
No. We are all responsible
for our own babies.

84
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:53,050
That's where you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.

85
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,727
We should really be playing
a zone defense.

86
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:57,966
What do you mean?

87
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:02,212
Things'll go smoother if we each have a
zone. Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.

88
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,205
Mon, be in charge of diapering.

89
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:09,645
I'll be in charge of looking at how cute
they are when they put their hands. . . .

90
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,012
Sounds great, but you should be
in charge of wiping.

91
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:16,972
Okay, I'm a rookie.
I should not be in the end zone.

92
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:31,369
This is so great. This is exactly how
we set the plates at the restaurant.

93
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:34,283
Yeah? Well, this is not
what I ordered.

94
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,762
Hey, guys.

95
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:40,769
Hey, babies.

96
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,852
I'm having the best morning.

97
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,482
That Porsche I've got the keys to?
Still there.

98
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:50,003
Shocking, since you
still have the keys.

99
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:54,006
You should see the treatment I get
with that car.

100
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,523
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.

101
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:59,809
One guy advised me
on my equity investments.

102
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,042
What equity investments?

103
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:04,211
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?

104
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:12,404
If people see me just standing there,
they're gonna think I don't own it.

105
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:15,923
So I figure I'll wash it.
Monica, you got a bucket and soap?

106
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:19,205
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and sponges and rags. . .

107
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:23,167
. . .and carnauba wax
and polishing compound.

108
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:25,172
You don't even have a car.

109
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:29,805
I know. Once there was a dirty car in
front of the building, so I washed it.

110
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:33,567
-And?
-And six others.

111
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:34,808
There you are.

112
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,802
Yeah, she tops out at 1 30.

113
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:44,964
That's just in the city.
I get her up to 1 60 upstate.

114
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,403
Really? You got a place upstate?

115
00:07:47,893 --> 00:07:49,167
Sure.

116
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:53,532
-All right. See you later.
-Okay. Take it easy.

117
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,773
Hey. That's my car.

118
00:07:58,373 --> 00:07:59,601
Really?

119
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,811
Just give me five more minutes.

120
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:04,722
What are you doing?

121
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:07,931
I found the keys, and now
I'm just polishing her up.

122
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,526
-But it's my car.
-Yeah, but it's my wax.

123
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:15,607
Listen, I don't come to the city much.

124
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:19,289
I don't know if you're crazy or
if this is some street theater. . .

125
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,803
. . .but could I have my keys?

126
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,011
Sure. Yeah.
I'll save your parking spot.

127
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:26,811
I'm not coming back.

128
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:28,850
-Why not?
-I live upstate.

129
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,892
Yeah, so did l.

130
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,204
I don't know why I was so nervous. . .

131
00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,325
. . .and why Frank and Alice complain.
This is easy.

132
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:41,172
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
that's the same.

133
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,647
Check it out!
When the babies wake up. . .

134
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,611
. . .they can meet Krog!

135
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,288
That thing could put
someone's eye out.

136
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:55,610
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.

137
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:59,051
They could swallow
one of those little parts.

138
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:02,808
Also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.

139
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,412
They won't swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.

140
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,162
When I was a kid, my mom used to throw
me into a pile of broken glass.

141
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,210
-What?
-Glass, sand, whatever.

142
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,647
Look at little Leslie stretching
in her sleep.

143
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,087
Oh, it's so cute.

144
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,171
I wonder when you stop putting
both legs behind your head.

145
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:24,488
I can still do that.

146
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,408
How are you still single?

147
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:34,730
I thought about it, and maybe you're
right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

148
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:38,608
-What made you change your mind?
-I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

149
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,205
How did that happen?

150
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,649
I was trying to prove
that I was right.

151
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,204
And it turns out I was wrong. . .

152
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:48,404
. . .and now it's lodged in my throat.

153
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,532
This whole time we were
concentrating on the babies. . .

154
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,287
. . .and no one was watching Chandler!

155
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,642
You are asking the court
for an annulment?

156
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,606
Yes, Your Honor. Here are
our forms, all filled out.

157
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,883
So based on your petition. . .

158
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:11,653
. . .you are seeking an annulment
on the grounds. . .

159
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,453
. . .that "Mr. Geller
is mentally unstable. "

160
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:20,013
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.

161
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:24,163
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller
is an intravenous drug user. "

162
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:28,490
-What?
-Yes. Heroin and crack.

163
00:10:30,453 --> 00:10:32,762
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

164
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,372
Well, you would know.

165
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:38,648
Now, it also says here that you. . .

166
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:41,612
. . . "Iied about your sexual preference
before marriage. "

167
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:42,763
Oh, come on.

168
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,203
Ross, please. I found the magazines.

169
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:50,409
And, finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage. "

170
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:54,202
Well, that makes sense since
you're gay and addicted to heroin.

171
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:58,122
You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.

172
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:02,048
I'm not addicted to heroin,
I'm not gay, and there is no problem. . .

173
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:04,813
. . .with my ability
to consummate anything.

174
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:08,011
I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now!

175
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,409
That won't be necessary.

176
00:11:11,893 --> 00:11:15,010
And when we were dating,
we consummated like bunnies.

177
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:20,091
If you were involved in a serious
relationship, that creates a problem.

178
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,490
Rest assured, that relationship
ended two years ago.

179
00:11:23,693 --> 00:11:26,651
Strike "consummated like bunnies"
from the record.

180
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:30,645
Is there anything in this record
that is actually true?

181
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:33,845
Well, yes. We got married in Vegas.

182
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,812
And the names, I think.

183
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:41,332
Based on what I've heard, you certainly
don't qualify for an annulment.

184
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,288
If you don't wanna be together,
file for divorce.

185
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:49,011
That's great. You happy? Look what
you did with your funny, funny form.

186
00:11:49,253 --> 00:11:53,451
What? Me? What about you and your
"consummated like bunnies" nonsense?

187
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:54,489
And what--

188
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:59,005
What are you typing that for?
She said we don't get the annulment.

189
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:01,050
Don't type that. What--

190
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,806
Stop typing!

191
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:05,166
Stop typing!

192
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,207
"Stop typing, stop typing! "

193
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:12,010
Okay, do you see what you're
keeping me married to?

194
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:14,451
Get out of my chambers.

195
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,052
Lady, here's the deal.

196
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:20,172
I came here for an annulment, and
I'm not leaving here until I get one!

197
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,604
-Would you like a night in jail?
-Thank you for your time.

198
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:47,964
That Porsche guy took his car back.

199
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:53,692
But you found the keys to his clothes?

200
00:12:55,013 --> 00:12:59,291
No, I just love the way it feels
when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.

201
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:01,848
They'll think you own one
because of the clothes?

202
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:03,611
Of course.

203
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:07,403
Only an idiot would wear this stuff
if he didn't have the car.

204
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,204
That is true.

205
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:16,485
Yeah, but only a genius would
swallow a sonic blaster gun.

206
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:18,445
Oh, I've been there.

207
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,685
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.

208
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:26,243
You know you don't actually have one.

209
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:30,207
What are you doing? I'm in character.
Will you talk to her?

210
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,089
I think it just moved.
It's poking me.

211
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:36,045
We'll go to the emergency room.

212
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:39,609
No, you can't leave me here with them.
We're babysitting.

213
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:42,646
The babies are asleep.
You'll be okay on your own.

214
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,128
You can't leave me with them.
We're a team.

215
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,608
We're playing a zone.
They'll triple-team me!

216
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:52,170
He's got plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.

217
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:56,247
But a doctor won't be able to help him.
And it's just gonna. . .

218
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:59,411
. . .naturally pass through
his system in seven years.

219
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,526
-I think that's gum.
-I'm pretty sure it's gun.

220
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:07,011
This really hurts. Let's go.

221
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,444
But no! A real man wouldn't
just run to the hospital.

222
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:13,608
No! What would Krog do?

223
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,606
Why isn't that valet back
with my Porsche?

224
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,924
Maybe because you've got the keys?

225
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:31,888
-That was totally your fault.
-My fault? You threatened the judge.

226
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:34,891
You ripped the paper out
of the court reporter's machine!

227
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:38,210
That was the only way I could
get him to stop typing!

228
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:40,930
Hi. How are the Gellers?

229
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:47,610
Don't call us that.

230
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:52,212
The judge wouldn't let us get an
annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce!

231
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:55,003
Did a Porsche throw up on you?

232
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:01,411
It's "Porsche-a" !

233
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,213
Me taking care of you
is no problem, huh?

234
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,052
You guys feel safe, right?

235
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:11,211
I'm gonna take that spit bubble
as a "Yeah, I do! "

236
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:15,812
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.
I'll set you up with a clean one.

237
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,042
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up.

238
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,813
Because, let's face it,
we're at Monica's.

239
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:28,845
I broke it. All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.

240
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,209
Okay. Good.

241
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,411
Why are there only two of you?

242
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,052
Where's Leslie?

243
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:39,768
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?

244
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:42,926
Now would be a good time
for your first words.

245
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:46,812
Well, look at you!

246
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:52,241
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh!

247
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:55,123
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.

248
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,805
Well, it'll dry.

249
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:02,133
You sit with your brother
and sister now. . .

250
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:04,011
. . .who aren't there.

251
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:18,723
How do you feel?

252
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:22,448
Let's just say, Krog will be equipped
to destroy the universe again. . .

253
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:24,490
. . .in 1 2 to 1 4 hours.

254
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,851
I totally took care of the babies
all by myself.

255
00:16:29,053 --> 00:16:30,884
I fed them, bathed them
and put them to bed.

256
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:33,607
And protected them from a tornado?

257
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:38,442
Oh, my God!

258
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:41,008
I know. The babies are asleep.

259
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:43,645
Phoebe, what happened here?

260
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:46,691
I did it. I took care
of the babies all by myself.

261
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:50,772
-But my apartment!
-Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.

262
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:53,361
But the mess!

263
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:57,168
Is not as important as the fact
that Phoebe took care of the babies.

264
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:01,007
You're right. I shouldn't freak out.

265
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,370
This is what it'll be like
when we have babies. When's that?

266
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,411
Phoebe, look at this mess!

267
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,490
Honey, thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.

268
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,203
I picked up the divorce papers.

269
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:29,444
I've already signed everything.
I put little X's where you need to sign.

270
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:32,247
Little X's. Great!
That makes up for everything.

271
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,805
You know, you've done
a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?

272
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:40,726
Name one stupid thing that is
as stupid as this one.

273
00:17:40,933 --> 00:17:43,401
How about you flew to London
to stop my wedding?

274
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:46,207
You told me you loved me
after I was married.

275
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:50,890
Wait, that was different. I did those
things because I was in love with you.

276
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,412
Right.

277
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:58,651
You're right. That's very different.

278
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:01,088
So let's just sign the papers.

279
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:04,648
What?

280
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:06,002
Nothing.

281
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,288
Okay, can we just sign, please?

282
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:22,645
Congratulations.

283
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,809
Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute.

284
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:29,007
I kind of have a little confession.

285
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,532
What?

286
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,201
Well, you know,
this whole marriage thing.

287
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,251
Kind of my idea.

288
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:37,851
Excuse me?

289
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:42,410
Remember how we were too drunk to
remember anything when we were married?

290
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:49,008
I didn't really wanna say anything,
but it just kept coming back to me.

291
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:54,164
We were in the casino, and you thought
it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.

292
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:59,604
And I thought it would be funnier
if we got married.

293
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:04,091
So, as a compromise, we decided
first to get married and then. . .

294
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,603
. . .to eat a lot of grapes.

295
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,730
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.

296
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:17,728
So then if you think about it. . .

297
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:20,726
. . .this is all your fault.

298
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,211
Yeah, don't push it, though.

299
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:28,612
I gotta say. . .

300
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,602
. . .I know I divorce a lot of women.

301
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:37,487
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.

302
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,207
I know.

303
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:43,202
I always thought if we got married,
that'd be the one that stuck.

304
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,208
And it wouldn't be a secret. . .

305
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:49,810
. . .and we wouldn't have our
wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.

306
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,611
Did I even treat?

307
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:57,402
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.

308
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:00,687
That may be the most depressing thing
I've heard.

309
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:06,202
I should get these
to my lawyer's office.

310
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:09,249
Thanks for taking care of all this.

311
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:10,568
No problem.

312
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:23,762
-I'm gonna need a copy of those.
-Totally.

313
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:34,013
Careful around my Porsche!

314
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:36,808
Hi, Joey.

315
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:39,613
Hey. How you doing?

316
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,687
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

317
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,851
I'd show you, but I just tucked
her in. She's sleeping.

318
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:49,444
Would you like to go for a drink?

00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:11,761
I'm moving out, so you're
in charge of paying the rent.

2
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,091
-When's it due?
-On the first.

3
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:15,685
And that's every month?

4
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,488
No, just the months
you want to live here.

5
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:21,929
Okay, here's the phone bill.

6
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:24,571
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:27,524
That's our phone number.

8
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:32,004
I know I kind of sprung this
me-moving-out-on-you thing.

9
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:35,642
-Why don't I cover you for a while?
-No way!

10
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,929
Joey Tribbiani does not
take charity. . .

11
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:40,761
. . .anymore.

12
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,364
-It's not charity, Joe.
-Forget it.

13
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,762
Thanks, but I'm done
taking money from you.

14
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,930
I can take care of myself.
What's next? Come on.

15
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:51,571
Here's the electric bill.

16
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:55,202
-This is how much we pay for electric?
-Well, yeah.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,611
So we'll do
the rest of the bills later, then?

20
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,962
Will Joey have to give up
the apartment?

21
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,362
I offered him money,
but he wouldn't take it.

22
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:45,965
How much does he need?

23
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,561
$1 500 would cover him
for a few months. . .

24
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:52,367
. . .but I have to trick him into
taking it so I don't hurt his pride.

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,568
Why don't you hire him as an actor?

26
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:59,645
You could have him dress up
and put on skits whenever you want.

27
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:03,966
Well, that would help the pride thing.

28
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:10,121
Wow, you look great! Do you wanna
move in with me tomorrow?

29
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:14,811
Any plans for tonight?

30
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,407
Instead of being sad on my
last night with Rachel. . .

31
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:21,440
. . .we're going out to celebrate
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

32
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:24,729
-And also my birthday.
-It's not your birthday.

33
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:30,008
What a mean thing to say! I'd never
tell you it wasn't your birthday.

34
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,650
You guys have anything planned
for the big last night?

35
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:39,441
Instead of just hanging out,
we figure we'd do nothing.

36
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,370
Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought you'd come and watch it.

37
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:46,886
I don't know, Ross.

38
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:50,841
Not if you talk about how you gave up
basketball to become a paleontologist.

39
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:55,449
I did give up a career in basketball
to become a paleontologist!

40
00:02:56,212 --> 00:02:58,282
-Pheebs--
-You're not dressed yet?

41
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,171
We're supposed to start having fun
in 1 5 minutes!

42
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:05,010
And clearly, not a minute sooner.

43
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:09,207
You are packed, though, right?
Please tell me you're packed?

44
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:12,489
Of course I'm packed.
Monica, relax.

45
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,007
I wanted to ask Phoebe
what I should wear.

46
00:03:15,252 --> 00:03:17,686
My God, I can't get a minute of peace.

47
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:23,089
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:27,207
Monica's just gonna kill you.

49
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:28,521
I know.

50
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:30,763
What you're wearing is fine
for that.

51
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,485
You're not packed!

52
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,367
You're not packed even a little bit!

53
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,680
Surprise!

54
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:45,808
Don't get mad,
because this is what happened.

55
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:49,362
I started packing,
then I realized, "What am I doing?"

56
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:52,211
I am lousy at packing, right?

57
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,091
But you love packing!

58
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:58,086
So as a gift to you
on our last night. . . .

59
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:04,410
I'll be coordinator!

60
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:07,883
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

61
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,766
Everybody has to help.
Phoebe, can you help?

62
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,240
I have plans.

63
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:15,047
-You have plans with us.
-That's right.

64
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:19,285
Chandler can make boxes, Ross can
wrap, and Joey can lift.

65
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:21,568
Tell the guys
they have to help out.

66
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:23,484
My God, thank you!

67
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,201
Monica's gonna make you pack!
She's got jobs for everyone!

68
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:30,649
Now, it's too late for me,
but save yourselves!

69
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:35,964
The movers will be here in 1 1 hours.
Rachel hasn't packed.

70
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:38,089
Now, everybody has to help.
Chandler--

71
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,129
I have plans with Joey.

72
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:44,805
-You said you were doing nothing.
-Yes, but for the last time.

73
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,805
Fine. Now, Ross--

74
00:04:48,052 --> 00:04:50,282
-I can't do it.
-Why not?

75
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:53,888
-Don't you have Ben?
-Because I have Ben!

76
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:57,360
It's almost past his bedtime.
Where is he?

77
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:58,925
He's at a dinner party.

78
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:03,852
He's really coming?
I can see in your apartment.

79
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:06,162
Of course he is. What?

80
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,880
You think I'd use my son as an excuse?

81
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:11,322
What kind of father do you think I am?

82
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,047
All right. Sorry.

83
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:16,123
I gotta go make a fake Ben.

84
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,482
Here it is.

85
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:24,166
Our last pizzas together as roommates.

86
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:26,681
I wish I knew that.
I ordered Chinese.

87
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,490
Well, that's okay.

88
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:31,007
In a way it's kind of nice.
You know?

89
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:35,040
Our last dinner together. Me,
bringing the food of my ancestors. . .

90
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,362
. . .you, the food of yours!

91
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:44,446
I had an idea for what to do
on our last night.

92
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,490
What do you say we play a little
foosball for money?

93
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:51,566
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me
since my injury-plagued '97 season.

94
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:55,327
-It'd be easier to give me your money.
-Yes, it would.

95
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:58,325
What do you say to $50?

96
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:00,563
-You're on.
-Okay, let's play.

97
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,603
The big game. Italy versus. . .

98
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:04,285
. . .China, apparently.

99
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:10,288
Look, it's the Rollerblades.

100
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,965
Oh, God!

101
00:06:12,492 --> 00:06:15,165
You remember when we got these?

102
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,685
I guess you weren't there.

103
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:24,091
You guys,
we said we were gonna have fun.

104
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:27,005
Come on. Hey, remember the time. . . .

105
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,491
You don't remember?

106
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:37,808
Sorry, Pheebs. I'm just really sad
that I'm leaving.

107
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:39,804
I'm gonna miss you so much.

108
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:43,169
This doesn't have to be so sad,
though, you know?

109
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:46,364
Instead of thinking about
how you'll miss each other. . .

110
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,167
. . .you should think of the things
you're not gonna miss.

111
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:52,764
I don't think there's anything.

112
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:55,122
Come on, there's gotta be something.

113
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:58,130
She's perfect.

114
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:02,446
I have one.

115
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:05,885
Okay, you can go first.

116
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,282
I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact. . .

117
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:12,411
. . .that you're never allowed
to move the phone pen.

118
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:18,366
That's a good one.
Okay, Monica, anything?

119
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,762
You know,
does Rachel move the phone pen?

120
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,451
Sometimes.

121
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,971
Always, actually.

122
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,007
There you go.
Doesn't everyone feel better?

123
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:33,369
Not just the phone pen.

124
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,530
I never get my messages.

125
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:38,285
You get your messages.

126
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:41,569
It doesn't count if you have to
read them off your hand. . .

127
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:44,491
. . .after you've fallen asleep
on the couch.

128
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,200
So you missed a message from who?
Chandler?

129
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:48,805
Or your mom?

130
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:50,885
Or Chandler?

131
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,207
Or your mom?

132
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:57,810
It worked! No one's sad!

133
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:02,768
I win again!

134
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:05,810
That's, like, 500 bucks
you owe me!

135
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,282
Man! Five hundred dollars.

136
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:11,649
That is a lot of electricity, huh?

137
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,210
I gotta buy some food.

138
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:17,805
Give me a chance to win my money back.
Sudden death. . .

139
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,646
. . .one goal, $1 000.

140
00:08:21,212 --> 00:08:22,645
-You serious?
-Yes!

141
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:26,044
Get ready to owe me.

142
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,566
Here we go. Ready?

143
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:54,048
No. . .

144
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:55,526
. . .one can beat me!

145
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,647
That's why only the little fake men
are supposed to do the kicking.

146
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:12,365
Hi, Ross.
See, other people call me!

147
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:15,172
Your brother. Score!

148
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:17,886
What's up?

149
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:19,281
I'm here with Ben.

150
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:21,045
Thought we'd say hi.

151
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:22,088
Put him on.

152
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,687
Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.

153
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:29,962
I guess he doesn't feel like
talking right now.

154
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:32,527
He's smiling, though.

155
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,561
Okay, talk to you later.

156
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,606
I think it was better
when you guys were sad.

157
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,167
Hey, remember the Rollerblades?

158
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,241
You know what else I won't miss?
"I'm Monica.

159
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,768
I wash the toilets 1 7 times a day,
even if people are on it! "

160
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,566
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
Is my sweater too tight?

161
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:02,121
I'd better wash it and shrink it! "

162
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:06,362
"I'm Monica. I never get messages
from interesting people. "

163
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,448
I call her.

164
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:14,087
"Oh, my God! I love Ross. I hate
Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross! "

165
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,050
"My God!
I can't find a boyfriend.

166
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:21,285
I'll stumble across the hall and sleep
with the first guy I find there! "

167
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:30,765
We should get a move on if we want
to make those dinner reservations.

168
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,685
Still broken?

169
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,845
It sucks, man.

170
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:44,765
Your last night, and I lose the two
most important things:

171
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,042
The foosball table. . .

172
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,010
. . .and $500.

173
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:53,767
There are other ways to win back
your money. How about blackjack?

174
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:55,240
Not my game.

175
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,926
You know what?
We can play a new game.

176
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,367
-It's fun!
-What's it called?

177
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:03,125
Cups.

178
00:11:04,612 --> 00:11:07,922
-I don't know how.
-I'll teach you. It's easy and fun.

179
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,929
-All right.
-Here you go.

180
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,243
I have two queens.
What do you have?

181
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,882
-A 2 and a 5.
-You win! Fifty dollars!

182
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:20,410
-Really?
-Let's play again.

183
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:26,202
-What have you got?
-4 and a 9.

184
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,245
You're kidding, right?

185
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:31,761
-No. Why?
-That's a full cup!

186
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,768
Damn, I am good at Cups!

187
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:39,571
I'm not talking to her.

188
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,201
You have to take the first step. . .

189
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,762
. . .because she's the one who's
leaving. It's harder for her.

190
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:48,207
Maybe you're right.

191
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,761
But she made fun of my phone pen!

192
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:53,608
I know. I took it hard too.

193
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:59,442
I feel bad about what happened--

194
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:02,047
-What are you doing?
-I'm unpacking.

195
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,972
I'm not moving.
Is that picture straight?

196
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:08,885
It needs to go about 20 blocks
to the left.

197
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,920
You're the one who wants this
big change and move in with Chandler!

198
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:15,083
You should go!
Why do I have to leave?

199
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:18,881
-It's my apartment!
-It's mine too! What else you got?

200
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,650
How about: You're moving!

201
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,331
This is ridiculous.

202
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,884
We should be packing you!

203
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:41,564
-Hey, how you guys doing?
-Great. Monica's moving.

204
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,047
I am not!

205
00:12:44,292 --> 00:12:47,170
Really? How come all your
stuff is in this box?

206
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:50,848
Okay, you guys,
I think I know what's going on here!

207
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,203
You guys? Stop!

208
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:58,363
I know you're acting mad because
it'll make it easier to leave.

209
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,564
But deep down, you're really sad.
Deep, deep down.

210
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:03,842
-No, Phoebe, I am mad!
-Well, deep down!

211
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:05,241
I'm just mad.

212
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:07,281
Then keep running.

213
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:11,602
You win!

214
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:13,808
-What did you have?
-Nothing beats. . .

215
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:16,203
. . .a three and a six.

216
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,968
That, my friend, is "D Cup. "

217
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:23,327
How much have you won so far?

218
00:13:24,732 --> 00:13:26,848
-700.
-Not 700 exactly?

219
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,362
Double it.

220
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:34,647
In Cups, once you get $700,
you have to double it.

221
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,209
I didn't make up the rules.

222
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:44,006
Now, after you receive the doubling
bonus, you get one card.

223
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:48,689
That one card could be worth $1 00,
which brings your total to $1 500.

224
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:54,364
Don't get excited, that won't happen
unless you get the-- No way!

225
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:59,368
This is the last box of your clothes.

226
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,405
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

227
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:07,248
I was just gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

228
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:12,451
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but. . .

229
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,922
. . .I don't wanna live with
Rachel anymore.

230
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,569
You're so mean to each other.

231
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:20,889
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

232
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,206
That's fine because I'm not moving.

233
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:27,164
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

234
00:14:27,892 --> 00:14:29,450
I said some bad stuff. . .

235
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:32,650
. . .but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.

236
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:34,245
Like what, Monica?

237
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,567
She has 1 47,000 pair of boots?

238
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,370
Good start, Mon.

239
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,010
She lets you borrow them.

240
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:47,205
And you stretch them out
with your big old clown feet.

241
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,411
Do you wanna live outside?
Because it's getting cold!

242
00:14:53,212 --> 00:14:57,888
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
down the pages of things I'd like.

243
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,281
What else?

244
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,610
When I take a shower. . .

245
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:05,008
. . .she leaves me notes on the mirror.

246
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,368
I do. I do do that.

247
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:11,407
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

248
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,967
When I fall asleep on the couch. . .

249
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:19,004
. . .she covers me with a blanket.

250
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:22,927
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

251
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:29,767
And when I told her I was gonna
move in with Chandler. . .

252
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,730
. . .she was really supportive.

253
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:36,004
You were so great.

254
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:39,527
You made it so easy.

255
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,482
And now you have to leave.

256
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,321
And I have to live with a boy!

257
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,208
It's gonna be fine.

258
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,646
Now I can't wait to live with you!

259
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:56,561
You know what we should do?

260
00:15:56,812 --> 00:16:00,600
Bring Monica, and we'll live together!
We'll have so much fun!

261
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,288
I think she's moving in with Chandler.

262
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:07,524
Oh, that's right.
You're still set on that?

263
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,565
Kinda.

264
00:16:16,372 --> 00:16:17,521
Oh, my God!

265
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,683
How's the packing going?

266
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:28,602
Ben? He's fine. He's right--
Oh, my God!

267
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,169
Get your head out of your shirt
there, son!

268
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:37,930
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.

269
00:16:42,212 --> 00:16:44,567
-What's wrong?
-Ross and I were helping pack. . .

270
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:48,481
. . .took a little break.
I lost $1 500 to him in Cups!

271
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,648
How did you lose at Cups?

272
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:54,446
The same way you lost!

273
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:58,970
I started out with the king and the
queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.

274
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:02,769
Then I get a jack and a king.
Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.

275
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:06,005
Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
the D Cup. . .

276
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:11,167
. . .the sitting-down bonus. I didn't
even get half a cup! Nothing!

277
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:13,041
Oh, man!

278
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:15,723
He never played before either.

279
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:19,123
I think beginner's luck
is very important in Cups!

280
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,442
Let's play one more hand.
One more hand.

281
00:17:22,692 --> 00:17:26,048
No more! I cannot lose another dime.
I'm serious this time.

282
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:27,691
In fact, look.

283
00:17:27,932 --> 00:17:29,650
I wanna give you something.

284
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,531
Let me give it to you before
I pawn it for Cups money.

285
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,164
I want you to have
the big, white dog. . .

286
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:43,007
. . .as a thank-you for being
such a great roommate.

287
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,409
I can't take the big, white dog.
You love it.

288
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:49,007
It's "him. " Not "it. "

289
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:52,360
What if I bought it from you?

290
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,689
Then your nice gesture would be
giving it to me at a reasonable price.

291
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:57,524
Say $1 500?

292
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:02,688
Wait a second.
I see what you're trying to do here.

293
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:05,162
You're trying to give me money again!

294
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:07,203
When did I try to give you money?

295
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,170
Over there with the bills!

296
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:12,250
You tried to give me charity,
I said no, you dropped it.

297
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,244
We had a nice last night together.

298
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:17,882
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
tried to give anybody any money.

299
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,651
Now you start with the
charity thing again!

300
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:26,487
I'm trying to help you out.
I wanna make sure that you're okay.

301
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,688
I will be okay.

302
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:32,686
You gotta get it out of your head
that I can't take care of myself.

303
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:36,890
I'm not gonna miss you helping me
out with money.

304
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:39,327
The only thing I'm gonna miss. . .

305
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,251
. . .is you.

306
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:45,291
And now the dog.

307
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,168
-Call me when you get there, okay?
-Okay.

308
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,004
I'm really gonna miss you.

309
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:06,724
I have your key.

310
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,688
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

311
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:19,126
God, this is silly.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

312
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:22,006
Bye, house.

313
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:55,480
-She really left.
-I know.

314
00:19:58,252 --> 00:20:01,210
-Thank you.
-No problem, roomie.

315
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,281
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

316
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:14,126
What the hell is that dog doing here?

317
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:22,003
I invented the game of Cups
as a way to give Joey money.

318
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:25,562
-And now you want that money back?
-Exactly.

319
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:28,007
What kind of idiot do you
take me for?

320
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:31,203
It's not a real game.
I made it up.

321
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:34,410
I'm sorry you lost your money.
But I won it fair and square.

322
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:35,971
At a fake game!

323
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,492
If you wanna try to
make some of it back. . .

324
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:42,769
. . .I'd be glad to play you for it.
But I should warn you.

325
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:46,044
I am very good at Cups.

326
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:50,684
I assume the saucer card
came up when you played last?

327
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:55,366
Let's see if it comes up this time.

Hi, it's Rachel and Phoebe's.
Please. . .

-Leave.

00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:12,246
But I just said "Ieave. "

5
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:15,245
I know because you have
all the good words.

6
00:00:15,612 --> 00:00:19,969
What do I get? I get "it's," "and. "
Oh, I'm sorry, I have "a. " Forget it.

7
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:23,126
-That's silly.
-All right. So let's switch.

8
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:25,442
No, I have all the good words.

9
00:00:25,932 --> 00:00:27,923
Okay, fine, fine.
We can switch.

10
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:31,886

00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,448
Wait. How did you do that?

14
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,045
What?

15
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:41,611
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
are you?

16
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:46,167
Can we finish this later?
I'm going running before it gets dark.

17
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,762
-Why don't you come with me?
-Really?

18
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:53,528
It'll be fun! We'll run in the park.
It'll be our roommate-bonding thing.

19
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,131
Okay, let's go running!

20
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:57,681
-There's cute guys there.
-Let's run towards them!

21
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:01,170
Wait just one more second.

22
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:04,051
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's.
Please leave a message. Thanks!

23
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:07,007
Wait a minute.
You took all the words!

24
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:09,726
You've met your match, Rachel Greene!

27
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,965
I just finished this
fascinating book.

28
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,249
By the year 2030,
there'll be computers. . .

29
00:01:55,452 --> 00:02:00,287
. . .that can carry out the same amount
of functions as a human brain.

30
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,523
So, theoretically,
you could download. . .

31
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:06,048
. . .your thoughts and memories
into this computer. . .

32
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,285
. . .and live forever as a machine.

33
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:18,007
And I just realized I can sleep
with my eyes open.

34
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:25,561
Honey, it was a great idea,
nailing the boxes to the floor.

35
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:30,849
-I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
-So you can move them!

36
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,881
And while I'm doing that, Ross has
a great computer story for you.

37
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,881
Hey, everybody!
I'd like you to meet Janine.

38
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:43,009
She's gonna be my new roommate!

39
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:49,083
And she's gonna live with me!

40
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:52,684
It's nice to meet you. Janine. . .?

41
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:54,081
Le Croix.

42
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:56,971
I didn't know that.
What a pretty last name.

43
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,731
So where are you from?

44
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,849
Australia.
I just moved here.

45
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:03,451
From the land down under?

46
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:05,643
I didn't know that either!

47
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,371
So what do you do?

48
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:11,285
-I'm a dancer.
-You're a dancer?

49
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:13,409
She's a dancer!

50
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:17,847
I think I'll go unpack.

51
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,246
Did you interview her
before you asked her to move in?

52
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,368
Of course!

53
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,565
What did you ask her?

54
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:36,450
When can you move in?

55
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,685
Thank you for bringing her
into our lives.

56
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:44,488
Unbelievable.

57
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,651
You like her too?

58
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,570
Look at all the boxes!

59
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:52,482
I cannot wait to ask her out.

60
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,883
Wait a minute.
You can't. She's your roommate.

61
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:57,451
It'll be too complicated.

62
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,091
Yeah, don't do it.

63
00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:02,483
I mean, if you date her,
then I can't date her.

64
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:06,842
Think about it. Remember
when you broke up with Donna. . .

65
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:10,243
. . .how horrible it was when you
bumped into her at the supermarket?

66
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:11,845
Oh, God, yeah.

67
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:14,560
Now imagine you live
at the supermarket.

68
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:15,927
Okay!

69
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:22,163
You're right! I don't want that.
I can't date her.

70
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:26,291
You'd better watch the flirting too,
because it could be trouble.

71
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,250
Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.

72
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:31,723
It's hard for me to be around
an attractive woman and not flirt.

73
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,644
You're around me all the time,
and you don't flirt.

74
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,801
A little sad about that, sweetie?

75
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:47,249
I have to tie my shoes, so you
go ahead. I'll catch up.

76
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:54,929
Come on, that's not running!
Let's go!

77
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:02,642
I'm telling you, when she runs. . .

78
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:04,883
. . .she looks like Kermit the Frog. . .

79
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:07,043
. . .and the Six Million Dollar Man.

80
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,602
Monica had such a crush on him.

81
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:16,130
She used to kiss his poster
every night before she went to bed.

82
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:17,487
I used to do that too!

83
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:20,929
Did you also have his album,
"It's Not Easy Being Green"?

84
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:24,529
Oh, Mon.

85
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:28,324
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?

86
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:31,492
Yeah. And I know she'll
want to run again.

87
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,485
I don't know how to get out of it.
I mean, I live with her.

88
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,690
Why don't you be straight with her?
Tell her the truth.

89
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:41,242
You're right.
I should just tell her the truth.

90
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:46,445
Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don't
think I can ever run again, ever!

91
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,002
Why? Why would you do that?

92
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:51,362
I don't know.

93
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:55,082
Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles.

94
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:56,248
Ankle.

95
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:57,680
We'll see.

96
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:04,288
Okay. I am officially unpacked.

97
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,170
Thanks for helping me, man.

98
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:08,007
Joe?

99
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,482
Well, I guess Joey went home.

100
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:20,961
And look, there is still one box
I have to unpack.

101
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,520
I got you!

102
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,042
Oh, my God. . .

103
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:30,288
. . .you almost gave me
a heart attack.

104
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:33,401
It was so hard not to laugh.

105
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,248
Hey, the place looks great.

106
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:37,561
Not bad, right?

107
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:41,441
Monica's working late,
so I'm gonna make this place spotless.

108
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,280
You know what else I'll do?

109
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:46,285
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get her some flowers.

110
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,284
Who wouldn't want to live with me?

111
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:49,801
I don't.

112
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:54,041
No, I want to live with
the super-hot Australian dancer!

113
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:57,090
How's that going? Are you okay
with the not-flirting thing?

114
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,084
So far. But it's tough.

115
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:03,245
I've got this built-up flirting energy,
and I don't know how to get rid of it.

116
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,809
How you doing?

117
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,050
Oh, man!

118
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,682
Sorry. There's just
more room out here.

119
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:22,847
No, you just reminded me
that I have to do my stretches too.

120
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,371
Why don't you try to be. . .?

121
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:32,965
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

122
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:34,884
I didn't want you to touch me. . .

123
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:38,090
. . .because I'm all sweaty
from the workout.

124
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:39,891
I'm gonna hit the shower.

125
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,411
Oh, my God!

126
00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:46,483
Sorry about that stuff
hanging in there.

127
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,451
It's just my thongs are
too delicate for the dryer.

128
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:03,531
Oh, yeah, it's me.

129
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,730
I saw you grab your running shoes
this morning and sneak out.

130
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,088
You lied so you could run by yourself.

131
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:11,288
No, Phoebe, no. I was. . . .

132
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,090
I was actually just checking. . .

133
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:14,367
. . .to see. . .

134
00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,250
. . .if I could run. And I can!

135
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:17,891
Please, I'm not an idiot.

136
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,360
No, wait. Phoebe?

137
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:34,365
Wow. Couples who live together
do start to look alike.

138
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:37,929
So, Mondler. . . .

139
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,246
What are you doing?

140
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,562
What does it look like?
I am cleaning.

141
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,963
Did you get Monica's authorization
to move all her stuff?

142
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:51,647
I don't need that.
I'll put everything back.

143
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,042
Put it back exactly
where you found it?

144
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:57,324
Yes. I'm gonna put it back
exactly where I found it.

145
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,041
First of all,
that attitude is not helping.

146
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,443
She won't care if I put her stuff
back in the same stupid place.

147
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:07,042
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

148
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:10,885
She'll recognize
that I did a nice thing. . .

149
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:12,724
. . .and appreciate it.

150
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,328
Actually, this will work out well.

151
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,363
Because when you move back
with Joey. . .

152
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:20,445
. . .Joey's hot new roommate
can come live with me.

153
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,441
Oh, I see. You're trying
to freak me out.

154
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:28,129
Chandler, Monica is really weird
about this kind of stuff, all right?

155
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:32,843
Believe me, I lived with her for
1 6 years. She's going to freak out.

156
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,441
Oh, my God.
She's going to sit on you.

157
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,568
No, she is not.
I'll prove it to you.

158
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,450
I'll call her right now.

159
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,051
Phone's done.

160
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,049
-Hey, Mon. How's it going?
-Terrible.

161
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,442
If I want something done right,
I have to do it myself.

162
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,284
Other people just wreck stuff.

163
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,247
I think I might kill someone tonight.

164
00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:00,647
Come on, it can't be that bad.

165
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,484
The only thing getting me through. . .

166
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,529
. . .is knowing I'll see you soon.

167
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,889
I might even try
to get out of here early.

168
00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:09,850
It sounds like they need you there.

169
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,482
-You're just hanging out with Ross?
-It's all good! Okay, bye!

170
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,645
She's gonna kill me.

171
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:19,487
The phone was facing the other way.

172
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,522
And that goes back up there.

173
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,483
We should start with the big stuff.

174
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:32,042
That'll be the easiest.
Let's start with the couch.

175
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,567
I got it.

176
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:40,129
That doesn't look right.

177
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:43,364
What are you talking about?
The couch is in line with the carpet.

178
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:47,730
Then I can just walk over here
and casually put my feet up on. . . .

179
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,570
Okay, here's what we do.

180
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:53,087
We move the couch
closer to the coffee table.

181
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:56,165
But then the back of the couch
won't line up with the carpet.

182
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,370
Well, we'll just move
the coffee table. . .

183
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:00,567
. . .closer to the couch.

184
00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:05,727
But then the coffee table
won't be centered in the seating area.

185
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,330
But the coffee table doesn't
match the table!

186
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,650
Look, what am I gonna do?

187
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:19,204
I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing
her to me like a moth to a flame!

188
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,647
What the hell's going on over here?

189
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,531
Monica's gonna kill you!

190
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:32,287
I need your help.

191
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:35,968
I have to do something
to repel this woman.

192
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:37,964
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

193
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,930
You guys repel women all the time!

194
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,960
Hey, I've been married three times.

195
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:50,847
No, I've seen it happen.

196
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:54,721
You get a rapport going with a woman,
but somehow you manage to kill it.

197
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,206
What's your secret?

198
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,848
We do not repel women, okay?

199
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,690
That is completely untrue.

200
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,366
Oh, yes, we do, my man.

201
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,247
Remember when we went to a dance. . .

202
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:11,450
. . .and you walked up to that girl
you liked and talked. . .

203
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,047
. . .about the lrish potato famine?

204
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,765
What about you?
You weren't so hot either.

205
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,207
After everything he said,
he'd go--

206
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:25,929
Monica doesn't like that either.
I should stop doing that.

207
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:29,644
Girls don't like it when
I start talking about science.

208
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,962
That's not specific to girls.

209
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,681
This is great. What else?

210
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,650
They don't like you correcting
their grammar.

211
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:41,168
And they don't like it when you
explain why your jokes are funny.

212
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:46,207
They don't like it when you
keep asking them if they like you.

213
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,801
-Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
-I'm never gonna find love again.

214
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:58,360
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

215
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,964
Phoebe, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, okay?

216
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:09,248
I handled the situation horribly.

217
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,767
And I should not have lied to you.

218
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,569
So what should you have done?

219
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,968
I should have told you the truth.

220
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,331
Which is?

221
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:24,568
Well, the reason I didn't
want to go running with you is. . .

222
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,247
. . .because. . .

223
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:29,649
. . .the way that you run
is just a little. . . .

224
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:33,491
-So?
-It's embarrassing.

225
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,848
People were looking at us
like we were crazy.

226
00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:38,771
-Why do you care?
-Because they're people!

227
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:41,892
People you don't know
and will never see again.

228
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:44,168
Yes, but still they are people. . .

229
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,640
. . .with eyes.

230
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,289
I didn't get embarrassed
running next to Miss. . . .

231
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,360
But okay.

232
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:58,651
I can see why running with me
would be embarrassing to you.

233
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,444
Okay. You're uptight.

234
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,291
What? I am not uptight.

235
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:08,971
I am not uptight, man.

236
00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:13,929
That's okay. I'm not judging you.
That's just who you are.

237
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:17,443
I'm more free, you know.
I run like I did when I was a kid. . .

238
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,286
. . .because that's the only way
it's fun, you know?

239
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:23,842
Didn't you ever run so fast
you thought your legs would fall off. . .

240
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:28,728
. . .Iike when you were running towards
the swings or running away from Satan?

241
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,281
The neighbor's dog.

242
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,525
Is this in the right place?

243
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,848
Who cares? I repel women.

244
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,486
You can't come in here!

245
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:48,324
Ross is naked!

246
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:56,849
I couldn't say I was naked,
because she's allowed to see me naked.

247
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:59,282
Why does anyone have to be naked?

248
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,443
Why is Ross naked?

249
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:09,481
I had to show Chandler something.

250
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,088
Naked?

251
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,843
I guess I have. . .

252
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,170
. . .a "guy" problem.

253
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,446
Is it the same thing
Chandler had?

254
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:31,691
We'll get everything squared away,
and you can come back later!

255
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:35,805
There's still some of Chandler's
medicine in the bathroom.

256
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,645
-Bye.
-Bye!

257
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:45,601
Thank God.

258
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:50,804
Dude, what'd you have?

259
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:55,131
We have no time, okay?
We must focus.

260
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,045
We've got to get everything
back into its original place.

261
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,162
The photo album!

262
00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:03,087
There were millions of pictures
of the apartment in the photo album.

263
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:05,766
We just match everything
to the pictures!

264
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,207
That's perfect! That's brilliant!

265
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,121
What'd you have?

266
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,323
I've got some beer for you.

267
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:21,524
Don't you mean "for whom"?

268
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,481
Sure.

269
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:28,245
I was gonna order some pizza.
You wanna share one?

270
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:31,649
Pizza? It's not like I never
had that before.

271
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,006
Is something wrong?

272
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,084
All right, all right.

273
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,085
Let's just get this
out in the open, okay?

274
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,208
You're hot.

275
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:45,762
I'm lovable.

276
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:50,282
Clearly, there's a vibe
going on between us.

277
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:51,647
But we're roommates. . .

278
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:55,362
. . .and it's a huge mistake
for us to continue down this road.

279
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:59,041
Imagine living in a supermarket. . .

280
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,605
. . .and you'll understand.

281
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:06,247
Okay? So the question is,
what do we do?

282
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,044
There isn't anything to do.

283
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,681
I think you're really sweet.

284
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:13,326
But I'm not interested
in you like that.

285
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:21,087
No, I mean. . . .

286
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:26,762
You're a nice guy, and I'm happy
to be your roommate and your friend.

287
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,889
I'm just, you know, I just. . .

288
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,204
. . .don't feel that way about you.

289
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:36,766
I see what happened.

290
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:39,926
It's because I was trying
to repel you.

291
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:44,842
Right? Believe me, you'd feel
a lot different if I turned it on.

292
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,127
-I don't think so.
-Oh, I do.

293
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,923
How you doing?

294
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:55,728
I'm okay.

295
00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:57,808
What?

296
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:00,287
What?

297
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,009
Oh, dear God!

298
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,246
I'm so sorry. You're right.
This feels great!

299
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:30,246
And you don't care if people stare.
It's only a second. Then you're gone!

300
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:34,642
It's amazing!
I feel so free and so graceful!

301
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,251
Watch out for the horse.

302
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,085
Can I come in now?

303
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:59,922
-Why is everything different?
-Bye.

304
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,251
I don't see anything different. . .

305
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:08,968
. . .other than the fact that the room
got brighter when you came into it.

306
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,245
The end table is wrong,
the couch looks bizarre. . .

307
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:15,643
. . .and don't even get me started
on the refrigerator magnets.

308
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,051
Okay, don't be mad, okay?

309
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:23,245
After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted
to do something nice for you. . .

310
00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:26,245
. . .so I cleaned the apartment.

311
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,888
So I moved everything around,
and then I forgot. . .

312
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,249
. . .where it went back.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.

313
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:36,450
That's okay.

314
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,162
Are you afraid of me or something?

315
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,843
Do you want me to be afraid of you?

316
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,684
Of course not.

317
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:48,289
My gosh, Chandler, what you did
is a wonderful thing. . .

318
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,250
. . .and I really appreciate it.

319
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,770
I have this thing where I want
everything in the perfect place.

320
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:56,321
But I'd never expect you
to worry about that.

321
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,206
Really?

322
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:00,087
Of course.

323
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:02,491
Oh, you're the best.

324
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:04,365
You come here to me.

325
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,528
Hold on, okay?
First things first.

326
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:12,050
Did Ross sit anywhere
while he was naked?

327
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,362
It said that by the year 2030. . .

328
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:22,649
. . .there'll be computers carrying
out the same number of functions. . .

329
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:24,848
. . .as an actual human brain.

330
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,289
So, theoretically, you could
download your thoughts. . .

331
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:30,648
. . .and your memories
into this computer--

332
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:33,127
And live forever as a machine.

333
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,764
Janine, do you know
what we're doing right now?

334
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,646
You and l, we're interfacing.

335
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,604
I gotta go.

Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

2
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:11,645
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world. . .

3
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:15,447
. . .for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

4
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:18,129
Sure, neighbor! Come on in!

5
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,487
Is Janine around?

6
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,085
She's at dance class.

7
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:23,526
Can I check my room?

8
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,485
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

9
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:31,645
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:34,525
It's like a guy never lived in here.

11
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:38,847
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

12
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:40,481
It is?

13
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:44,322
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

14
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:49,201
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

15
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:53,729
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

16
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:55,524
This is a "guy's" place.

17
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:58,724
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

18
00:01:00,012 --> 00:01:03,288
-You're right. I'll talk to her.
-Talk to her. Be a man!

19
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:05,244
-I'm a man.
-Defend yourself!

20
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,768
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

21
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,451
Be right there, sweetums.

22
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:14,365
Totally different situation.

25
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:55,448
Hey, guys.

26
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:57,643
-How was breakfast with Hillary?
-Okay.

27
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,367
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

28
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:04,848
Is this Hillary, your
hot assistant chef, Hillary?

29
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:08,241
The one that stares at me
when I come in?

30
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:12,241
The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

31
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,526
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

32
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:18,880
Why don't you set us up?

33
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:22,846
Are you setting Ross up with someone?
Does she have a wedding dress?

34
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:27,408
Rachel?

35
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:31,321
I'm making up flyers to try
to get new massage clients.

36
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:34,046
Can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copier?

37
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:38,450
Sure, but they might think it's weird
since I don't work there anymore.

38
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:41,288
Oh, my God! What happened?

39
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,329
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

40
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:45,882
Well, that's great! Congratulations!

41
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,684
A year ago.

42
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,168
You've lasted all year! Good for you.

43
00:02:56,012 --> 00:02:59,209
You could still use the copier
where I actually work.

44
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,051
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

45
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:04,408
Kim will freak out.
She doesn't like me.

46
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:07,843
-I don't think my boss likes me.
-I don't think mine likes me.

47
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:10,807
Maybe it's a universal thing.

48
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:14,561
Maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 1 1 :30 on a Wednesday.

49
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:19,045
Let's head off to work.

50
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,050
-Thank you.
-Sure.

51
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:27,970
You will not believe this.

52
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:30,970
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

53
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:33,083
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

54
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:35,283
A little. He seems really nice.

55
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:37,448
-Good kisser.
-What?

56
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:39,331
What?

57
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:41,205
-You kissed him?
-Totally.

58
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,770
Phoebe, are you serious?

59
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:46,368
He came in and introduced himself.

60
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:49,729
The next thing I know,
we're making out!

61
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,847
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

62
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,002
Phoebe.

63
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:59,522
I'm supposed to ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

64
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:02,281
No, yeah, I should.

65
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:15,840
Hey, Joey.

66
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:19,761
Can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

67
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:22,645
Do you know this kid?
ls it a relative?

68
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,683
No. I just thought it was cute.

69
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,247
That's what I was afraid of. Okay. . . .

70
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:30,885
I really want you to feel
at home here, but. . .

71
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,890
. . .some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

72
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:35,968
Like what?

73
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:39,528
Like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

74
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,411
We can't have that.

75
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:44,292
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

76
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,644
I don't know this baby. I don't know
if she's a famous artist or not.

77
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:55,044
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

78
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:58,369
I'm sorry. I wanted to make
the place a little nicer.

79
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,085
But it's too much stuff.

80
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:04,450
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

81
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:08,440
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

82
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:09,928
I just thought--

83
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:12,646
I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

84
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:13,682
But come on.

85
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:17,208
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

86
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,890
It's a curling iron.

87
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,850
Well, that's okay then.

88
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:31,368
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom. . .

89
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:35,446
. . .and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

90
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:40,365
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

91
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:41,368
It's clean.

92
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,290
It feels different.

93
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:44,845
It's dry.

94
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:49,890
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

95
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:53,165
Also what is with
these chips you bought?

96
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,045
It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

97
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:05,648
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

98
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,485
Kim, hi.

99
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:28,047
I handed in that marketing report, and
I never got to hear what you thought.

100
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:29,328
I didn't read it.

101
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:36,563
The spring line's really gonna be
great this year, huh?

102
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:46,162
I hear Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

103
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,771
Tell me everything.

104
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:54,481
Hey, guys.

105
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:56,440
What's up?

106
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,246
You know. . . .

107
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,045
Oh, my God.

108
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:04,531
What happened to your teeth?

109
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:06,051
I whitened them.

110
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:09,647
Really?

111
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:12,364
What do you think?

112
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:15,040
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

113
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,443
Come on, seriously.

114
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:23,451
-They're really, really, really white.
-What was wrong with your old. . .

115
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,284
. . .human teeth?

116
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,643
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

117
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:32,726
-How much longer?
-A day.

118
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:36,202
Tonight is your date with Hillary.

119
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:40,246
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

120
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,404
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

121
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:48,049
She will be after tonight.

122
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:52,403
Oh, Rach.
Do you notice anything--?

123
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:55,001
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

124
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:59,410
You guys are never gonna
believe this. . .

125
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,651
. . .but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

126
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,080
-What?
-Oh, my God!

127
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:08,648
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

128
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:11,650
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because. . .

129
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,207
. . .it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

130
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:17,051
I am proud of all my friends today.

131
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,890
I can't believe Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

132
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:23,202
I'm so jealous!

133
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,566
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

134
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:29,648
Chandler, please. Come on.

135
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:31,251
Look at him.

136
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:35,047
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

137
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:38,767
Here.

138
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:41,048
Who's the silver fox?

139
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:45,522
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

140
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:46,648
Oh, wait.

141
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:50,242
"Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please. "

142
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:54,043
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

143
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:55,688
What?

144
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:58,087
Ralph doesn't look like that guy.

145
00:08:58,332 --> 00:09:02,928
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack--

146
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:07,125
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy!

147
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,088
What?

148
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,765
I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

149
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:17,085
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!

150
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,726
Why would the copy guy say
he's Ralph Lauren?

151
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:21,684
To get you to make out with him!

152
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,643
This will make them look less white.

153
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:36,567
Nope.

154
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,489
Colors that don't work are. . .

155
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:43,611
. . .blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

156
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:48,443
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The date starts in an hour.

157
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:53,802
Maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

158
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:57,891
Oh, great! So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

159
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:01,086
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you--

160
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,765
Whoa!

161
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,167
We're not 1 3 anymore.

162
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:09,970
This is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

163
00:10:10,172 --> 00:10:12,049
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

164
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:14,368
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

165
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,846
What?

166
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:19,690
Half the people-- I mean--
Just try it and see.

167
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,087
I am not putting on makeup.

168
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:26,605
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

169
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:28,530
No! Demon! Demon!

170
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:39,251
Our drawers will smell nice, and
we didn't waste these pantyhose.

171
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,242
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

172
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:46,001
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

173
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,203
We've got to organize
the wrapping paper.

174
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:53,049
I've really gotten in touch with
my feminine side enough today.

175
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,483
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

176
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:01,645
This has been a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

177
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:04,286
I just feel like I need
to be in a "guy" place. . .

178
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,409
. . .do kind of a "man" thing.

179
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,887
You go over to Joey's and. . .

180
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,930
. . .drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

181
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:16,327
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

182
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:20,047
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

183
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:24,049
I'm sorry. We do.

184
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:25,844
I don't know why I said that.

185
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:31,451
Hey, Chandler.

186
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:34,842
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

187
00:11:36,732 --> 00:11:38,450
No, thanks, Josephine.

188
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,731
Ross, I was wondering if--

189
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:50,884
Oh, my God! Where are all the men?

190
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:04,246
-Hi, Kim.
-Hi, Rachel.

191
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:08,691
Remember what happened yesterday?
Well, it didn't happen.

192
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:11,201
You didn't cancel the fabric order?

193
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:14,447
Okay, two things didn't happen.

194
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:17,485
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

195
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,121
Well, it turns out that's not true.

196
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:22,288
It's not true?
That's interesting.

197
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,849
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copier. . .

198
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:30,647
. . .yesterday during lunch, and
that keycard belonged to you.

199
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,884
You think I made out with him?

200
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:33,888
Listen to me. . .

201
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:37,880
. . .sleeping with Ralph is not
gonna get you my job.

202
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,242
I don't want your job. I don't.

203
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:42,682
This is a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

204
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:46,641
Nobody made out with him.
I didn't use my keycard yesterday.

205
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,247
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

206
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:52,525
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

207
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,605
Yeah. Nothing happened.

208
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:16,009
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

209
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,801
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

210
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,127
Soon, I hope to open
my own restaurant.

211
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,248
You're a really great listener.

212
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:36,847
Most guys I go out with,
they talk and talk.

213
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,327
It's like, "Shut your mouth. "
You know?

214
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:48,244
I've been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

215
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,411
Come on, I want to know.

216
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,486
Okay. I'm from Long lsland.

217
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:02,168
I came to the city for college.

218
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:06,041
I have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time. . .

219
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:10,649
. . .I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you.

220
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:19,130
If you sear the stems of the flowers
first in a frying pan. . .

221
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:22,051
. . .your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

222
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:24,962
Joey, that is such a great tip!

223
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:29,602
Monica, I need to talk
to the girl with the flowers.

224
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,688
Okay, but I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder. . .

225
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:37,526
. . .out of a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

226
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:39,885
I love birds.

227
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:43,604
What is the matter with you?

228
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:46,004
-What?
-You're arranging flowers!

229
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:49,488
You got dead flowers!

230
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:52,530
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers!

231
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:55,527
This is not Joey!

232
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:58,690
Look, I am still Joey, okay?

233
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,685
Flowers, they're just nice to look at.

234
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:06,249
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

235
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:09,049
You're turning into a woman.

236
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:11,045
No, I'm not.

237
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:13,647
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

238
00:15:15,932 --> 00:15:18,127
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

239
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:21,246
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

240
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,361
Oh, my God!

241
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:25,330
I'm a woman!

242
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:35,487
So now she thinks that I made out
with him to get her job.

243
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:38,166
-Why didn't you just tell the truth?
-I did.

244
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:43,287
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

245
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:47,927
What if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

246
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:51,761
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

247
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,650
Did she ever think of that?

248
00:15:57,732 --> 00:15:59,563
You were with Kenny today.

249
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,490
Just for a second.

250
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,449
Phoebe, what am I gonna do?

251
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:07,882
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with him.

252
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:14,247
I'm not gonna sleep with him.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

253
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:16,601
Sleep with Kenny.

254
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,449
-That wouldn't help me.
-Oh, yes, it would.

255
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,568
I've had a really good time tonight.

256
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:32,248
I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

257
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:35,845
Me neither.

258
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:40,251
I've had a really
good time too, you know.

259
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,845
Are you gonna eat that bread?

260
00:16:45,052 --> 00:16:47,646
I just like the smell.

261
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:51,721
You make me laugh.

262
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:56,088
Would you like to move to the couch?

263
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,280
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

264
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,043
How about all the way?

265
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:08,641
Okay.

266
00:17:15,612 --> 00:17:17,250
Wow, cool poster.

267
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,842
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

268
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,520
So. . .

269
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:26,445
. . .where were we?

270
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,690
Are those your teeth?

271
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:38,087
You can see them, huh?

272
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,846
Yes. They're insanely white.

273
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:43,249
I did that for you.

274
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,043
What's the matter with you?

275
00:17:47,452 --> 00:17:51,843
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1 999!

276
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:01,163
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

277
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:05,968
Hi, Rachel. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

278
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:09,249
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

279
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:10,880
Okay, look.

280
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,248
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

281
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:18,043
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

282
00:18:18,252 --> 00:18:19,321
Oh, really?

283
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,848
Yeah, he dumped me.

284
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:26,282
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

285
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:29,569
Even though you're a very, very. . .

286
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:32,042
. . .very beautiful woman. . .

287
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,688
. . .I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry. "

288
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:39,049
But he said,
"And you will never get promoted. . .

289
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:43,040
. . .especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog. . .

290
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:44,964
. . .in the Ralph Lauren machine. "

291
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,641
You expect me to believe--

292
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,524
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Kim.

293
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:12,164
Oh, my God.

294
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:17,327
He gave you the coldest look I've
ever seen. It's like he hates you!

295
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:19,045
Then it is true!

296
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:24,644
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

297
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:27,482
Oh, honey, come here.

298
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,484
Oh, it'll be okay.

299
00:19:30,492 --> 00:19:33,052
We've all been there.

300
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,524
You and Ralph?

301
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:40,923
Kenny the copy boy.

302
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:57,529
-I need to talk to you.
-What's the matter? You upset?

303
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:00,690
We gotta get rid of all
this girlie stuff in here.

304
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,081
I gotta be a man!

305
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:06,242
The living room has to
remain a guy place, okay?

306
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,164
That's the way it has to be.

307
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,886
I'll just put it all in my room.

308
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:12,684
Good. Great.

309
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:15,287
Thanks for being so understanding.

310
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:18,092
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

311
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:22,643
But you could put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

312
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:24,610
I mean, if you want to.

313
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:27,762
Okay.

314
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:30,651
And maybe the watering can there.

315
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:31,728
Sure.

316
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:34,446
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

317
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:38,769
Joey, do you want me to put
it all in your room?

318
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:39,882
Okay.

00:00:02,652 --> 00:00:06,281
Why is everybody using
these tiny little lights nowadays?

2
00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:08,488
I remember when people used big ones.

3
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:11,081
That's a good story, Grandpa.

4
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:18,606
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

5
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,968
Did someone get her
drunk again, or. . .?

6
00:00:22,612 --> 00:00:25,570
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

7
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,610
It's about being with loved ones.

8
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:30,207
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

9
00:00:32,292 --> 00:00:35,329
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

10
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:37,810
Oh, here.

11
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:42,644
See, now it feels like Christmas.

And that's the story of the dreidel.

15
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:31,001
Some people trace the Christmas tree
back to the Egyptians. . .

16
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:35,728
. . .who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year. . .

17
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,406
. . .symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

18
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:41,450
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

19
00:01:41,692 --> 00:01:45,162
So, around the same time
that you started telling this story.

20
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:50,528
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey. What's up?

21
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:54,845
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over the place.

22
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,003
Everywhere I look she's like. . . .

23
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:03,600
I can see why that's hard to resist.

24
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,969
I like her so much.

25
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,930
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

26
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:09,810
I know. And she's so sweet.

27
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:13,601
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

28
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:17,086
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

29
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:22,490
I am so over Janine.

30
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:27,962
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

31
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:30,802
-Hey, guys.
-Janine!

32
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:36,204
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

33
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:40,206
It's called some sort of
Dickin ' Rockin ' Dicky Eve.

34
00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:44,405
Hold it.

35
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:48,202
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin ' Eve?

36
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:50,204
Yeah, that's what I said.

37
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:55,411
Oh, my God, we love that show!

38
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:58,530
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

39
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:02,003
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

40
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,566
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

41
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:11,408
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

42
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:15,043
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

43
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:17,886
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

44
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:20,771
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why--

45
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:22,411
Well, how it works is. . .

46
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:26,241
. . .the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

47
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:29,404
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

48
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:31,882
Not a lot of people know that.

49
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,850
Do you guys want to come too?

50
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:38,604
-Are you serious?
-We are there!

51
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,564
What are you laughing at?

52
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:47,566
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

53
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:52,806
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

54
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:54,923
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

55
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:57,403
Bye, Janine.

56
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:01,203
Did she just ask me out on a date?

57
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:04,007
I don't think so.

58
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:07,489
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

59
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:10,121
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

60
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:13,444
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

61
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,450
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

62
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:18,330
It's a New Year's Eve party.

63
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:22,804
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

64
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:25,722
If she says, "What are you doing?"

65
00:04:25,972 --> 00:04:28,611
I can say, "It wasn't me,
it was New Year's. "

66
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:33,132
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school. . .

67
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:36,808
. . .and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

68
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:40,769
It was a dry day.

69
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:48,210
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin ' Eve!

70
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:50,204
Oh, my God!

71
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:52,408
Oh, my God!

72
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,530
Oh, my God!

73
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:03,528
Okay, I've been on sets before. . .

74
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:05,410
. . .so let me give you some advice.

75
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:08,843
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

76
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,004
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

77
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,804
-Got it.
-Okay.

78
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:17,011
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

79
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,520
Everyone! Gather up!

80
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:22,408
-Excuse us!
-Excuse us!

81
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:26,052
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance. . .

82
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,250
. . .we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

83
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:33,007
Yeah, I have a question.
When is this gonna air?

84
00:05:34,412 --> 00:05:36,846
Yeah. Now, you guys dance
over there. . .

85
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:39,731
. . .you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

86
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,803
And everyone else, spread out.

87
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:45,609
So when is it gonna air?

88
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:52,807
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

89
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,203
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

90
00:05:57,052 --> 00:06:01,011
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

91
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,401
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

92
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:05,846
That's terrible.

93
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:07,650
No, we do it every year.

94
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:10,201
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

95
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,125
Yeah, we never find them.

96
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:17,047
She's always bested us,
that wily. . .minx.

97
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:19,803
We'll search here for an hour. . .

98
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,606
. . .and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

99
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:26,049
-You can't look for Monica's presents.
-We have to.

100
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:30,211
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

101
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,886
Well, then you should look with us.

102
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:35,408
Why?

103
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:38,246
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

104
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,608
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

105
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:43,685
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

106
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:47,326
What if she gets you
a great present. . .

107
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:49,608
. . .two mediums
and lots of little ones. . .

108
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:52,849
. . .and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

109
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:55,526
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

110
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:59,488
-If I help, we can find them faster!
-Right!

111
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:03,007
We have a live one!

112
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:05,806
-Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
-Yeah.

113
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:09,201
Who's it for?

114
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:14,851
"Dear Losers, do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

115
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,722
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you. "

116
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:24,400
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

117
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:28,130
We are so gonna find them this year.

118
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:32,001
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

119
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,241
Yeah.

120
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:36,052
You don't go into the back
of my closet. . .

121
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:38,567
. . .and look under my gym bag
or anything?

122
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,650
-No. Never do that.
-No.

123
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:47,644
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

124
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:52,203
Okay, that did not just happen.

125
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:01,047
Here comes a camera.

126
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:04,204
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

127
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,443
Why do they keep doing that?

128
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,411
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

129
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,290
They've been taping them all day.

130
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:21,601
Right.

131
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,522
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

132
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,251
We learned how to dance.

133
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:35,048
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

134
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,088
Yeah!

135
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,125
-Hey, you're a good dancer.
-Really?

136
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,442
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

137
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,206
-What do you mean?
-Like this.

138
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:53,567
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

139
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,805
You're dancing with her.

140
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,441
-We're together.
-Yeah, we came together.

141
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:02,605
I don't see it.

142
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:06,802
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall Guy, raise your hand!

143
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:12,329
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
I like her and I think I have a shot.

144
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,608
Really, you think so? I don't.

145
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,126
I couldn't find anything--
Hey, wait!

146
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:35,441
Yeah, we found them.

147
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,648
They were in the guest room closet.

148
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:40,850
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

149
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:45,528
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

150
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:50,961
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

151
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,243
Chandler, what is this very weird
metal A-Z thing?

152
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:59,529
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.

153
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,809
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az. "

154
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:08,250
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

155
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:09,686
Yes, okay.

156
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:14,244
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved. . .

157
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:17,131
. . .you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.

158
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:34,007
Hey, dancing girl?

159
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:37,403
Can I go to the bathroom?

160
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,403
Here we go. Yeah.

161
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,845
Looking good, Gellers!

162
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,411
We know!

163
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:55,528
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.

164
00:10:55,772 --> 00:10:57,410
-We should go dance by him.
-Okay.

165
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,010
Okay, everybody, hold!

166
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,411
Next on the platforms are. . . .

167
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,886
You two! And. . . .

168
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,650
-You two!
-Cool!

169
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:23,405
Excuse me? Sir?

170
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:26,212
Would it help if I weren't
wearing underpants?

171
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:28,081
Would it?

172
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:37,606
Hey, Tall Guy!

173
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:41,810
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.

174
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:45,607
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.

175
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,125
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

176
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:54,042
Look, I came with that girl, okay?

177
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:56,852
I plan to kiss her
at the New Year's countdown.

178
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,730
I'm trying to win her over. I--

179
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:00,405
I don't think so.

180
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,410
You can dance with my partner.

181
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,608
She's real mellow.

182
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:09,242
Look, you dating this girl
you came with?

183
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,847
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe. . . .

184
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:15,209
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.

185
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:16,806
All right. Hey.

186
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:21,205
Fair is fair. When you're right,
you're right. What can I say?

187
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,931
Are you in second grade?

188
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:29,812
Hey, man. You're the one
who wet his pants.

189
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:38,686
Man, this sucks.

190
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:42,049
If Mom and Dad don't see us
on TV after we made them jealous. . .

191
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,408
. . .then who's gonna be
the losers then?

192
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,771
I know what'll get us up
on a platform.

193
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:49,768
What?

194
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:51,971
The routine!

195
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:56,211
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.

196
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:58,727
When the snippy guy
sees the routine. . .

197
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:01,327
. . .he'll want to build us
our own platform.

198
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,766
Was it that good?

199
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:06,925
We got honorable mention in the
brother/sister dance category!

200
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:10,528
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?

201
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,810
Okay, let's do it.

202
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:17,204
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

203
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,443
Five, six, seven, eight!

204
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:09,884
So, do we really need to ask who's
going up on the platform next?

205
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,970
You get up there and do that
again, exactly like that.

206
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:19,610
Get this. Dick will want
it for the Bloopers show.

207
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:23,206
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!

208
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:25,482
When we start,
it'll be the countdown. . .

209
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:28,610
. . .so I want to see
everybody's excitement!

210
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:30,121
Hey, guy!

211
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:32,283
You got three seconds to get away.

212
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:33,806
What's going on here?

213
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:36,088
Take a look at the guy's pants!

214
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:40,686
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?

215
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:43,804
What's the matter with you? Go!

216
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:45,968
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!

217
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:49,720
Can you believe this?

218
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,008
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!

219
00:14:52,212 --> 00:14:53,042
I know!

220
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:56,531
You haven't been practicing
the routine, have you?

221
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:58,405
No.

222
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,011
Me too!

223
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:03,245
When the music starts. . .

224
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:06,404
. . .I was thinking about maybe
going into the robot.

225
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:13,041
Ross? We should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.

226
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:17,566
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.

227
00:15:17,812 --> 00:15:20,770
-Ten.
-Nine, eight.

228
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:21,768
Seven.

229
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:24,242
Okay, it all comes down to this.

230
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:27,404
Whatever happens, happens.

231
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:29,604
Destiny.

232
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,724
--three, two, one!

233
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:34,644
-Cut!
-No!

234
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:38,444
--year!

235
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,206
Happy No Year!

236
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,207
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!

237
00:15:58,692 --> 00:15:59,807
Hey, look who I found.

238
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:01,405
Oh, hi, guys!

239
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:04,401
Birds have a very good
sense of direction.

240
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:07,405
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.

241
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:11,808
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.

242
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:16,291
Or we could just follow your clever
jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.

243
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:20,361
Come on, show us where
the presents are.

244
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,445
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.

245
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:27,207
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.

246
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,690
How about my "az"?

247
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,732
Hey. This is hollow.

248
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:37,728
What?

249
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:41,601
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!

250
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:46,329
-Oh, the presents!
-Don't look directly at them!

251
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:49,241
What?

252
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:51,801
All right, no, we could look at them.

253
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,411
This one's for me!

254
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,807
This one's for Chandler. Here.

255
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:59,402
-And the big one's for me!
-Oh, let's open them!

256
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:03,609
-Wait a minute. We can't do this.
-Why?

257
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:07,003
I don't want to know
what Monica got me.

258
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:10,807
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.

259
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:12,923
And you guys are gonna ruin that.

260
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:16,369
We have to put them back.
This isn't what Christmas is about.

261
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,683
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.

262
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:25,609
Nobody is opening anything, okay?

263
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:29,441
I want to see the look on her face
when I give her my present.

264
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:33,048
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.

265
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:36,921
So, please, please, can we just. . .?
Can we put them back?

266
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:40,201
-Will you get us better gifts?
-Fine.

267
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:43,811
Hey, guys.

268
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,371
You found the presents?

269
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,683
You let them find the presents?

270
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:50,808
Great.

271
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:54,800
Do you know how long it took me
to find you that water purifier?

272
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:59,162
-That's what you got me?
-Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

273
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,608
Home sweet home, huh?

274
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:11,324
Nice to get back to reality.

275
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:16,402
Plus, we know how the New Year's
gonna go off.

276
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:20,043
I guess there's no reason for all
that Y2K panic, you know?

277
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,604
Anyway, good night.

278
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,010
-Joey?
-Yeah?

279
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:29,811
Three. . .

280
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:32,208
. . .two, one.

281
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:40,765
Happy New Year.

282
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:46,891
What was that for?

283
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:50,409
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss. . .

284
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:54,400
. . .I was really, really disappointed,
and I just. . . .

285
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:56,803
I just really wanted to kiss you.

286
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,605
Really?

287
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:03,846
In the moment, I really wanted
to kiss you too. In the moment.

288
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,647
-In the moment.
-But only in the moment.

289
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:12,651
So do you want to kiss again?

290
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,410
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.

291
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:17,801
Can you wait?

292
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:19,605
No.

293
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:22,561
Me neither.

294
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:28,291
Three, two. . . .

295
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:30,727
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.

296
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:32,803
Oh. Okay.

297
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:38,602
Except I sort of felt like I needed
a couple seconds to get ready.

298
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:04,008
We were on the platform, ready to
dance into the new millennium. . .

299
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,806
. . .and the guy yells "cut! "

300
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:10,650
So you guys are telling me
that you actually did. . .

301
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,201
. . .the routine from eighth grade?

302
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:17,128
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.

303
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:20,205
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.

304
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:23,926
There's no way you could've
done the end. . .

305
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,447
. . .the way you guys did it back then.

306
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:30,728
What? We could do it.

307
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:35,727
I don't know. You were a lot bigger--
I mean, stronger back then.

308
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,130
I can do it, okay?

309
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,802
Come on, let's go! Come on.

310
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,650
One, two, three, four. . .

311
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:47,328
. . .five, six, seven, eight.

312
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:49,005
I can't do it!

313
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:54,403
Now, you do that, you're on TV.

You think I have a chance with Janine?

We've been through this.

4
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:13,005
Don't do this to yourself.

5
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,482
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

6
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:19,042
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited. . .

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,765
. . .that I just kissed her!

-Are you serious?
-That's great!

Yeah, well, we'll see.

10
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:28,041
You kissed her?

11
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:31,046
We kissed it up real nice.

12
00:00:31,812 --> 00:00:33,643
So you kissed. Then what happened?

13
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,248
I came over here to tell you guys.

14
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:39,163
So she's waiting over
there for you?

15
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:41,841
Yeah.

-Okay.

00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:33,368
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:34,561

-Okay, now I'm really leaving.
-All right.

22
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:40,761
But can you just. . .

23
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:42,843
. . .just leave your lips?

24
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:50,765
Have you kissed her yet?

25
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:54,051
It's awesome!

26
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:55,685
I could do it forever.

27
00:01:55,932 --> 00:02:00,403
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

28
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:03,246
I'm so glad you said "cooks. "

29
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,482
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

Monica, look.

35
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:24,971
Here is that table that I ordered.

-Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,642
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

38
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,728
A pharmacist.

39
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:35,641
"A pharmacist. "

40
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:40,043
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

41
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:41,765
I hate Pottery Barn too.

42
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,970
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

43
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,806
You took off your pants and
got under the sheets.

44
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:51,641
I was tired.

45
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,450
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

46
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,449
She hates mass-produced stuff.

47
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,445
She thinks her furniture should
have a story behind it.

48
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:02,569
This has a story behind it.

49
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:06,851
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

50
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,648
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

51
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:15,726
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

52
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:18,651
Hey! I made that for her.

53
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,531
-You made pottery?
-Yeah.

54
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:24,690
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

55
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:30,288
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

56
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,642
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

57
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:35,247
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

58
00:03:35,892 --> 00:03:37,484
I love these little drawers.

59
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:40,485
Oh, look! It says that
it holds 300 CDs.

60
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:43,644
Just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

61
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:51,647
So the farmer says:

62
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:54,645
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking. "

63
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,284
I'm so glad you're together.

64
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:01,604
We wanted a couple to go out with
and now we have one.

65
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,650
We're a couple of couples.

66
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:07,685
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

67
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,447
And Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

68
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:15,321
Thanks again, man.

69
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:19,485
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

70
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,045
-That'd be great!
-Okay.

71
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,569
But at least let us
bring the wine.

72
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:27,043
-You don't have to.
-I insist.

73
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,043
-You'll get the wine, right?
-Yeah.

74
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:35,887
-Okay, good night.
-See you tomorrow.

75
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,406
Can't wait.

76
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,646
How are we going to get
out of that one?

77
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,011
I can't handle two
nights in a row with them.

78
00:04:53,652 --> 00:04:55,085
What's wrong with them?

79
00:04:55,332 --> 00:04:56,970
They're just a little. . .

80
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,406
. . .blah!

81
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,926
Blah?

82
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:05,002
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just. . . .

83
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,886
She's very loud for such
a small person.

84
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:13,366
They're my best friends.

85
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:17,002
Are you saying we can't go out?
'Cause that'd be a problem.

86
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,880
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

87
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,009
Just not two nights in a row.

88
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:26,804
-Okay?
-I guess.

89
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,445
Thank you.

90
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,647
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

91
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:47,400
What a great table!
Where did you get it?

92
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,245
Guess.

93
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:51,960
A flea market?

94
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:55,000
I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

95
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:59,848
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

96
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,526
You can just imagine
that this is where. . .

97
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:06,240
. . .they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

98
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:10,248
You can almost smell the opium.

99
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:13,487
Almost.

100
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:14,967
How much was it?

101
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:16,691
Just only 500 bucks.

102
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,484
500 bucks at a flea market?

103
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:22,050
I thought you meant how much was it. . .

104
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:24,169
. . .when it was new, back then.

105
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:28,650
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

106
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:33,052
-A dollar?
-And fifty?

107
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:35,846
So it was like
one and fifty dollars.

108
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:39,850
-They gave you the old-time pricing.
-Yeah.

109
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,524
Well, what period is it from?

110
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:44,280
It's from yore.

111
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:46,568
Like, the "days of yore," you know?

112
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:48,887
Yes, I do.

113
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:52,169
-It's just perfect.
-Oh, good.

114
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,403
I bet it has a great story too.

115
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,648
Did they tell you
where it's from or. . . .

116
00:06:56,892 --> 00:07:00,248
Yes, that I know.
This is from White Plains.

117
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,040
White Plains.

118
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:06,050
It sounds like such a magical place.

119
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:12,845
-I'm here.
-Hi!

120
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,281
Oh, my God!

121
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,170
-You like it?
-Oh, my God!

122
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:19,926
It's my new apothecary table!

123
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,200
Phoebe'll be here any second.
She can't see this.

124
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:26,046
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

125
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:27,890
I got it at Pottery Barn.

126
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:30,843
I know. I bought the same one.

127
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,646
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

128
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,412
-I said ours was an original.
-Why?

129
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,489
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

130
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:41,929
She hates Pottery Barn?

131
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:44,688
She says it's all mass-produced. . .

132
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:48,641
. . .nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

133
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:54,290
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

134
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:57,562
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

135
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:00,889
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

136
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,248
I forgot they made sheets!

137
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:10,885
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

138
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:12,691
It's not like she hates you.

139
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,843
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

140
00:08:17,732 --> 00:08:19,962
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

141
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:23,404
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

142
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:27,922
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

143
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:32,483
You know what's not one-of-a-kind?
A twin!

144
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:39,726
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

145
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,400
-Hey, cool sheet!
-You like it?

146
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:46,246
-You want to know where I got it?
-Sure.

147
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:47,805
At a flea market.

148
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:51,562
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

149
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:55,649
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

150
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:01,487
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

151
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,200
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

152
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:07,568
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers. . .

153
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:11,043
. . .but you couldn't because
you paid for dinner last night.

154
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:14,924
Thanks. But it's just
gonna be me tonight.

155
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:18,841
-What happened to Janine?
-She's really sick.

156
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:22,051
-That's too bad.
-Yeah, she's been in there all day.

157
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:25,767
High fever, nose problem.
It's. . .

158
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:28,202
. . .phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

159
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,445
Monica! Chandler!

160
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:37,842
I'm sorry about tonight. I don't
know if Joey told you. . .

161
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:41,010
. . .but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

162
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,847
Have a great time, huh?

163
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:51,568
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

164
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,245
Oh, no, she really is sick.

165
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,289
Then why is she going to a play?

166
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:02,767
Well, you know, "Starve a fever. . .

167
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,764
. . .go to a play for a cold. "

168
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:09,563
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

169
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:13,725
She didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

170
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:15,041
I'm so sorry.

171
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:18,048
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

172
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,122
Because she thinks that
you are "blah. "

173
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,760
And that you, Monica,
are too loud.

174
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:29,451
What?!

175
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,968
What?

176
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:35,248
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

177
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,283
She was lying to our faces?

178
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:39,682
I can't believe this.
Who is she to judge us?

179
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:44,130
-We couldn't have been nicer to her.
-And I am not "blah. " I am a hoot!

180
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:47,841
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

181
00:10:48,052 --> 00:10:49,644
I'm sure she said it. . .

182
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:53,049
. . .because she was nervous 'cause
you're my best friends.

183
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,163
And it was our first date.

184
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:58,085
Plus, she's really sick.

185
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:02,009
You said you made that up!

186
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:05,010
But isn't the "sick" thing
better than the "play" thing?

187
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,966
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again. "

188
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:14,564
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

189
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:18,088
-She'll come around, I promise.
-Of course we will.

190
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:20,846
-Come on, we gotta make dinner.
-Okay.

191
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:26,645
I do not like that woman!

192
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:29,043
I can hear you!

193
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:32,163
I am loud!

194
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:45,449
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new. . .

195
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,445
. . .old sheet.

196
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,001
Oh, sure.

197
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:52,368
My apothecary table!

198
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,043
-What?
-No!

199
00:11:55,892 --> 00:11:58,884
-Where did you get this?
-At Pottery Barn, okay?

200
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:03,164
Oh, my God!

201
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:07,571
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

202
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:11,966
If they've ripped off our table. . .

203
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:15,841
. . .ours must be worth much more
than one and fifty dollars.

204
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:19,287
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

205
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:22,285
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

206
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,369
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

207
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:28,441
Ross, calm down. I'll give
you the 80 cents.

208
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,090
Okay, one more time.

209
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:37,050
Would you like some orange juice?

210
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:40,528
-Perfect decibel.
-I know!

211
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:45,764
What are you guys doing?

212
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:49,402
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

213
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:53,126
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

214
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:56,847
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

215
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:58,644
-What do you say?
-I'd like to. . .

216
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:00,843
. . .but I'm not sure if
we have the time.

217
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:04,441
Very funny. I don't know
what to do.

218
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,569
I really want you to get along.

219
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,326
Please, come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

220
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,165
-We owe you?
-That's right.

221
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:14,250
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

222
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,488
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

223
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:18,444
I looked like an idiot.

224
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:20,085
And I was humiliated.

225
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,924
And I only made $200.

226
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,247
We didn't give you any money.

227
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:31,090
You don't think I know that?

228
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,290
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair. . .

229
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:39,681
. . .the Sahara desk. . .

230
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,888
. . .or the Parker console table.

231
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:44,447
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

232
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:47,968
-I know, I went a little crazy.
-A little?

233
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:50,891
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

234
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:53,486
Look at that!

235
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:57,651
The ornamental birdcage!
Large.

236
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:03,244
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

237
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:07,565
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

238
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,047
Fascinating.

239
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:14,482
Another amazing find!

240
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:18,965
-I bet this has a great story too.
-It does.

241
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:23,603
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

242
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:28,444
A lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

243
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:31,371
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

244
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:35,286
Well, there's yore.

245
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:40,400
And, you know, yesteryear.

246
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:45,850
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

247
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:48,367
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate--

248
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:50,682
--and I think you should--

249
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,650
--you should ask Rachel to help.

250
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,450
He doesn't need my help.

251
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:57,849
I think he's ready to get rid
of the-- What'd you call it?

252
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,731
The "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

253
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,442
Really?

254
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:11,246
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need--

255
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,448
Here's 60 bucks.

256
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:17,645
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial flea market. . .

257
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:19,530
. . .and get me some stuff?

258
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,882
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

259
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,730
-I do want to.
-She does want to.

260
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:29,684
-She does want to.
-Yeah!

261
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:39,082
I guess the flea market was
just better last time.

262
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:42,244
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

263
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:46,649
Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.

264
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,492
You know what? Don't look at it.

265
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,041
-Seriously, don't look at it.
-Look!

266
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,169
There's the table
they stole from us.

267
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,323
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

268
00:15:57,932 --> 00:16:02,244
That fan kind of looks like ours,
and the birdcage, and. . . .

269
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:05,405
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

270
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,682
No, it's not.

271
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,162
Come on, ours is totally different.

272
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:13,882
I mean, we don't have the--
We don't have that lamp.

273
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:18,850
And that screen is on
the other side.

274
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:22,889
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

275
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,441
Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!

276
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,441
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:32,571
I wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

278
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:35,485
-Come on, don't be mad.
-No, but I am mad.

279
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:38,929
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world. . .

280
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,043
. . .and it's in my living room. . .

281
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,841
. . .and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

282
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,049
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

283
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:50,368
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

284
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,646
I can't! I can't!

285
00:16:55,132 --> 00:16:56,645
Unless. . . .

286
00:16:56,852 --> 00:17:00,322
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

287
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,529
No, I'm not gonna move out!

288
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:06,645
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

289
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:11,241
-Yes! I would so move out.
-Then I don't have a choice.

290
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:14,046
-I have to buy that lamp!
-That's right.

291
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:18,090
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

292
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:26,083
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

293
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,926
I did. I really did.
And I've got to say. . .

294
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,363
. . .I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

295
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,369
I guess I was just nervous.

296
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:37,126
-That's understandable.
-Don't worry about it.

297
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:38,481
So we can go out again?

298
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:40,884
-Absolutely.
-Well, good.

299
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:48,486
See?

300
00:17:48,812 --> 00:17:49,801
Wasn't that fun?

301
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,849
We have got to move.

302
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:54,006
What?

303
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,407
I knew it!

304
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,482
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

305
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:04,244
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance. . .

306
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:05,680
. . .is you talking about it.

307
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:09,242
"Oh, Chandler, I just lost
myself in the movement. "

308
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:14,648
You know, I know you're talking. . .

309
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:17,446
. . .but all I hear is
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

310
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:20,729
All right, you and me!
Let's go, right now!

311
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:22,161
All right, enough!

312
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:26,249
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

313
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:28,648
I really think you could take her.

314
00:18:29,452 --> 00:18:32,125
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

315
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:37,721
All right.

316
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,085
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

317
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,448
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

318
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:47,565
-They said stuff to me too.
-I know, I'll talk to them about it.

319
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:49,891
They mean so much to me.

320
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:52,282
They're like my family, you know?

321
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,604
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time. . . .

322
00:18:56,892 --> 00:19:00,441
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

323
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:01,926
It can't.

324
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:03,969
I'm very upset.

325
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:06,765
Okay.

326
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,082
Would it help if I apologized?

327
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:10,880
Yeah.

328
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:12,804
That'd be very helpful.

329
00:19:17,652 --> 00:19:20,120
What did I tell you about the hall?

330
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:24,971
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

331
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,046
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

332
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:35,770
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so. . .

333
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:38,048
. . .I would like that too.

334
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:40,769
-Great.
-Now, come on.

335
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:46,642
-I'm glad we worked it out.
-Me too.

336
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,649
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

337
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:51,804
-Or I'll hear you.
-That's it, big girl!

338
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:54,568
Wait!

339
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:00,325
You'd better run!

340
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,046
Did you hear that?

341
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:07,286
-What am I gonna do?
-I'm sorry, man.

342
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:11,010
-Want to go watch?
-Yeah!

343
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:23,285
-How you doing?
-So did she move out?

344
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,165
Pretty much.

345
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:27,607
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

346
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:29,803
When it's not right, you know it.

347
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:33,090
-You okay?
-I'll be all right.

348
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:37,246
-You know what'd cheer you up?
-What?

349
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:41,925
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

350
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:45,204
I think you should come.

351
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:53,883
You're right, that did cheer me up.

00:00:03,372 --> 00:00:05,488
Hey! You're not gonna believe this.

2
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:08,371
I made up a joke
and sent it in to Playboy.

3
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:10,091
They printed it.

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:14,249
I didn't know they print jokes.

5
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:17,125
They print jokes, interviews,
hard-hitting journalism.

6
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:19,090
It's not just about the pictures.

7
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:21,681
Didn't work on Mom,
it's not gonna work on us.

8
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:24,842
Check it out. It's the first one.

9
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:27,480
Right there.

10
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:31,206
That is funny.

11
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:33,443
It was also funny when I made it up.

12
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,449
-What?
-I made that joke up.

13
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,404
No, you didn't. I did.

14
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:43,964
Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
was the funniest he'd joke ever heard.

15
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,123
Hey, tell Dan thanks.

16
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:51,401
What?

17
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,201
I was just reading the joke below it.
Man, that one is funny.

18
00:00:57,532 --> 00:01:00,683
Monica, you remember me
telling you that joke, right?

19
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,650
-No.
-Seriously?

20
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:04,844
You tell a lot of jokes.

21
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:07,727
Look, it's my joke.

22
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:11,203
But if it makes you feel better,
they don't print the name.

23
00:01:11,452 --> 00:01:13,807
So it doesn't really matter
who gets credit.

24
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:14,922
Yeah, I guess.

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,767
-Hey, guys.
-Playboy printed my joke!

26
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,691
No, it's mine! Call them!
They'll tell you!

27
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:21,921
-My joke!
-My joke!

28
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,491
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,490
Jokes? What. . .?

30
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:28,160
You know there's naked chicks
in there, right?

31
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:32,363
The One With The Joke

33
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,611
Dude! You have got to turn on
Behind The Music.

34
00:02:11,852 --> 00:02:15,242
The band Heart is having a tough
time and they may break up.

35
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:17,369
Let's watch that at your place.

36
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:20,888
Monica's watching a show. I don't
want to miss when they were skinny.

37
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,966
Hey, Chandler?
You know what we should do?

38
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:27,682
You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.

39
00:02:28,052 --> 00:02:30,247
What? No, I want to watch this.

40
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:36,487
-Did your cable go out?
-No. No, that's VH1 .

41
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,491
I tell you, the music
these kids listen to today. . .

42
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,125
. . .it's a lot of noise to me.

43
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:44,886
Why is your cable out?

44
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:48,564
Oh, because I haven't really
paid the bill.

45
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:52,124
If you need money,
would you please let me loan you some?

46
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,681
No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?

47
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:58,720
I know things have been tight since
Janine moved out. God, was she hot.

48
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,680
I know, yeah.

49
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:04,720
Look, I can handle it, all right?
I can listen to the radio.

50
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:07,844
And Ross gave me this great book.

51
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:12,082
Want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch at his place?

52
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,486
Sure.

53
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:16,965
-Paid your phone bill?
-No.

54
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:28,290
It's only you.

55
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,520
-What are you doing?
-Looking at a Playboy.

56
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:32,887
I want to look too!

57
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,280
Yikes!

58
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,083
Do you think these pictures
are trying to tell a story?

59
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:45,212
Sure. Like in the case
of this young woman. . .

60
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,602
. . .she has lost her clothes.

61
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:52,642
So she rides naked on the horse,
she's crying out, "Where are they?"

62
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:57,083
She's not gonna find them,
lying in the grass like that.

63
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,000
Remember the days when you'd
go out to the barn. . .

64
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:06,288
. . .Iift up your shirt and bend over?

65
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,284
You see, now, I would date this girl.

66
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:16,006
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.

67
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:19,289
And she knows how to build a fire.
That'll come in handy.

68
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:20,961
I got a question.

69
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,682
If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?

70
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:27,130
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

71
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:28,691
Rachel.

72
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:30,761
What?

73
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,083
I don't know.

74
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:36,080
Me neither.

75
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:43,685
You know, you forget how many
great songs Heart had.

76
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:49,081
"Barracuda" was the first song
I learned to play on the keyboard.

77
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:52,686
So you heard it, you repeated it. . .

78
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:55,492
. . .so that must mean you wrote it.

79
00:04:57,452 --> 00:05:00,125
You guys with this joke.
Well, I gotta say. . .

80
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:03,045
. . .I know I cracked up,
but I'm not even sure I got it.

81
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:04,646
What?

82
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:06,526
You didn't get it?

83
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,332
The doctor is a monkey.

84
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,886
And monkeys
can't write out prescriptions.

85
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:17,886
You are not allowed
to laugh at my joke.

86
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:20,091
Your joke?

87
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:23,090
Well, I think the Hef
would disagree.

88
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,527
Which is why he sent me a check. . .

89
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:27,888
. . .for $1 00.

90
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:31,289
So you stole my joke
and you stole my money?

91
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,483
I was gonna stick it in the ATM.

92
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:36,485
But now I think I'll show
the sexy teller. . .

93
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:39,405
. . .that I am a published writer.

94
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:41,768
She'll know that you stole the joke.

95
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:43,411
You gonna follow me there?

96
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:45,370
-Yeah.
-I'm not gonna go now.

97
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,886
Okay.

98
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:50,891
Here you go.

99
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:55,041
Gunther?

100
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:57,921
I can't pay now,
because I'm not working.

101
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:00,686
I've had to cut down
on some luxuries like. . .

102
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,281
. . .paying for stuff, so. . . .

103
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:06,883
Well, if you want, you can work here.

104
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:08,886
I don't know.

105
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:10,286
It's just. . . .

106
00:06:10,772 --> 00:06:13,889
See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
you know?

107
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:16,890
And to go from that to this,
it's just. . . .

108
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:19,805
And plus, I'd have to wait
on all my friends.

109
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,730
Okay. But the money's good.

110
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,691
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel
as much as you want.

111
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:28,480
What?

112
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,683
Flexible hours.

113
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,610
Maybe I could be a waiter.

114
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,171
Could I use the phone?

115
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,400
She picked Rachel.

116
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:47,884
She tried to back out of it, but
it was obvious. She picked Rachel.

117
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:51,091
He took my joke. He just took it.

118
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:54,406
This is wrong.
You know what else is wrong?

119
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:56,290
Phoebe picking Rachel.

120
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:58,329
Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.

121
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:01,291
Know what else Ross did?
He stole my joke.

122
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:05,122
I'm gonna get a joke journal,
you know?

123
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:08,682
And document the date and time
of every single one of my jokes.

124
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:11,087
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?

125
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,482
-Picking Rachel.
-That's right.

126
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,525
Did you hear something?

127
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,731
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
into my brain to steal my thoughts.

128
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:24,488
It's coming from the living room.

129
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,686
I finished my book.

130
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:41,487
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

131
00:07:41,732 --> 00:07:43,688
Don't you guys look cute.

132
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,770
You guys make a cute couple.

133
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:48,771
What are you doing?

134
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:52,891
Just trying to re-create some of
the fun that we had at my place.

135
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,327
Remember? When you picked
Rachel over me?

136
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,483
That was funny.

137
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:00,686
-It was kind of funny.
-It wasn't funny at all!

138
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,724
Why would you do that?

139
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,803
Why didn't you pick me?

140
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,280
Fine.

141
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:11,486
The reason I was leaning a little
bit more toward Rachel than you. . .

142
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,489
. . .is just, you know, you're. . .

143
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,123
. . .high maintenance.
Let's go to lunch!

144
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:18,681
That is completely untrue.

145
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,127
You think I'm high maintenance?
Prove it.

146
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:24,808
You write out a list, and
we'll go through it point by point.

147
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:28,923
No, you're right, you're easygoing.

148
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:34,202
You're just not as easygoing
as Rachel. She's just more. . .

149
00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:36,647
. . .flexible and mellow. That's all.

150
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,048
Well, people are different.

151
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:46,971
Rachel will do whatever you want.
You can just walk all over her.

152
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:51,806
What? Are you saying that I'm
a pushover? I'm not a pushover.

153
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:55,084
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.

154
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:59,325
You think I'm a pushover.
Well, watch this.

155
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,324
You're not invited to lunch!

156
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,927
What do you think?
Pretty strong, I think.

157
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,288
Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.

158
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:10,488
You start working on that list.

159
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,722
-I cannot believe her.
-I know. Where do you want to eat?

160
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,287
-Oh, I love that Japanese place.
-I'm sick of Japanese. Not there.

161
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:22,887
Wherever you want to go is cool.

162
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:28,926
Oh, hey, Gunther. . .

163
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,685
. . .check this out.

164
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,681
Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.

165
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,525
You want anything to drink?
I'm heading up there.

166
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,048
-I'll take a coffee. Thanks.
-Sure.

167
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:46,806
-Coffee?
-No.

168
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,531
Coffee? I'm going up there.

169
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:49,926
No, thank you.

170
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,727
You need anything?
I'm heading up there.

171
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:55,400
I'd love ice water.

172
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:57,085
You got it.

173
00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,686
What are you doing?

174
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,206
Just being friendly.

175
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,761
You're not supposed to go back there.

176
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,331
It's okay. Right?

177
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,684
Don't wink at me.

178
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,689
And put on your apron.

179
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:16,766
Okay.

180
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:20,482
I don't see you asking other
paying customers to put on aprons.

181
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,366
-Joey, do you work here?
-No.

182
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,045
-Waiter.
-Yeah!

183
00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:35,125
What's going on?
Why didn't you tell us you work here?

184
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:42,525
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.

185
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,888
It's supposed to go
the other direction.

186
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:48,286
So's your apron.
You're wearing it like a cape.

187
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:52,530
I mean, the job's easy
and the money's good, you know?

188
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:56,526
I guess if I'm hanging out here,
I might as well get paid for it.

189
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:59,844
I just feel kind of weird
serving you guys, you know?

190
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,121
It'll be great.

191
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:03,681
Come on, I did it and it was fine.

192
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:05,325
Why would it be weird?

193
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,405
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?

194
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,488
It doesn't seem that weird.

195
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:14,292
I asked before.
You still haven't gotten it.

196
00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:18,088
See, now it's weird again.

197
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:22,048
You're gonna make a lot of money.
Here's your first tip.

198
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,488
Don't eat yellow snow.

199
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:30,406
2: 1 5, coffeehouse.

200
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,284
This is great. Finally,
someone I can pass my wisdom to.

201
00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:38,330
Let me tell you some things
I learned working here.

202
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,488
First, the customer is always right.

203
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:45,041
A smile goes a long way.

204
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:50,247
And if anyone is ever rude to you,
sneeze muffin.

205
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:53,121
Thanks, Rach.

206
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,690
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
you know?

207
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:00,890
How about clearing out
so I can get some new customers?

208
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,083
It's all about turnover.

209
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,049
Seriously, can I get my coffee?

210
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,483
I'm sorry. I'll get it right now.

211
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:14,691
And since you waited,
I'll toss in a free muffin.

212
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,763
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.

213
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,486
Okay.

214
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:27,730
So, maybe I am
a little high maintenance.

215
00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,725
And maybe Rachel is
a little bit of a pushover.

216
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,564
But you know what you are?

217
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:36,361
We are sorry to tell you this,
but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

218
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,410
That's true, I am flaky.

219
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:46,288
So, what, you're just okay
with being flaky?

220
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,090
Yeah, totally.

221
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,321
Then I'm okay
with being high maintenance.

222
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,325
Yeah. And I am okay
with being a pushover.

223
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,802
That's great. Good for you guys.

224
00:12:57,452 --> 00:13:00,091
-I am not high maintenance!
-I am not a pushover!

225
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,688
-Who said you were?
-You did!

226
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,167
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.

227
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:13,326
Hey, Gunther.

228
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,847
Can you cover for me?
I got an audition.

229
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,481
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.

230
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,044
I like your natural color.

231
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:27,808
It's a great part.
I'm the lead guy's best friend.

232
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:30,282
I wait for him and save his seat.
Listen.

233
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,482
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved. "

234
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:39,451
-That's the whole part?
-Maybe he's not his best friend.

235
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:40,881
I'll see you.

236
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,685
Oh, man.

237
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:47,521
I could totally get that part.
"I'm sorry, this seat is taken. "

238
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:50,923
-Excuse me.
-No, I didn't mean you.

239
00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,366
But you believed me?

240
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,289
I believed you were saving this seat
for someone.

241
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,531
So you'd hire me, right?

242
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,290
For what?

243
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:04,412
Exactly!
All right, everybody listen up!

244
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:07,291
The coffeehouse will be closed
for about an hour.

245
00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,568
What?

246
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,331
It's for the kids.

247
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:14,211
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.

248
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,888
It's a very important issue
in this month's Playboy.

249
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,889
I'm sure you all read about it.

250
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,088
-It's my joke.
-It's my joke.

251
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,924
It's my joke.

252
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,602
I don't think we're gonna settle this.

253
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,370
Let's have Monica decide.

254
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,565
-Hey, Mon!
-Get out here!

255
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,689
-Monica?
-Okay.

256
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,122
You have to decide whose joke this is.

257
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:51,321
Why do I have to?

258
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:53,608
You're the only one that can be fair.

259
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,649
I can't be. You're my boyfriend.

260
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,888
But I'm your brother. We're family.

261
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:01,767
That's the most important thing
in the world.

262
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,364
Don't try to sway her.

263
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:08,485
I'm your only chance to have a baby.

264
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,605
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.

265
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:17,288
We'll each tell you
how we came up with the joke. . .

266
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:21,320
. . .then you decide which one of us
is telling the truth. Me.

267
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:23,206
Chandler, you first.

268
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:26,683
I thought of the joke two months ago
at lunch with Steve.

269
00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:29,321
-Did I meet him at Christmas?
-Can I finish?

270
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:30,971
You want me to pick you?

271
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,289
See, I would never
snap at you like that.

272
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:39,526
Two babies.

273
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,486
-Continue.
-Okay.

274
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:49,208
Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.

275
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:54,287
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how
the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.

276
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:00,010
Are you kidding?

277
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,001
Okay, look, I study evolution.

278
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:04,605
Remember? Evolution.

279
00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:06,331
Monkey into man.

280
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:08,164
Plus, I'm a doctor. And. . .

281
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:11,290
. . .I had a monkey.

282
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,203
I'm Dr. Monkey!

283
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,082
I'm not arguing with that.

284
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,368
I've heard enough for my decision.

285
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:24,125
-Okay, so what--?
-Do tell.

286
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,442
You are both idiots.

287
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:30,520
It's not funny.
And it's offensive to women.

288
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,808
And doctors. And monkeys.

289
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,208
You shouldn't argue
over who gets credit.

290
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:41,082
You should argue over who gets blamed
for inflicting this joke on the world.

291
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:42,685
Now, let it go.

292
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,689
The joke sucks.

293
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:52,129
-It's your joke.
-It is not.

294
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:10,288
-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
-Hi.

295
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:12,928
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.

296
00:17:13,172 --> 00:17:14,491
Why don't you tell them. . .

297
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:18,082
. . .what you told me about me
not being high maintenance.

298
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:24,481
Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady.

299
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:29,050
Being with her
has been like being on a vacation.

300
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:34,125
And what may be perceived
as high maintenance. . .

301
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,886
. . .is merely attention to detail. . .

302
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:38,366
. . .and. . .

303
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:41,682
. . .generosity of spirit.

304
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:48,003
Wow. You know what? That is the best
fake speech I think I've ever heard.

305
00:17:48,252 --> 00:17:49,890
Really? I've heard better.

306
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:53,850
Wait, he came up with that himself.
Tell them.

307
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:57,003
I'm out of words.
Should I say it again?

308
00:17:57,252 --> 00:17:59,129
Look, I am not high maintenance!

309
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:01,124
I am not. Chandler!

310
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,688
You're a little high maintenance.

311
00:18:06,372 --> 00:18:08,010
You are on my list!

312
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:11,403
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not--

313
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:14,325
You're not easygoing,
but you're passionate.

314
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:15,766
And that's good.

315
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,721
And when you get upset about little
things, I think I'm pretty good. . .

316
00:18:19,972 --> 00:18:21,724
. . .at making you feel better.

317
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:24,770
That's good too.
They say you're high maintenance. . .

318
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:27,480
. . .but it's okay, because I like. . .

319
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:31,083
. . .maintaining you.

320
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:40,371
I didn't tell him that.

321
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:47,086
-You're off my list.
-I'm off the list.

322
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:48,680
Phoebe?

323
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:52,889
It's okay that you don't want me
to be your girlfriend.

324
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,770
I have the best boyfriend.

325
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:59,483
You know,
suddenly I find you very attractive.

326
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,005
How'd the audition go?

327
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:05,571
Oh, not good. No.

328
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:09,321
I didn't get the part.
And I lost my job here, so. . . .

329
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:11,369
Wow, that is a bad audition.

330
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,886
Well, how did you lose your job here?

331
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,326
I had the audition. . .

332
00:19:17,572 --> 00:19:21,042
. . .but Gunther said I had to stay
so he could get his hair dyed.

333
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:23,322
So I went anyway, and he fired me.

334
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:26,291
He left work
to do a personal errand. . .

335
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:29,723
. . .and left you in charge
when you've been here two days?

336
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,200
That's not right.

337
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,489
What are you gonna do?

338
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:36,286
You can't let him get away with that.

339
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:39,529
I won't let him get away with that.
I'm gonna say--

340
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:42,923
I shouldn't say anything.
No, I should say something!

341
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:49,084
Gunther?
I want you to give Joey his job back.

342
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:52,881
-It's not fair that you have to fire--
-Okay.

343
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:58,761
-What?
-He can have his job back.

344
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:03,050
That's right,
he can have his job back.

345
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:06,881
Glad we got that all straightened out.

346
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:09,406
There you go, Joey.

347
00:20:09,652 --> 00:20:12,928
-Got your job back.
-That's great. Thanks.

348
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,891
Pretty nice, huh?
Now who's a pushover?

349
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,688
-Rach, you're in my seat.
-I'm sorry.

350
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:27,330
I never heard who you'd pick
to be your girlfriend.

351
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:30,803
-I'd pick you, Phoebe.
-Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.

352
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,531
Yeah, I kind of thought.

353
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,646
-Never.
-It would totally be you.

354
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:44,009
If you had to pick one
of the other two to go out with. . .

355
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,651
. . .who would you pick?

356
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:47,206
-No way.
-I'm not answering.

357
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:48,885
Joey.

358
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:54,166
No way, I'm not answering that.

Okay, Rach, that's muffin
and espresso, $4.50.

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:09,724
Ross, double latte, $2.75.
Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25.

And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1 .25.

00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:15,052
All together that's $1 2.75.

00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:19,405
This coming from the man who couldn't
split our $80 phone bill in half.

6
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:22,850
How much do I owe you?

7
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:26,124
That's on the house,
courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

8
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,122
Great. Well, tell him thanks.

9
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:32,250
And since Joey seems like
such a nice guy. . .

10
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:33,925
. . .maybe we could go out?

11
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,600
He's not used to women
being so forward. . .

12
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:39,571
. . .but I could check with him.
He says it's okay.

13
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:43,524
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.

14
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:45,929
How come our stuff isn't free?

15
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:49,249
It will be when you look like
that in a tight skirt.

16
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,683
I'm getting more dates than ever.

17
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:54,725
You're only giving free stuff
to the pretty girls?

18
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,803
Joey, that is so gross!

19
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,767
How about a scone on the house, baby?

20
00:01:01,692 --> 00:01:02,807
I'm pretty.

-Hey, does anyone have any gum?
-I do.

24
00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:49,810
Here. Sorry.

25
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,404
Oh, you know what?

26
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:56,207
No.

27
00:01:57,652 --> 00:01:59,005
Wait a second.

28
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:07,885
-I know it's in here.
-You know what? I'm good.

29
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:11,807
Why are you here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

30
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,004
They sent me home.
They said I can't work if I'm sick.

31
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:18,328
-Sorry you're sick.
-I'm not sick!

32
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:24,410
I don't get sick. Getting sick is
for weaklings, it's for pansies.

33
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,648
No one thinks that you're a pansy. . .

34
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:30,531
. . .but we do think
that you need a tissue.

35
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:36,211
I have not been sick
in over three years.

36
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:39,121
I'll get tissue.

37
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:42,284
I don't need a tissue. I'm fine-d.

38
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:45,006
When you put a "D" at
the end of fine. . .

39
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,208
. . .you're not fine.

40
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:49,971
I'm fine-d.

41
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,008
I'm fine-d.

42
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,201
It's a really hard word to say.

43
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:11,489
-Yes?
-Hi. Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.

44
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,841
Oh, my God, Jill!

45
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:14,884
Oh, my God, Rachel!

46
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,848
Oh, my God, introduce us.

47
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:21,404
This is Chandler.
And you know Monica and Ross.

48
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:23,803
And that's Phoebe.
And that's Joey.

49
00:03:24,252 --> 00:03:25,731
-How you doing?
-Don't!

50
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,928
Honey, what are you doing here?

51
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,247
Which sister is this?

52
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:37,290
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

53
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:38,721
Daddy cut me off.

54
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:40,411
Never mind, I got it.

55
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,251
You know what I said?

56
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:45,802
I said, "I'll hire a lawyer,
sue you, take all your money. . .

57
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:47,411
. . .and cut you off! "

58
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,045
Wow. What did he say?

59
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,970
That he wouldn't pay
for my lawyer.

60
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:54,727
Then he told me to learn
the value of money. . .

61
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:57,406
. . .from the one daughter
he's actually proud of.

62
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,845
Did you hear that?
My dad's proud of me.

63
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,411
My dad's proud of me.

64
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,850
-Rach?
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.

65
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,289
Honey, so what did you do
that made dad cut you off?

66
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:11,645
Okay, I bought a boat.

67
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:13,245
You bought a boat?

68
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:15,848
It wasn't for me,
it was for a friend.

69
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:19,521
Boy, did we make friends
with the wrong sister.

70
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:24,844
This is the best thing that
could've happened to you.

71
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:27,128
You've needed to get out on your own.

72
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:31,206
When I did it, at first I
was scared, but then look at me now.

73
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:34,569
I am the only daughter
that Dad is proud of.

74
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,611
This is what you'll do.
You're gonna get a job.

75
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,442
You're gonna get an apartment.

76
00:04:41,652 --> 00:04:44,086
And you can stay with us.
Right, Pheebs?

77
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,202
Of course, yeah.

78
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:46,811
Oh, that's so great!

79
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:50,488
Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
I don't know how to thank you.

80
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:52,762
Oh, I like cars.

81
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,205
-You all finished?
-Yes.

82
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:01,811
Great.

83
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,807
Okay, here are the tips
for this morning.

84
00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:11,840
Jen gets 50, 50 for me
and Joey owes eight dollars.

85
00:05:13,372 --> 00:05:15,522
-What?
-For all the free food you gave away.

86
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,485
If it's free, how come
you're charging me for it?

87
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:22,491
Don't give anything away
unless it's a birthday.

88
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:26,084
What if they came in third
in a modeling contest?

89
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:28,241
No.

90
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:29,811
Sorry.

91
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,728
I just had the hardest day.
Some of these are so heavy.

92
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:41,083
How did you pay? I thought
your dad took your credit card.

93
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,760
I memorized those numbers
when I was 1 5.

94
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:48,010
But look at all the cool
make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!

95
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:51,050
This is my "Please, hire me" sweater.

96
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:55,171
And these are my "Don't you want to
rent me this apartment?" pants.

97
00:05:56,212 --> 00:06:00,763
Charging clothes to your dad doesn't
qualify as making it on your own.

98
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:04,004
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get
all technical.

99
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:07,326
Rachel's not gonna think
it's a good idea.

100
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:11,406
-So who made her queen of the world?
-I would love that job!

101
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,131
What's going on?

102
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:16,805
Jill!

103
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:19,125
Did you shop?

104
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,245
No.

105
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:22,607
They did.

106
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:25,810
Yeah, we went shopping!

107
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,611
You went shopping?

108
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:32,849
Then you came here
and paraded it under Jill's nose. . .

109
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,731
. . .when you know she's trying to quit.
That's terrible.

110
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,125
Sorry, Jill.

111
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,611
So what'd you get?

112
00:06:41,852 --> 00:06:44,047
Oh, well, all right. Thank you.

113
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:47,841
I got this, you know,
"I want a job" sweater.

114
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:53,804
And then I got. . . .
These are apartment pants.

115
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:56,801
Apartment pants?

116
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,605
You never heard of them?

117
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,489
Of course, I've heard of them.

118
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,405
Ross, what'd you get?

119
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,967
I got this. . . .

120
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:10,405
This.

121
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:15,171
-A Pashmina?
-Yeah!

122
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:19,411
I love these babies.

123
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:24,331
Really?

124
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,766
What's a Pashmina?

125
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:28,566
It's a rug.

126
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:31,681
Jill?

127
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,448
I'm sorry, Rachel.

128
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,042
You think that's gonna work on me?

129
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,203
I invented that.

130
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,480
Right! But I am sorry.

131
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,052
It's okay.
One little setback is okay.

132
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:49,163
But don't let it happen again, okay?

133
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,447
Okay.

134
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:54,804
Now, since Daddy paid for all this
stuff, I should take it all away.

135
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:58,084
But I'm just gonna take the Pashmina.

136
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,402
And the pants.

137
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:06,767
I'll take it all, because that way,
you'll learn the lesson.

138
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:08,801
Alrighty.

139
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:12,607
I'm gonna run a couple of errands
and I will see you at dinner.

140
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:17,649
She took all my stuff.

141
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:22,329
Yeah. Everything but
the little blue one.

142
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:23,800
That's the best one!

143
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:26,446
Oh, my God. Thank you so much!

144
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:28,444
Well, hey.

145
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:32,522
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
Like a Pashmina could be a rug.

146
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:36,281
Oh, yeah? How about you
with the "I'm sorry. "

147
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,562
Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.

148
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:42,765
What about what I said about
the apartment pants. How dumb was l?

149
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,925
-Were you this cute in high school?
-Oh, stop.

150
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:51,441
-No, you stop.
-No, you stop.

151
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,880
Why don't I sit here
and then you'll both stop it.

152
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,003
Okay, so what do you want to do?

153
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:02,444
Let's do something crazy.

154
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,604
I know, let's rest and drink
lots of fluids.

155
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,011
Okay, I'll rest.

156
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:12,524
But if I'm going to bed,
then you're coming with me.

157
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:17,807
See, that would be impossible to
resist if you weren't all. . .

158
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,371
. . .drippy here.

159
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:25,404
Are you saying that you don't
want to get with this?

160
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:32,809
I don't think you should say that
even when you're healthy.

161
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:37,205
Come on.

162
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,004
Don't take this personally.

163
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:43,851
I just can't have sex
with a sick person.

164
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:49,004
I'm with you. I can't have sex with
a sick person either. Disgusting!

165
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:50,247
But I'm not sick!

166
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,603
Let me prove it to you.

167
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:58,367
We are two healthy people
in the prime of life.

168
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:03,484
See, that's the thing, I would like
to stay in the "prime of lime. "

169
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:09,211
What's up?

170
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:12,122
I think there's something
you should know.

171
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,323
It better not be about
the apartment pants.

172
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:19,168
I just pitched the idea to my boss
at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.

173
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:22,008
No. It's just, I was. . . .

174
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:24,243
I was with Ross and Jill
after you left. . .

175
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:27,649
. . .and I'm pretty sure I saw
a little spark between them.

176
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,567
-What?
-I mean, it's probably nothing.

177
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:33,969
But I wanted to warn you
that there might be something.

178
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:36,124
-With Ross and Jill?
-Yeah.

179
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:38,524
With Ross and my sister?

180
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:44,563
With my sister Jill
and my ex-boyfriend Ross?

181
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,527
-Oh, there is no way.
-Okay, then.

182
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,610
Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!

183
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:55,005
I don't like it when he dates anyone,
but my sister?

184
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:57,168
Isn't that incest or something?

185
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:00,123
And they're gonna have sex.

186
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,411
Oh, no! What if he marries her too?

187
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:06,086
This is just terrible.
This is just terrible.

188
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,522
And I can't stop it.
I don't own Ross.

189
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:11,605
And Jill should be able to do
what she wants to do.

190
00:11:11,852 --> 00:11:15,606
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is
marrying my little sister.

191
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,969
This is the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me.

192
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:23,410
But great news about
the apartment pants, huh?

193
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,205
That'll be $3.85.

194
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:30,171
What? Yesterday you said
I was too pretty to pay.

195
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,809
It's just, I can't,
because my manager said that l--

196
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:38,409
Happy birthday to you

197
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:40,807
Happy birthday to you

198
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:43,810
-Happy birthday, dear Annie--
-Amy!

199
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:46,043
--Amy

200
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,442
Happy birthday to you

201
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:51,447
That's weird,
today's my birthday too.

202
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,404
Not in here it isn't.

203
00:11:56,852 --> 00:11:58,524
Sorry I'm late. What's up?

204
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:04,765
I just wanted to see if there were
any leads on the old job front.

205
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:07,930
No. But I walked past three sales
and didn't go in.

206
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,287
How strong am l?

207
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:12,126
That is great.

208
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:15,603
You know who doesn't have to
job-hunt? Ross.

209
00:12:15,852 --> 00:12:18,082
-He works at the university.
-Yeah?

210
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:22,007
So you guys talked? So you get along?
So you're gonna go out?

211
00:12:23,892 --> 00:12:26,406
Me go out with Ross? No.

212
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:29,007
God, no.
What would make you think that?

213
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:30,647
Phoebe. . .

214
00:12:30,892 --> 00:12:34,009
. . .said she thought she saw something
between you guys.

215
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,930
I mean, he's nice.

216
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,448
He's the kind you're friends with,
but not the kind you date.

217
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,162
He's the kind you date,
because you did. But me?

218
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,211
Not so much.

219
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:51,368
Oh, not so much? What do you mean?
ls there something wrong with Ross?

220
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:53,250
No, no, no. He's just. . . .

221
00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:56,290
I don't know.
You know, he's just a little bookish.

222
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,050
Are you saying he's a geek?

223
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,805
You think so too?

224
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:04,002
No. Ross is not a geek.

225
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,968
Then let's just say
he's not my type.

226
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,606
Handsome is not your type?

227
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:11,444
Smart, kind, good kisser.

228
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:13,808
What, those things aren't
on your list?

229
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,606
Ross is great.
You'd be lucky to be with him.

230
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,526
If it means that much,
then I'll ask him out.

231
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,201
Oh, no. That's not what I meant.

232
00:13:22,452 --> 00:13:24,124
You know what? You're right.

233
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:26,567
He has been really nice to me.

234
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,083
Yeah, but he's not your type.

235
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,211
But maybe that's good.

236
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:33,403
I'm doing all these different things.

237
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,405
Maybe I should just try
dating a geek too.

238
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:41,123
Yeah, but you don't want
to try too much too fast.

239
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:45,130
You remember what happened
to the little girl who. . .

240
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:47,363
. . .tried too much too fast, don't you?

241
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,007
What?

242
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:52,887
She died, Jill.

243
00:13:58,052 --> 00:13:59,610
Chandler!

244
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:05,048
What is it, honey?
You need some tea? Some soup?

245
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,650
Calling Dr. Big.

246
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:15,008
Dr. Big to the bed.

247
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:19,169
Geez, honey,
I thought you were asleep.

248
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:23,803
How could I be asleep knowing
that you were in the next room?

249
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:26,566
I was asleep.

250
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:34,003
No, honey. You know what's sexy?
Layers.

251
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:35,931
Layers are sexy.

252
00:14:36,172 --> 00:14:39,642
And blankets are sexy.
And hot water bottles are sexy.

253
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,360
Get into bed.
I want to prove I'm not sick.

254
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:46,168
I want to make you feel
as good as I feel.

255
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:49,768
Would you please get some rest?

256
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,610
I'm fine.

257
00:14:57,492 --> 00:15:00,006
Happy birthday to you

258
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:05,410
-You're paying for that.
-No, it's her birthday.

259
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:08,246
You've sung "Happy Birthday"
to 20 women today.

260
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:13,446
You are no longer authorized to
distribute birthday muffins.

261
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,605
Damn it!

262
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:22,887
Did you tell your sister
to ask me out?

263
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:27,521
-Well, yeah.
-Oh, wow! I mean, wow.

264
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:31,646
I think she's cute, but. . .

265
00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:34,964
. . .I never would've thought of
going out with her. Never!

266
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:36,567
Really?

267
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:39,002
But after your okay,
I figured, "Why not?"

268
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:42,886
Oh, so not really "never. "

269
00:15:43,772 --> 00:15:46,730
I have to say you are
a much bigger person than I am.

270
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:49,440
I mean, after all we've been through.

271
00:15:49,892 --> 00:15:52,042
I wish I had a brother
to reciprocate.

272
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:56,881
If you ever date Monica,
you have my blessing.

273
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,525
And mine.

274
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,361
Chandler?

275
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,843
I think I'm sick.

276
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,045
Really?

277
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:09,203
Struck down in the "pribe of libe. "

278
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:15,240
Okay, fine, I admit it.
I feel terrible.

279
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:17,801
Will you please rub this on my chest?

280
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,364
No, no, no.
You are not getting me this way.

281
00:16:23,092 --> 00:16:25,811
Come on, I really need your help here.

282
00:16:28,092 --> 00:16:31,004
-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
-Okay.

283
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:53,042
So you're just kind of
rubbing it on yourself?

284
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,645
-Yeah.
-It's nice.

285
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,567
You kidding me?
ls this turning you on?

286
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,205
Yes.

287
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:07,001
Is it the rubbing or the smell?

288
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:09,686
It's all very, very good.

289
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,683
So, you want to go. . .

290
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,805
. . .mix it up?

291
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:23,290
-Not now, I'm sick.
-Oh, come on, you big faker!

292
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:27,602
What about never sleeping
with sick people?

293
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:31,805
Well, that was before
all the vaporizing action.

294
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,923
Okay, if you really
want to have sex.

295
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,203
Worked like a charm.

296
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:47,401
Why are you here?

297
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:52,010
This is where Ross and I are meeting
for our date. So, what do you think?

298
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:54,641
I don't like it.

299
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:59,006
-Really?
-It's kind of slutty.

300
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,931
It's yours.

301
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:05,807
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.

302
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,561
Me too.

303
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,566
Hi, Jill.

304
00:18:13,772 --> 00:18:15,000
Hi. . . .

305
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:17,411
Rachel.

306
00:18:19,092 --> 00:18:22,402
You're not at home,
you're right here.

307
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:24,047
Yeah, I know.

308
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:28,285
And I bet you thought it would
be weird. But it's not.

309
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,811
Okay.

310
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:37,643
So, well, I'll. . . .

311
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,803
I'll have her home by midnight.

312
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:01,207
Why aren't you home yet?

313
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:03,408
Is someone there?

314
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,685
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.

315
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,009
What are you doing here?

316
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:13,011
I'm just looking out your window. . .

317
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,526
. . .at the view.

318
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:17,209
What are you guys doing?

319
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:21,204
We got some Vapor Rub in some places.

320
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:27,771
He brought her back to his apartment.

321
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:30,006
Who?

322
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:35,566
Is that your sister?

323
00:19:36,772 --> 00:19:39,002
She is a slut!

324
00:19:40,492 --> 00:19:43,370
Ross is on a date with your sister.
How weird is that?

325
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:46,007
Oh, my God, he's taking off
her clothes!

326
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:48,562
He's taking off her coat.

327
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:50,890
Oh, this is just terrible.

328
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:56,008
Oh, no, it's not. It's a first date.
I'm sure that nothing is gonna. . . .

329
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,203
He's gonna get some.

330
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:08,609
Of the glare. . .

331
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:11,642
. . .from the streetlight
out of his apartment.

332
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:15,607
You know, so he's closed
the drapes there. . .

333
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:18,485
. . .so he can have a nice, pleasant. . .

334

. . .conversation with
your little sister.

335
00:20:22,212 --> 00:20:23,725
Well, I'm off to bed.

Oh! Hey, Rach.

2
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:09,808
I was just coming over here to. . . .

3
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:13,210
Wait, I don't have to lie to you,
you don't live here anymore.

4
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:15,050
I'm eating their food.
You?

5
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:20,843
Ross is on a date with my sister.
They shut the drapes two hours ago.

6
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:23,606
I didn't know we could
date your sister.

7
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:29,164
We know you steal our food.

8
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:31,606
I'm good.

9
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:33,811
Drapes still closed?

10
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:37,488
Yeah. That perverted couple
two doors over should've shut theirs.

11
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:40,121
-Is that a swing?
-Oh, don't even ask.

12
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:46,167
I can't believe Ross
is with her sister.

13
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:49,165
When Chandler kissed my sister,
I was mad for 1 0 years.

14
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:53,009
-That was five years ago.
-You got five years left.

15
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:55,091
-Joey--
-Want to make it six?

00:01:34,932 --> 00:01:38,004
Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you?
There you are.

19
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:40,805
Can I get a cup of coffee?

20
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,806
So how was your big date last night?

21
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:48,328
It was okay. It was fun.

22
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:49,402
It was fun?

23
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:50,801
Great.

24
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:55,889
So did you guys hit it off?

25
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:59,404
I guess so.

26
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:03,727
So did anything happen?
Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes.

27
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:06,610
No. No. Nothing happened.

28
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:10,162
I shut the drapes to show her
slides of my favorite fossils.

29
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,482
Oh, slides!

30
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:18,201
So really nothing happened.

31
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,610
Something could've happened.

32
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,803
She really dug my slides.

33
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:26,641
And she was definitely
giving me the vibe.

34
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:31,244
Was it the "Please don't show me
another picture of a trilobite" vibe?

35
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,405
Anyway. . . .

36
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:36,645
If she wasn't into me,
why would she ask me out again?

37
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,082
-She asked you out again?
-Yeah.

38
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:41,088
Tomorrow night.

39
00:02:41,572 --> 00:02:45,360
Valentine's Day. The most romantic
day of the year.

40
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:47,204
Who knows what could happen.

41
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:50,922
I might not be shutting my drapes
to show her my slides.

42
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,651
Okay! I got it, I got it.

43
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:55,565
I can't go with the "you
and my sister" thing.

44
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:57,763
It's just too weird, all right?

45
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,128
I imagine the two of you together.

46
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,761
It just freaks me out.
I can't do it!

47
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:07,011
It's okay.

48
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:11,204
It's too weird for you.
I won't see her again.

49
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:12,248
Thank you.

50
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,845
After tomorrow night.

51
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,925
No! I can't do it.
It's gonna freak me out!

52
00:03:17,172 --> 00:03:18,605
Okay, okay, okay!

53
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:24,049
Okay. I'll tell her tonight
I can't see her anymore.

54
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:25,805
Ross, thanks.

55
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,645
Want me to call her now?

56
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,611
Oh, no. No, no, no.

57
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,732
No. Come on, I mean, that's crazy.

58
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:39,360
So, what's going on with you?

59
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:41,007
Well. . . .

60
00:03:41,252 --> 00:03:43,812
I may teach another class
this semester.

61
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:45,644
Do it now. Call her now.

62
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,722
-This is my favorite part.
-Me too.

63
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:58,210
You know what's sadder
than this? Bambi.

64
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:01,849
I cried for three days
with that movie. No, two.

65
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:06,131
The third day my mom killed herself,
so I was partly crying for that.

66
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:11,885
Well, that I can see crying
over, but Bambi is a cartoon.

67
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,764
You didn't cry
when Bambi's mother died?

68
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:17,408
Yes, it was very sad when the guy
stopped drawing the deer.

69
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:23,641
It's okay to cry. You don't
have to be macho all the time.

70
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:25,410
I'm not macho.

71
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:27,410
Yeah, you're right.

72
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,010
I don't know what I was thinking.

73
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:34,081
I just never really cried.
I'm not a crying kind of guy.

74
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:39,122
Come on, there's gotta be something
that gets you choked up. Like. . . .

75
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:41,567
What if you saw a three-legged puppy?

76
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:45,208
I'd be sad, sure.

77
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:46,925
But I wouldn't cry.

78
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:50,801
What if the puppy said,
"Help me, Chandler.

79
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:55,210
All the other puppies pick on me. "

80
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:59,289
Cry? I just found a talking puppy.
I'm rich!

81
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,648
I've got it. I have got it.

82
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:05,644
Pictures from your childhood.

83
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,008
This'll get you going good.

84
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:10,844
Oh, what's going on there?

85
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:12,889
Parents' Day. First grade.

86
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:16,602
That's me with the janitor, Martin.

87
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:19,612
-Where are your parents?
-They didn't want to come.

88
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:21,803
-Chandler!
-Poor thing.

89
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:24,008
That story doesn't make you cry?

90
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:27,204
No. Look, I don't cry.
It's not a big deal, okay?

91
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,647
No! It's not okay!

92
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:31,610
It's not okay at all!

93
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,086
You're dead inside!

94
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,051
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?

95
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,442
-Are you Phoebe Buffay?
-Yeah.

96
00:05:43,372 --> 00:05:45,886
Can I get your autograph?
I'm your biggest fan.

97
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:48,726
My biggest fan?
I've always wanted to meet you.

98
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,047
Sure. Yeah.

99
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,123
Wow. Wow, thanks a lot.

100
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,284
I just want to say
I think you're really talented.

101
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:59,131
You're just saying that
because you're my biggest fan.

102
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:03,365
Take good care of that guy.
He's a fan.

103
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,011
Bye.

104
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:12,208
So you saw me
on Days of Our Lives, huh?

105
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:16,202
You want me to do a little
Doctor Drake Ramoray for you?

106
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:22,247
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

107
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,847
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's
autograph.

108
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,810
Oh. You're Phoebe's fan.

109
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,010
Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.

110
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,322
Movies?

111
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:35,684
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.

112
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,086
I don't think so.

113
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:46,211
No, it was. She was in
Sex Toy Story Two...

114
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:48,649
...Lawrence of a Labia.

115
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,008
And I got her autograph.

116
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,011
The guys at the comic book store
won't believe this.

117
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,441
Gunther?

118
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:03,446
Don't let that guy in here anymore.
He said Phoebe's a porn star.

119
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:07,804
Well, I wouldn't call her a star,
but she's really good.

120
00:07:08,412 --> 00:07:10,926
You should check out
lnspect Her Gadget.

121
00:07:15,972 --> 00:07:17,246
-Hey.
-Hey.

122
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:21,565
Ross just totally blew me off,
and he didn't even tell me why.

123
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,530
Oh, well.

124
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:28,011
The best thing to do to get over a guy
is to start dating someone else.

125
00:07:28,252 --> 00:07:32,404
Oh! There is this great guy you
will just love at work, named Bob.

126
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:35,445
He's a real up-and-comer
in Human Resources.

127
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,967
Thanks, but I'm not gonna date
some random guy from your work.

128
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,442
Not random. Bob.

129
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:47,245
It's probably because I'm not
mature enough or smart enough. . . .

130
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:49,608
Maybe he doesn't
like the way I dress.

131
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:53,122
No, that can't be it.
It's gotta be the smart thing.

132
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:58,408
I'm so stupid. I'm just this, like,
incredibly pretty, stupid girl.

133
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,606
No, honey.

134
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:02,847
Okay.

135
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:06,402
Okay. You want to know why Ross
canceled the date?

136
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:08,410
Because I asked him to.

137
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:10,804
You asked him to?

138
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:13,606
-Why?
-Because you are my sister. . .

139
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:16,246
. . .and Ross and I have
this huge history.

140
00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:18,164
You want to go out with Ross?

141
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,168
No.

142
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:21,363
You don't want him,
but you don't want me to?

143
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:25,046
You know, Bob in Human Resources. . . .

144
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:29,411
I can't believe you did this!
You had me doubting how smart I was!

145
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,967
You had me doubting my fashion sense!

146
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,921
It's not that big a deal. Just
don't date Ross. There's other--

147
00:08:36,172 --> 00:08:38,606
You have no right
to tell me what to do.

148
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,401
I'm not telling you what to do.
I am telling you what not to do!

149
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,210
Why are you so jealous of me?

150
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:47,408
This is not about me being jealous.

151
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,530
It's about you being a brat,
wanting what you can't have.

152
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:52,046
Can't have?

153
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:55,250
Excuse me. The only thing
I can't have is dairy!

154
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:00,411
Well, you just blew your chances
at dating Bob!

155
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,483
-Who?
-With Human Resources!

156
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:08,448
Jealous of her? Who does she think
she is, Princess Caroline?

157
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:13,606
-You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
-Do I have my own castle?

158
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:16,407
Hey.

159
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,244
-Phoebe's not here, is she?
-No.

160
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:19,561
Did you get a movie?

161
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:28,207
Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,728
But I don't think it's the kind
you're gonna like.

163
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:37,091
Not more movies that'll have us
reaching for the tissues all night?

164
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:44,010
Sort of.

165
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:46,641
What's going on?

166
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:51,001
Phoebe's a porn star!

167
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,441
-What?
-Yeah!

168
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,603
What are you talking about?

169
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:59,689
"Phoebe Buffay in
Buffay The Vampire Layer. "

170
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,887
That's Phoebe.
Where did you get that?

171
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:06,407
At the adult video place on Bleecker.

172
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:11,123
And I saw Joey was about to go in,
so I ran in ahead of him. . .

173
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:14,603
. . .to surprise him.

174
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:18,811
Then I pretended that I didn't
know he was in there.

175
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,845
Wow. I mean,
I just can't believe this.

176
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,242
I mean, you think you know someone.

177
00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,643
Even Phoebe, who's always been
somewhat of a question mark.

178
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:33,843
This is so bizarre.

179
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,402
I guess it makes sense.
She had such a terrible childhood.

180
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:39,802
I had a bad childhood
and I don't do porn.

181
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:42,924
Yes, but you're dead inside.

182
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,569
I'd better take that back.

183
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,847
What, why? Why?

184
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,044
We can't watch it.
It's Phoebe.

185
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,605
We shouldn't watch this.

186
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,007
Absolutely not. That goes back.

187
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,649
-Maybe a bit.
-The first half?

188
00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,845
This is wrong, you guys!
Phoebe's our friend!

189
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,208
-I'm not gonna watch it.
-Yeah!

190
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:05,045
Good for you, Joe.

191
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:21,570
I thought I'd find you here,
Nosferatool.

192
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:26,801
Are you going to plunge
your stake into my dark places?

193
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:31,608
Actually, I was kind of hoping it
would be the other way around.

194
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:35,651
What's that on her ankle?

195
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,008
Her ankle is what you're watching?

196
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,401
Well, it's hard to tell.

197
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,482
God, if she would just stop moving.

198
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,088
She's just doing her job.

199
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:49,403
You sick bastards!

200
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:52,125
It's a tattoo.

201
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:54,408
That's weird. Phoebe doesn't--

202
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,568
Wait, that's Ursula!
That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula!

203
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:02,249
Wait, wait! I can watch that!
Rewind it! Rewind it!

204
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,200
Hey.

205
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:08,006
What's up? Oh, my God!
What am I doing?!

206
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:18,087
Hey, sweetie.

207
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,408
"Chicken Soup for the Soul"?

208
00:12:26,492 --> 00:12:28,528
There's no back to this couch.

209
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:32,249
You hate this kind of stuff.

210
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:34,289
I figured I'd give it a shot.

211
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:38,969
One of the stories may make me cry,
then you won't think I'm dead inside.

212
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:41,728
Oh, that's so sweet.

213
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:44,122
I don't care if you can't cry.
I love you.

214
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:48,206
Oh, that makes me feel so warm
in my hollow tin chest.

215
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:50,610
Stop it.

216
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:55,004
Seriously. We get married, I'm up
at the altar and I'm like this:

217
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:58,201
I won't care.

218
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,410
I know that you'll be feeling it
all in here.

219
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,446
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

220
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,648
And if we have a baby one day. . .

221
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:08,725
. . .and the doctor hands it to you
in the delivery room. . .

222
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,327
. . .and you don't cry, so what?

223
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:15,046
If we take him to college
and go home. . .

224
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:18,409
. . .and we see his empty room
for the first time. . .

225
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,603
. . .and you got nothing?

226
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,604
It won't matter to me.

227
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,011
Okay.

228
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:30,132
I won't worry
about this anymore then.

229
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,408
And then, you know, if I die. . .

230
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,481
. . .from a long illness. . .

231
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,609
. . .and you're writing my eulogy. . .

232
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:42,202
. . .and you open the desk drawer
and find a note from me that says:

233
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:45,210
"I will always be with you" . . .

234
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:49,804
. . .and you still can't shed
one tiny tear?

235
00:13:50,812 --> 00:13:52,882
I know you'll be
crying a river inside.

236
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,442
-I love you.
-What is wrong with you?!

237
00:13:58,492 --> 00:13:59,402
-What?
-What?

238
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:02,611
You can't shed a tear
for your dead wife?

239
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:04,564
I left you a note from the beyond!

240
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,645
-So you didn't mean any of that?
-No, you robot!

241
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:17,564
You damn kids! You ring my bell
one more time and I swear--

242
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:19,803
Oh, Jill!

243
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,645
That's a game I play
with the kids down the hall.

244
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:27,402
They've really taken a liking to me.

245
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:30,686
What's the matter?

246
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:33,970
Rachel and I had a big fight.
Can I come in?

247
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:37,284
I know we're not supposed
to see each other anymore.

248
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:40,928
I don't know anybody in this city
and I need somebody to talk to.

249
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,491
Sure. What happened?

250
00:14:42,732 --> 00:14:44,609
I don't want to talk about it.

251
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,005
Okay.

252
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,240
-You know what might cheer me up?
-What?

253
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,211
Seeing some more of your
super cool slides.

254
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:59,846
-Wow, really?
-Totally. I loved them.

255
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:03,528
You could finish telling me about
the different kinds of sand.

256
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:09,965
I'd love to. Wait right here, I'll go
get the projector and my notes.

257
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:12,407
Thanks. You're such a good friend.

258
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,286
Have you guys seen Jill?
I can't find her.

259
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:22,851
-No.
-Is Ross home?

260
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,890
Maybe I'll call him and see
if he's seen her--

261
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:35,447
Who is it?

262
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,330
It's Phoebe. . .

263
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:38,682
. . . "Phoebe! "

264
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:41,288
Hey!

265
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,851
Oh, God!

266
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:47,010
So you're making porn movies.

267
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,811
No, I'm not.

268
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:50,968
We're still rolling!

269
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:52,884
You're making one right now!

270
00:15:53,772 --> 00:15:54,887
Let's go, Phoebe.

271
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:56,804
And you're using my name.

272
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:58,844
Can I help you with something?

273
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:01,128
Phoebe, come on!

274
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:05,206
Look, I'm talking right now.
You mean her. Oh.

275
00:16:05,652 --> 00:16:08,610
You know, twin stuff is always
a real big seller.

276
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:10,001
What?

277
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,442
I could talk them into giving you. . .

278
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:14,841
. . .thirty dollars.

279
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:19,003
No! No way! No!

280
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:22,164
And stop using my name!
And shame on you!

281
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:25,051
And shame on all of you!
You're disgusting!

282
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:27,169
Especially you, with that!

283
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:33,011
The slides are almost ready.

284
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:34,648
Yeah.

285
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:37,008
I know what this is missing:

286
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,731
Alcohol.

287
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,004
There's wine in the kitchen.

288
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,401
Oh, great.

289
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:52,610
What is my sister doing there,
and why are the drapes shut?

290
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:56,809
Okay. Rach, calm down, okay?

291
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,725
She's really upset.
We're just talking.

292
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:03,203
She's making something happen
with you to get back at me.

293
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:06,205
That's the only reason
she could be here, huh?

294
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,524
It couldn't be that maybe
I'm a good listener. . .

295
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,889
. . .and I put on a great slide show?

296
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:20,207
Ross, I am telling you,
she is using you to get back at me.

297
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:25,003
I think I can take care of myself.
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

298
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,526
That was your sister, actually.

299
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:34,888
She thinks you're just using me.

300
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:36,522
So?

301
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,523
-Hey.
-Hey.

302
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,605
I just came from the company
Ursula works for.

303
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:50,412
Oh, no, not you too?

304
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:54,528
I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks.
There were a lot of them.

305
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:57,244
Nice!

306
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,847
And I won't have to
go back there anymore. . .

307
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:03,129
. . .because I gave them
my "correct address. "

308
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:08,487
Isn't it gonna bother you
that people think you're a porn star?

309
00:18:08,732 --> 00:18:11,007
Oh, no, I know how to handle it.

310
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:12,605
-Good.
-Yeah.

311
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,528
Trying to figure out how you know me?

312
00:18:16,772 --> 00:18:19,411
I'll give you a hint. From porn!

313
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:24,205
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend
watched me in a porno movie!

314
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:29,411
-See?
-Yeah.

315
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:34,201
Hey.

316
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,768
You may have been right about Jill.

317
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:38,809
I knew it! What happened?

318
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:40,881
She kissed me.

319
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:43,088
What? You kissed?

320
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,602
Maybe we should
give them some privacy. . . .

321
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:50,647
Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?

322
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:54,009
Doesn't sound like it.
It's easy not to kiss someone.

323
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:57,363
You just don't. Look at us
right now, not kissing!

324
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:01,809
Let me finish, okay?
She started kissing me. . .

325
00:19:02,012 --> 00:19:03,843
. . .and I didn't stop it.

326
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,730
I guess I just wasn't thinking.

327
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,850
Yeah. Let me give you
something to think about.

328
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:14,007
Hold on! But then I started
thinking and I stopped the kissing.

329
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:19,087
Thank you for taking your tongue out
of my sister's mouth to tell me that.

330
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:25,045
I realized if anything happened
with me and Jill. . .

331
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:28,409
. . .then nothing could ever
happen with us.

332
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:31,404
-What?
-No, I mean. . . .

333
00:19:31,652 --> 00:19:35,122
I don't know if anything
is ever going to happen with us. . .

334
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,408
. . .again, ever.

335
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:41,564
But I don't want to know
that it never could.

336
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:43,564
So I stopped it. . .

337
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,611
. . .and she got mad
and broke my projector.

338
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:55,600
Wow.

339
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,928
I don't even know what to say.

340
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,004
Thank you.

341
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:09,410
You're welcome.

342
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,564
My God, are you crying?

343
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:21,088
I just don't see why those two
can't work things out!

344
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:28,131
All right, I'm leaving.

345
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:31,808
I'm not spending one more day with
someone who's out to sabotage me.

346
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,081
That's you, Rachel.

347
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,201
Yeah, I got that.

348
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,008
And you! I throw myself at you. . .

349
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:40,772
. . .and you say no? How gay are you?

350
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:47,369
You take care, Jill.

351
00:20:47,892 --> 00:20:50,201
-Okay, see you.
-Bye-bye.

352
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,888
I can't believe Jill's gone.

353
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:59,001
I can't help it, I opened a gate!

3
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:50,465
So, honey. . .

4
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:53,696
. . .this threesome thing?

5
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,782
How are we even gonna find--?

6
00:00:57,026 --> 00:01:00,575
Actually, I'm making a list of women
I know who might be into this.

7
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:10,422
Boy.

8
00:01:12,626 --> 00:01:14,821
Someone's been
doin' their homework.

9
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:18,296
I know Gail Rosten
is in there twice. . .

10
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:19,694
. . .but she is so. . . .

11
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:21,703
Oh, I know.

12
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:27,295
You know, just talkin' about it
is gettin' me kind of. . . .

13
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,224
I know. Me too.

14
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:31,179
I think Ben's asleep.

15
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:38,662
You know, I think it'll be
better if we just save it.

16
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,936
Right. Save it.
I can do that.

17
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:55,816
How's it going?

18
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:59,422
I've got to get out of this bed.
I'm going crazy here! Crazy!

19
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,180
Here you go, sweetie.

20
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:04,383
What the hell is this, herbal tea?
I hate herbal tea.

21
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,537
Well, I put some honey in it.

22
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:14,341
-She doesn't know she was fired?
-No, the doctors say it may kill her.

23
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:16,576
What are you two girls
whispering about over there?

24
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,022
But I think we should tell her.

25
00:02:26,226 --> 00:02:28,376
I mean, it's just so realistic.

26
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:30,025
I know.

27
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:31,620
His name's Pat.

28
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,424
Pat the dog.

29
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:35,741
I get it!

30
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:44,495
Ready for a refill?

31
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,345
I probably shouldn't.

32
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,021
So I will!

33
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,181
-It's like it's raining.
-Pretty cool, huh?

34
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:59,577
But if you think a fish wouldn't get
sucked into the mechanism. . .

35
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,498
. . .well, you'd be wrong.

36
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:05,144
Can I use your bathroom?

37
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:06,659
It's right through there.

38
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,303
You know, I gotta tell you.

39
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,297
If someone told me a week ago. . .

40
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:16,816
. . .that I would be peeing
in Joey Tribbiani's apartment. . . .

41
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:18,465
Life's pretty great, isn't it?

42
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:23,103
I hope you're hungry.

43
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,257
We're starting with oysters.

44
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,460
You know what they say about oysters,
don't you?

45
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:30,625
They have parasites?

46
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:37,781
Some people say that oysters
are an aphrodisiac.

47
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,499
-What people?
-People.

48
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,338
People say it.

49
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:44,900
Come here.

50
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:49,215
So, oysters, huh?

51
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:53,500
Then we'll have a little
Middle Eastern couscous.

52
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,139
Something we can eat. . .

53
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:56,739
. . .with our hands.

54
00:03:57,466 --> 00:03:59,536
When we were studying
communicable diseases--

55
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,060
It's sensual.

56
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:05,295
Didn't know. Okay.

57
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,940
Sorry, it's the hospital.

58
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,462
The food looks great.
Save me some?

59
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:15,703
I can't promise anything.

60
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,977
We're really gonna do this?

61
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:29,781
Looks like it.

62
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:34,985
If this is too weird for you,
you can still back out--

63
00:04:35,306 --> 00:04:36,534
I got it!

64
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:43,374
Thank you so much for coming.

65
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,218
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

66
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:49,465
I'm Ross, by the way.

67
00:04:49,746 --> 00:04:50,735
Hello, Ross.

68
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:56,143
-I love what you've done with the space.
-Thank you so much.

69
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:01,098
How hot is this?!

70
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:09,217
I'm sorry you're here with me instead
of Roger.

71
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:10,421
Yeah, me too.

72
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:14,781
Well, I could make it seem like he's
here.

73
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:19,102
"Here's some little-known facts
about couscous:

74
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:22,582
They didn't add the second 'cous'
until 1 979. "

75
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,219
Stop it! That's not funny!

76
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,418
I'm sorry, okay?
It's just. . .

77
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,897
. . .tonight was supposed to be a big deal.

78
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:36,786
-What was tonight?
-You don't want to know.

79
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:41,140
What was tonight?

80
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:46,700
Tonight was going to be
my first time.

81
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,060
With Roger?

82
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,184
Not just with Roger?

83
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:53,415
Oh, my God.

84
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,539
All right, relax,
Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!

85
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:01,182
Four different women!

86
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,496
I've had sex way more times.

87
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:04,702
How many?

88
00:06:05,546 --> 00:06:06,535
Nine.

89
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,461
I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.

90
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,022
Good for you. You really think
Roger's the perfect guy?

91
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,180
No, but he's not a horrible guy.

92
00:06:18,786 --> 00:06:20,742
That's what I tell girls about me.

93
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:23,737
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!

94
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,621
No, you are sweet and wonderful. . .

95
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,424
. . .and it'll happen for you.

96
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:31,225
Oh, really? When?
Do you want to do it with me?

97
00:06:36,306 --> 00:06:37,341
I was kidding.

98
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:39,659
So was l.

99
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:49,297
You're such an amazing actor.

100
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:54,861
How do you know where
Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off. . .

101
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:57,416
. . .and Joey Tribbiani begins?

102
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:00,416
Well, with Dr. Drake. . .

103
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:03,501
. . .they always tell me what to say.

104
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:09,903
And with Joey, I pretty much have to
make it up on my own.

105
00:07:12,586 --> 00:07:13,621
Tell me something.

106
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:20,065
-I just fell right off the couch there.
-Yeah, you did.

107
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,706
Here you go.
Let me ask you a question.

108
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:27,658
When was the last time. . .

109
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:31,103
. . .someone told you
just how beautiful you are?

110
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:32,621
Wow.

111
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,983
I can't feel my hands.

112
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:38,184
Come on. Come here.

113
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:08,905
We can't do this.

114
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,299
Oyster?

115
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,942
If we did do this,
there'd be a lot of pressure on me.

116
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:22,179
Because you've waited a long time,
and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

117
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:24,302
But I have nothing to compare it to.

118
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,900
Even if you were horrible,
how would I know?

119
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,177
I do like that.

120
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:33,465
It's harder for me.
I have four women to compete with.

121
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:36,500
Well, if it helps,
there were only three.

122
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,184
So it'd just be for tonight?

123
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:42,622
Absolutely. It would just be one
friend helping out another friend.

124
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:45,096
Stop it. We're not doing this.

125
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:46,621
-Let's do it!
-No!

126
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,815
Okay!

127
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,342
Do you have any moves?

128
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,379
I have some moves.

129
00:08:59,426 --> 00:09:00,700
I have no moves.

130
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:04,214
Whatcha doing there?

131
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,745
-I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
-Yeah, forget it.

132
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,497
What if I turn out the lights?

133
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:24,263
That's the couch.

134
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:30,497
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,139
I know!

136
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,819
I'll tell you something.

137
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:38,301
We are gonna do that again!

138
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,300
Morning.

139
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:55,896
Oh, right.

140
00:09:57,706 --> 00:09:59,264
Oh, God.

141
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:04,019
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani
heard me throw up.

142
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:07,341
He actually saw you a little bit too.

143
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:12,302
Oh, God, we didn't. . .?

144
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,218
Not after seeing that.

145
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:20,221
God, I'm just a horrible person.

146
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,496
Well, why?

147
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,145
Because I'm married.

148
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:25,144
That's right, I'm a married woman.

149
00:10:25,306 --> 00:10:28,298
I came to a TV star's apartment
to have an affair.

150
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,218
That's ridiculous.

151
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,298
I'm not a "star. "

152
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,065
I'm just a regular famous actor.

153
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,703
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.

154
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:44,096
Rachel, will you stop saying that?

155
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:45,781
Hey, look.

156
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:49,815
Remember on the show
when Capri was dying?

157
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:52,376
-And she gave me--
-The ring from the cave.

158
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:02,705
Oh, my God!
They let you keep that stuff?

159
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:06,456
Sure. As long as they don't find out,
you can keep whatever you want.

160
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,940
And I want you to have it.

161
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:10,785
No, I couldn't.

162
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:12,664
Every time you look at it. . .

163
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:16,182
. . .I want you to remember
that you are a good person.

164
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,377
Now, you had the chance to cheat. . .

165
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:21,025
. . .and with me.

166
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:26,345
But you didn't.
And that's what this ring stands for.

167
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,218
But I thought that ring stood for
Capri's undying love for her brother.

168
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:32,104
Look, you want the ring or not?

169
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:40,102
Hey, look at you! You're up!

170
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,219
I thought I'd try to take a walk.

171
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:44,297
Will you pour me some water?
I'll be back soon.

172
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:47,101
You're not gonna call work, are you?

173
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,177
No. I've learned my lesson.

174
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,418
Let's go! Come on!
Move it!

175
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,385
Phoebe, come on!

176
00:11:57,626 --> 00:12:01,096
Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou.
Good luck with the gallbladder.

177
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:08,495
Hey, Joe. . .

178
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:11,104
. . .did you ever have a threesome?

179
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:18,659
Look, Ross. Carol's great, and I'm sure
you're a very attractive man, but. . . .

180
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,980
No. The reason I'm asking is that. . .

181
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,582
. . .I sort of had one last night.

182
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,179
You?

183
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:33,095
All right. So? Was it amazing?

184
00:12:33,266 --> 00:12:34,585
It was. . .

185
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,180
. . .okay.

186
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,896
Just okay? Did you do it right?

187
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:45,223
Look, it's just, did you ever
go to a party and think:

188
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:49,015
"Would anyone really miss me
if I weren't here?"

189
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:53,899
But still, Ross.

190
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:59,097
Your worst day with two women,
pretty much better than any other day.

191
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:06,221
It's just. . .

192
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:09,943
. . .my part seemed to be over
pretty quickly. . .

193
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:12,541
. . .and then there was
a lot of waiting around.

194
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,817
But you got to be with both of them.

195
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,704
Not really.

196
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:22,900
Just Carol.

197
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,944
-Not the other one?
-No, she kept kicking me away.

198
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:28,099
You don't want that.

199
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:31,777
At least you got to
see a lot of stuff.

200
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:34,779
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.

201
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,937
-You get a little bored?
-A little.

202
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,985
Made a snack.

203
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:46,697
-What'd you have?
-Just a sandwich.

204
00:13:46,946 --> 00:13:49,301
Turkey. A little mustard.

205
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,423
-Sounds good.
-It really was.

206
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:01,502
Let me tell you about this chick
I scored with last night.

207
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:04,182
Wait a minute, that was you.

208
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,820
Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!

209
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:12,784
So you want to do something tonight?

210
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,176
I can't.
Dr. Roger's coming over.

211
00:14:17,986 --> 00:14:19,180
Oh, right.

212
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,657
Because you're still seeing him,
and he's a good guy.

213
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:23,975
I remember a time. . . .

214
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:27,215
Are you okay?

215
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:28,654
Yeah, totally.

216
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:30,261
Totally. Are you?

217
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:32,224
Great. It's so amazing.

218
00:14:32,386 --> 00:14:35,583
Last time Dr. Roger came over,
I was so nervous.

219
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:39,534
But after being with you,
I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"

220
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:41,534
I bet he can.

221
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:45,142
"I don't have an appointment,
but I sure could use a physical. "

222
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,896
-You sure you're okay?
-Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

223
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:05,785
My God! Barry!

224
00:15:05,986 --> 00:15:08,500
You said you'd be away all weekend!

225
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:12,218
That's right! I'm sorry!
I am early!

226
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:14,377
Finish, please!

227
00:15:19,826 --> 00:15:22,704
Surprise! Look who's back!

228
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,660
Call security.

229
00:15:26,986 --> 00:15:29,500
Pheebs, didn't you get fired?

230
00:15:29,946 --> 00:15:31,265
I don't think so.

231
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,746
-What are you doing here?
-All better. Back to work.

232
00:15:37,906 --> 00:15:39,942
This clown from research
told me I was fired.

233
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,097
He should do his research, huh?

234
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,017
Well, you were fired.

235
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:50,535
I told that guy
who answered your phone.

236
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,296
I didn't get that message.
So this doesn't count.

237
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:55,058
Anyway, I'll be in my office.

238
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:57,781
Phoebe, you don't have an office.

239
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:00,144
I'll work right here.

240
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:02,661
This is good. Next to this plant.

241
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,424
You're in my office.

242
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,820
I've made a lot of cash for this
company. I am talking big bucks!

243
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:15,422
Pesos! Yen! Rubles!
You make one little mistake--

244
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:17,463
You lost 1 3 million dollars.

245
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:19,503
So now this is all about money?

246
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,662
You know, it's bad enough that. . . .

247
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:25,142
You have got to be kidding.

248
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:28,943
-Are you all right?
-I'm having another heart attack.

249
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:31,541
I'm having another heart attack!

250
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:33,458
Call 91 1 !

251
00:16:34,266 --> 00:16:35,142
Dumb-ass!

252
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,619
Pheebs, how's it going?

253
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:42,141
They fired me, and I'm having
a heart attack.

254
00:16:42,306 --> 00:16:43,864
Well, welcome back.

255
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:50,735
Is Joey Tribbiani here?

256
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,976
If you see him, please tell him
I'm looking for him. . .

257
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:59,297
. . .and that this time
I am not gonna throw up!

258
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,022
Are you okay?

259
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:03,665
Me? I'm great!

260
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:06,420
I'm fine! I'm so good!

261
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,103
But you know who's not great?

262
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:10,415
Men!

263
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,019
You're a man, right, Ross?

264
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:13,454
Sit down.

265
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,896
Let me ask you something.

266
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:21,174
Do wedding vows mean squat
to you people?

267
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:25,545
Why is it that the second
we go out of town. . .

268
00:17:25,706 --> 00:17:29,142
. . .bam, there you are in bed
with the neighbor's dog-walker?

269
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,224
We're sorry.

270
00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:39,941
No, seriously. Seriously. What has
happened to the sanctity of marriage?

271
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:44,860
-Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
-What are you, a detective?

272
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,860
I don't know what's going on
with you and your husband. . .

273
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:52,938
. . .and what is hopefully
an adult dog-walker.

274
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:57,977
Look, can I just say,
not all men are like that.

275
00:17:58,226 --> 00:18:01,423
There are men who'll do anything
to make their marriage work.

276
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:04,100
Men who will stand by and watch. . .

277
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:08,697
. . .as their wives engage in what can
only be described as a "twosome" . . .

278
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:12,177
. . .with some woman she barely knows
from the gym!

279
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,223
Who are these men?

280
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:17,702
Just men. A guy I know.

281
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:21,621
Well, you might want to tell him
it sounds like his wife. . .

282
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:23,305
. . .is gay.

283
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:25,265
She is not. . . .

284
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:31,983
She's gay.

285
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,145
Oh, my God.

286
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,016
She is so gay!

287
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,657
I can't believe this.

288
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,774
Good day for married people, huh?

289
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:53,217
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.

290
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:55,861
I'm sorry your wife is gay.

291
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,862
I guess women aren't that great either.

292
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,744
Try telling my wife that.

293
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,496
Okay to come in?

294
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,816
Come in, eat, whatever you want.

295
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:12,942
Dr. Roger got beeped again.

296
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:15,540
Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?

297
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:20,018
I'm the ruptured spleen.

298
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,420
Why would you do that?

299
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:25,656
Because you shouldn't be with him.

300
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:30,545
You should be with me.

301
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:33,816
Really?

302
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:37,376
When you were talking about Roger,
that was killing me.

303
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:40,015
Things like last night
don't just happen.

304
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:44,054
At least not to me. I mean,
with the other two women. . .

305
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,901
. . .in the morning, I couldn't wait
to go be with my friends.

306
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,704
But with you. . .

307
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:57,025
. . .I was, you know,
already with a friend.

308
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,420
You probably don't want
to go out with me.

309
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:05,261
I make too many jokes, I've never
been in a serious relationship. . .

310
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:07,735
. . .and I'm not technically a "doctor. "

311
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:17,822
There was just one woman,
wasn't there?

312
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,099
No, there were two.

313
00:20:20,346 --> 00:20:21,415
Including me?

314
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:32,542
It only takes two heart attacks
To finally make you see

315
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:36,745
One of them won 't do it
But the second will set you free

316
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:44,537
Tell all your hate and anger
It's time to say goodbye

317
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,936
And that is just what I will do

318
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:49,939
Soon as those bastards I worked for
Die!

Hey.

2
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:07,771
I just got my teacher evaluations.
Look what this student wrote.

3
00:00:07,972 --> 00:00:12,090
"I loved Dr. Geller's class.
Mind-blowing lectures.

4
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:17,201
Dr. Geller, you are definitely the
hottie of the Paleontology Department. "

00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:22,651
"Hotties of Paleontology. "
There's a big-selling calendar, eh?

6
00:00:24,132 --> 00:00:27,681
-Who wrote it?
-The evaluations are all anonymous.

7
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,848
-You still have their exams?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:34,170
You could just match the handwriting
and, boom, there's your admirer.

A hot girl's at stake,
and he becomes Rain Man.

10
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:44,126
Wait a minute. Why are we
so sure that this is a girl?

11
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:49,571
It's a girl!

12
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:52,050
Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?

13
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:55,489
Because I'm a teacher.
She's a student.

14
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:57,967
-It's against the rules?
-It's frowned upon.

15
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:01,284
-Besides, there's a big age difference.
-When you're 90--

16
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:05,684
I know, she'll be 80 and it won't
seem like such a big difference.

17
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:09,487
No, that's not what
I was gonna say at all.

18
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:15,808
When you're 90, you'll still have the
memory of being with a 20-year-old.

00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:58,640
Chandler, you know your college friend
who became a movie director?

22
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:02,248
Oh yeah, Dana Keystone.
She was in my movement class.

23
00:02:02,852 --> 00:02:07,721
-What's a movement class?
-He's pretending he didn't take mime.

24
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,962
She's directing a new AI Pacino movie.
You gotta get me an audition.

25
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,288
I haven't talked to her
in, like, 1 0 years.

26
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,290
Please, Chandler,
I would owe you so much.

27
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:21,564
You do owe me so much.
You owe me 3000--

28
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:25,287
Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing
the subject? What?

29
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:28,285
-Will you make the call?
-Okay, I'll try.

30
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:33,447
Thanks. Last auditions are Thursday,
so I gotta get in by Thursday.

31
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,286
Just remember Thursday.
Can you remember Thursday?

32
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:38,601
Yeah, so Tuesday?

33
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:41,208
Thursday!

34
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:47,042
Just think of it like this:
The third day. Monday, one day.

35
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,123
Tuesday, two day.

36
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:51,090
Wednesday. . . .
When, huh, what day?

37
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,845
Thursday!

38
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,521
The third day, okay?

39
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:58,165
-Thank you.
-Okay.

40
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:03,368
-I'm gonna check my messages.
-You thought of that in there?

41
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:06,251
Sure, nature called.
She wants to see who else did.

42
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:09,851
Hello?

43
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:12,881
Rachel.

44
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:15,407
Someone is in our apartment.
Call the cops!

45
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,045
You're on the phone!

46
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:20,480
-Oh, my God!
-What?

47
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,045
Oh, my God! Thank you!

48
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,408
Fire department put out
a fire at our place!

49
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:28,890
-Oh, my God! How bad was it?
-It was a fire, I'm guessing not good.

50
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:31,647
-Come on, we gotta go!
-Yeah, come on.

51
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:36,248
What are you smiling about?

52
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:40,884
The part I want to audition for is
a fireman. This is so meant to be!

53
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:52,323
You were very generous
with your grades this semester.

54
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,848
-Professor Geller?
-Yeah?

55
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:05,811
-I really enjoyed your class.
-Oh, thank you. Thanks very much.

56
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,368
I'm a little embarrassed about
calling you a "hottie. "

57
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:13,604
-That was you?
-Yeah.

58
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:17,407
I felt a little weird about it.
You're a teacher. I'm a student.

59
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,649
Want to go out sometime?

60
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,450
That's not the best idea.

61
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:28,440
Oh, because I was thinking,
the semester's over.

62
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:31,206
-You're not my teacher anymore.
-What time?

63
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:35,642
Oh, you know what? Forget it.

64
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,410
I see you already gave me an A.

65
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,765
-Gotcha.
-I'm kidding! God!

66
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:45,887
So seriously, what time?

67
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:53,083
Coming through. Coming through.
Oh! Hello. Hi.

68
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:55,444
Right. Coming through!

69
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:57,690
Okay. Well, it's not so bad.

70
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:01,049
Most of the damage
was contained in the bedrooms.

71
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,449
Hey, buddy, think I could borrow
your uniform this Thursday?

72
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:08,045
-Excuse me?
-Joey! He's working.

73
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,602
You would look good in that.

74
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,450
Oh, how bad is it?

75
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:15,051
It's bad, it's really bad.

76
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:20,042
The only thing that isn't burned is an
ax, which I do not remember buying.

77
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:22,882
-How's your room?
-Everything's ruined.

78
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,566
My bed, my clothes.
Look at my favorite sweater.

79
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:26,688
Isn't that mine?

80
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:30,120
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.

81
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:35,001
You won't be able to live here for
a while. You have a place to stay?

82
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:37,089
Oh! Wow!

83
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:40,290
Okay, look, pal. . .

84
00:05:40,732 --> 00:05:43,565
. . .I am not in the mood
to be hit on right now.

85
00:05:43,812 --> 00:05:46,770
But if you give me your number,
I'll call you sometime.

86
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:51,203
Yes, they can stay with us.

87
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:54,051
Do you know what
started the fire, Mr. Fireman?

88
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:57,248
Well, do either of you smoke?

89
00:05:57,452 --> 00:06:00,762
No, not usually. But yeah,
I could use one now. Thanks.

90
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:05,409
-Do you light candles, burn incense?
-Yes, I do all the time. I love them!

91
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:10,691
Oh, my God, I did it! It's me,
it's me! I burned down the house!

92
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:15,050
Okay, Phoebe, calm down.
There's no need to place blame. Okay?

93
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,442
I warned her about those candles.

94
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:23,964
It's great to catch up.
I can't believe how long it's been.

95
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:26,442
Hey, Chandler, is that. . .?

96
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:31,320
-Oh, that's great, good for you.
-So, is it. . .?

97
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:36,644
Okay. So, yeah, maybe
we can get together. . . .

98
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,324
Can you hold on for one second?

99
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:45,927
What?

100
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:48,168
Do you want to get a pizza later?

101
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,045
Hi, I'm back.

102
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:55,248
Yeah, that sounds great.
We'll do it then. Okay, bye.

103
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,928
When's my audition?
I know it's Thursday, but what time?

104
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,089
Hi. We didn't get to the audition.

105
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm taking her to coffee.
We'll do it then.

106
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,480
Now you're going on a date
with this girl?

107
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,648
I haven't talked to her in 1 0 years.

108
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:15,964
You can't just call up
and ask somebody for a favor.

109
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,931
There are rules, you know?
You gotta put in some time.

110
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,281
Right, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:23,842
-It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.
-We only went out once.

112
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:25,645
You dated her?!

113
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:28,245
Not once.

114
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:33,765
Why don't I just go out with an ex,
you know, and do Joey a favor?

115
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:37,089
You want to do Joey a favor?
Maybe you go out with Joey.

116
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:48,443
That's great. My friend Joey's
in the movie business.

117
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,327
You know who I ran into from school?
Howie.

118
00:07:51,932 --> 00:07:53,843
My friend's name is Joey.

119
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:56,687
Apparently, Howie's editing now.

120
00:07:56,932 --> 00:08:00,845
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me
if he can edit my new movie.

121
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:02,326
Can you believe that?

122
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:05,251
You know, I haven't spoken to him
in 1 0 years. . .

123
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,046
. . .and he asks me for a favor?

124
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,642
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.

125
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,687
No "How you doing?"

126
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:18,890
Man, I mean, not even
a cup of coffee first.

127
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,844
-The nerve, huh?
-Yeah.

128
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:22,326
Refill?

129
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:27,249
This is last-minute, so I want
to apologize for the mess.

130
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:28,248
Oh, who cares?

131
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:35,521
Oh, my God! It sure didn't look
this way when I lived here.

132
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,051
I know!

133
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:43,044
But there's only room for one, so one
of you will have to stay at Joey's.

134
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:48,086
Since the fire was kind of my fault,
you should get to stay here.

135
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:52,166
Hey, hey, now. This was no one's
fault. It was an accident.

136
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:54,767
It was my fault.
You should get the nice room.

137
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:55,808
Okay!

138
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:59,643
You're the first guest
at "Hotel Monica. "

139
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:00,841
Hotel Monica!

140
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:03,003
Just tell me how you like your eggs.

141
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:05,487
I thought I'd bring them
to you in bed.

142
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:08,007
-You've been through so much.
-I have.

143
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,450
This right here is where
I keep the pizza.

144
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:15,848
And that's where the napkin is.

145
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:19,883
-What's that smell?
-I know! I don't. . .?

146
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:27,444
Oh, please, it was such a big class.
You never even noticed me.

147
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:31,770
What? Of course I did.
You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson. "

148
00:09:32,012 --> 00:09:32,967
Who?

149
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:36,966
Oh. I had trouble remembering names,
so I came up with nicknames.

150
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:41,046
The guy on the other side of you
was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt. "

151
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:43,250
Oh, yeah.

152
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:48,844
-So did you have a nickname for me?
-No. No.

153
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:51,003
Yes, you did. What was it?

154
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:55,211
"Cutie McPretty. "

155
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:58,245
Oh, that's so sweet!

156
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:02,444
Listen, I gotta tell you,
I'm having a great time.

157
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:06,361
You said it might be weird,
the whole student/teacher thing?

158
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:09,285
And to be frank,
I thought it would be too.

159
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:11,727
But it's not.
I mean, it's not at all.

160
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,444
-Dr. Geller!
-Burt!

161
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,444
Did you sleep well last night?

162
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:23,488
-I did.
-Yeah?

163
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:27,048
Monica was so sweet.
She left a little mint on my pillow.

164
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:29,409
Know what Joey left on my pillow?

165
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:30,727
Gum.

166
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:36,447
-We determined the cause of the fire.
-I know. It was my candle, my candle!

167
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:41,280
No, there was an appliance left on.
It looks like a curling iron.

168
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:43,847
-I don't use a curling iron.
-Someone does.

169
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:47,801
Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
Straight, straight, straight.

170
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,451
-It could've been a hair-straightener.
-Oh.

171
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,648
This is where I keep the pizza.

172
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,841
And--
Hey, where'd the napkin go?

173
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:08,890
I wouldn't want my best guest
to strain her eyes.

174
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:10,850
Thanks, Monica.

175
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:14,167
-Does that smell bother you?
-From Joey's?

176
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,289
I can hardly smell it over here.

177
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:21,250
Well, you let me know if you can.
I can bake a pie to cover it.

178
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:25,085
-I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
-Okay.

179
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:30,247
Hello?

180
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:33,205
One minute, please.
It's the fire inspector.

181
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:36,850
Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.

182
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,368
Really?

183
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:42,247
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't
the hair-straightener. . .

184
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,124
. . .that started the fire.

185
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,642
No, no. It was the candles.

186
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:50,083
Yeah. It's very not good
leaving candles unattended.

187
00:11:50,332 --> 00:11:54,769
In fact, one of the first things
they teach you in fire school is. . .

188
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:01,002
. . .okay, well I have to go now.

189
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,651
We had such a great time.
She's incredible.

190
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:12,487
I thought the age difference might be
a problem, but it wasn't.

191
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,962
Elizabeth is very mature for her age.

192
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,330
A concept lost on some people.

193
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:24,090
It's okay to date a student?

194
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:28,046
Well, not really. Technically,
it's not against the rules.

195
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:32,086
But it's frowned upon, especially by
the professor we saw last night:

196
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,163
"Judgy Von Holier-than-thou. "

197
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:41,882
You don't want to get a reputation
as "Professor McNails-his-students. "

198
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:47,962
-Yeah. What should I do?
-Well, it seems pretty clear.

199
00:12:48,212 --> 00:12:51,284
What's more important?
What people think or how you feel?

200
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:54,842
-You gotta follow your heart.
-Joey, that's so sweet.

201
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,207
-Hi.
-Hey! So how'd it go with Dana?

202
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:05,961
Any reason I should leave a block
of time open? Say, Thursday?

203
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,448
-I couldn't do it.
-You couldn't do it?

204
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,007
I need more time.
We're going to dinner.

205
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:13,009
You're going out with her again?

206
00:13:14,732 --> 00:13:17,690
-Going out with who?
-Dana Keystone, from college.

207
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:20,452
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she. . .?

208
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:23,565
No, that was Dana Kaplan.

209
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,046
Oh.

210
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,126
-Joey, you didn't even know her!
-Yeah, whatever.

211
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:34,881
Great story again.

212
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:38,841
The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo!

213
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,685
You know, actually I should get going.

214
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:46,726
Oh, no, no, stay!
Because you should stay.

215
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:49,441
Wow.

216
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:52,451
Oh, I am really flattered.

217
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:56,884
But I just. . . .
I don't feel that way about you.

218
00:13:57,932 --> 00:13:59,445
Oh, no, no. That's not--

219
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:03,122
I'm sorry, Chandler.
You know, you're such a sweet guy. . .

220
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:05,402
. . .and I don't want to hurt you.

221
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,604
I wish I could do something
to make you feel better.

222
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:10,848
No-- Really?

223
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:12,606
Of course.

224
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,642
Well, it just hurts so bad, l. . . .

225
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:18,488
Oh, I'm sorry.

226
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,964
-Maybe there is one thing you can do.
-What? Anything. Anything.

227
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,843
Well, I mean, this is just
off the top of my head now.

228
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:30,646
But I have this friend--
This actor friend.

229
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:33,850
He would kill me if he knew
that I was doing this.

230
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:35,647
But. . .

231
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:41,967
. . .would it be possible for him to
audition for your movie on Thursday?

232
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:44,451
Absolutely.

233
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:45,841
But. . .

234
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:50,802
. . .you'd really feel better if your
friend could audition for my movie?

235
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:53,088
The heart wants what it wants. Bye.

236
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:02,407
Hey! How's it going?

237
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:05,524
Well, not much has changed
in the last five minutes.

238
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:07,809
Yes, it has. I made cookies!

239
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:10,845
I'm still full from your
homemade potato chips.

240
00:15:12,132 --> 00:15:15,966
But you should eat them now,
because they're hot from the oven.

241
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:17,248
Okay.

242
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:21,809
But not in here! Can't eat them
in bed, remember? No crummies!

243
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:25,084
Oh. Okay, I'll be out in a second.

244
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,247
Okay.

245
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:37,080
-What are you doing?
-This doesn't lock, does it?

246
00:15:42,932 --> 00:15:47,289
-Oh! Joey, I'm sorry.
-It's all right, don't worry about it.

247
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:49,847
But look!
That's gonna leave a stain.

248
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:53,448
Rach, hey, it's fine.
You're at Joey's.

249
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,642
-Really?
-Yeah, look.

250
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:01,841
Yeah.

251
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:05,051
-I've never lived like this before.
-I know.

252
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:11,645
Well, don't waste it.
I mean, it's still food.

253
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:20,246
What do you want to do now?
Want to get a drink?

254
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:21,447
I can't.

255
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:26,043
-Oh, you have some studying to do?
-No, I have some turning 21 to do.

256
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,565
You know, I remember when I was
in college, we used to--

257
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:38,044
-What are you doing?
-Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.

258
00:16:41,612 --> 00:16:43,648
Do you not want to be seen with me?

259
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:46,161
No, of course I do. Are they gone?

260
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:50,290
No, they're still here.
But I think I'm about to leave.

261
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:53,046
What? No, no, wait, wait--

262
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,888
You're right, this is stupid.
Who cares what people think?

263
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,043
I mean, we like each other, right?

264
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,049
There's nothing wrong with that.

265
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:03,041
Come on.

266
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,845
Burt. Lydia. Mel.

267
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:13,289
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi.

268
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,887
Aren't you in my popular culture
class?

269
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:18,441
That's right, Lydia.
Elizabeth is a student.

270
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:20,290
And we're dating.

271
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:23,490
And you may frown upon that but. . .

272
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:26,041
. . .we're not gonna hide it anymore.

273
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,643
You are so fired.

274
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:32,885
-What?
-They'll fire you.

275
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:35,521
You can't date her.
It's against the rules.

276
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:38,240
Really? It's not just frowned upon?

277
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:45,401
I love it at Joey's!

278
00:17:49,092 --> 00:17:50,366
-Nice!
-Thanks.

279
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:51,886
So, you busy Thursday?

280
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:56,843
Oh, very funny. Remember? My
audition was supposed to be Thursday.

281
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:03,165
You got me the audition?
Let's hug it up!

282
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:07,445
Okay, okay! What are you
gonna do to me if you get the part?

283
00:18:09,492 --> 00:18:10,641
-Hey.
-Hi.

284
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:13,241
Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.

285
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,689
I know they said the hair-straightener
started the fire.

286
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:18,843
But I think I'm partly at fault.

287
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:21,486
You see, I didn't tell you, but. . .

288
00:18:21,732 --> 00:18:24,246
. . .I had recently refilled
the tissues.

289
00:18:24,492 --> 00:18:27,086
And so, let's face it,
that's just kindling.

290
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:30,210
So I think it's fair that
I stay at Joey's.

291
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:33,051
No, no, no, this was my fault.

292
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:35,641
-Besides, I'm fine here.
-Okay.

293
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:38,651
-Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
-Really?

294
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:43,044
-She said something about crummies.
-No, no, no! I was so careful.

295
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:47,849
You have to switch with me.
Monica is driving me crazy.

296
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:51,840
That's right. All the ladies
want to stay at Joey's.

297
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,283
No, I don't want to switch.

298
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:58,046
Please! I can throw
wet paper towels here!

299
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:01,642
No, but at Monica's,
you can eat cookies over the sink.

300
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,681
I know. I'm sorry.

301
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:07,845
All right, fine.

302
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:12,848
This looks like so much fun.
God, what a mess.

303
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:21,485
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.

304
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:25,850
I can't date you or have
a hot plate in my office.

305
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:31,048
I can't believe we have
to stop seeing each other.

306
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,682
For what it's worth, I did appreciate
you standing up for me.

307
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,646
That felt really nice.

308
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,323
Kind of made me like you even more.

309
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:45,571
I know, I know. I really like
you too. But we can't date.

310
00:19:45,812 --> 00:19:48,087
It's against the rules.
It's forbidden.

311
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:50,047
Wow.

312
00:19:50,532 --> 00:19:51,328
What?

313
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:55,081
Just hearing you describe it
as "forbidden" . . .

314
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,850
. . .it's really hot.

315
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,051
Really?

316
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,251
Yeah.

317
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:07,444
Well, I don't care how hot it is,
it's wrong.

318
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:12,647
-Stop it.
-No, no. It's wrong.

319
00:20:13,052 --> 00:20:14,451
It's naughty.

320
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:16,847
It's. . .

321
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:19,045
. . .taboo.

322
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:20,608
Shut the book.

323
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:26,049
Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.

324
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:31,687
Hey.

325
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,041
Hey.

326
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:34,082
So?

327
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:35,647
So. . .?

328
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:38,082
It's Thursday! How was the audition?

329
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:42,331
It's-- Monday, one day. Tuesday,
two day. Wednesday, what day--

330
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:45,642
Oh!

00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:21,207
...roomie.

6
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,367
-Yeah, I guess we are roommates now.
-I know.

7
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:27,803
Now that you bring it up,
our fridge is broken.

8
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,291
We have to get a new one.

9
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:32,967
I checked around and your half is $400.
Thanks a lot.

10
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:36,168
I'm not paying for half of that.

11
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,806
I'm only staying here
until my apartment gets fixed.

12
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:43,408
Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge
just after I was born. Okay?

13
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:47,930
Now, I have never had a problem with it.
Then you show up and it breaks!

14
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,410
What does that tell ya?

15
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:55,488
That refrigerators don't live
as long as people?

16
00:00:57,732 --> 00:01:01,486
All right, you know that the ATM
only lets you take out $300 at a time, so...

17
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,682
...l'll take a check for the other $100.

18
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,485
You're jokin', right?

19
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,890
Of course I'm joking. I don't take checks.

20
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:13,804
Thank God, you're pretty.

21
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:19,123
The One with Joey's Fridge

22
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,281
English subtitles by Softitler

23
00:01:55,892 --> 00:01:58,725
Hi! Do you guys know any cute guys?

24
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:01,690
Well, of course, I do.
My good friend, Joey, over here.

25
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:08,292
I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.

26
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:13,721
There's a big charity ball this weekend
and Ralph Lauren bought a table...

27
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:15,006
...so I kind of have to go.

28
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:17,208
-What's the charity?
-I don't know.

29
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:20,728
Something, either trees or disease....

30
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:22,930
Ralph mumbles a lot.

31
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:27,685
-He mumbles when you're not attentive?
-Yeah. It's weird.

32
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,887
But the thing is, I need to find a date.

33
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,531
What type are you looking for?

34
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,406
Someone that has his own tux
or the ability to rent a tux.

35
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:39,325
So he has to be a male
who has at least $50.

36
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:41,366
So close.

37
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:44,650
-Hi, everybody!
-Hi, there.

38
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:47,366
-This is Elizabeth.
-Hi, Elizabeth.

39
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,324
I'm a student.

40
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:52,048
Isn't she cute? Nope.

41
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,884
This is none of my business,
but weren't you guys supposed to...

42
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:59,088
...not be seen in public together?

43
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,287
We're not together.

44
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:04,365
No. We're just two people who happen
to have run into each other here.

45
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,646
This is....

46
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:08,401
Oh, sly!

47
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,931
I really wanted to meet you guys,
but I have to run.

48
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:14,650
-I'll see ya later?
-Okay.

49
00:03:14,732 --> 00:03:16,484
-Bye, Ross.
-Bye. See you.

50
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:20,686
-Didn't mean to run into you like that, sir.
-That is quite all right, ma'am.

51
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:21,722
Bye.

52
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,286
So, why's she leaving? ls it a school night
and she has a lot of homework?

53
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:29,804
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
is due tomorrow.

54
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,448
Well, tell her "good luck" with that.

55
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,242
Anyone else? Bring 'em on.

56
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:40,049
-When's her birthday?
-I don't know, Rachel. Why?

57
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:44,171
Well, you know it's just been so long
since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.

58
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:47,968
-I like Elizabeth.
-Well, thanks.

59
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:52,409
In fact, I like her so much that you tell her
I want my cookies early this year.

60
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:55,042
A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.

61
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,803
Guys, give him a break.
Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?

62
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,245
Well, it's actually been great.

63
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:06,282
She's 20, so she's not looking for anything
too serious, which is perfect for me now.

64
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:09,330
Well, that is great.
And seriously, she seems very nice.

65
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:11,562
I know you guys like
giving me a hard time...

66
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,086
...but it means a lot to me
that you like her.

67
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,925
-Just knowing you guys are, like--
-Okay, I got a good one.

68
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,603
What is she, like 12?

69
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,444
Chandler, do you think we talk
about our relationship enough?

70
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:36,762
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?

71
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:40,408
Okay.

72
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:43,245
I just thought of the perfect guy
for Rachel to take.

73
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,368
That's so funny
'cause we found someone, too.

74
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,445
That's good. I guess she'll have a choice
between my guy and your weirdo.

75
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:53,522
-Why would our guy be a weirdo?
-'Cause that's just your taste.

76
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:57,730
See, Rachel's not gonna pick
your stupid guy.

77
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:58,921
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

78
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:02,004
My guy is a lawyer
who does volunteer work.

79
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:04,407
And, he has one of these.

80
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:07,121
A face ass?

81
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:09,486
A chin dimple.

82
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,923
Well, our guy works with Chandler.

83
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:15,203
And he's really nice and smart
and he's a great dresser.

84
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:19,285
-Have you seen your guy's body?
-No. Our guy's just a floating head.

85
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:24,008
Well, my guy is spectacular, okay?
He's a massage client.

86
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:28,688
And one time, when he was on the table,
I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.

87
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,442
-You're not supposed to look.
-Yeah, like there are police for that.

88
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:36,328
What, you look? You massaged me.

89
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:37,447
I know.

90
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,684
All right, your guy may have a great body,
but our guy...

91
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,000
...is really funny.

92
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:45,167
Chandler funny?

93
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:49,002
-Our guy's a great dancer.
-My guy's well-read.

94
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:51,447
-Our guy has great hair.
-My guy has great teeth.

95
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:53,807
Our guys smells incredible.

96
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,208
Do you want our guy to be your guy?

97
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:08,851
Well, you don't look good, Joe.

98
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:13,084
Well, the fridge broke,
so I had to eat everything.

99
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:16,367
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.

100
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:19,165
What was in that brown jar?

101
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:21,641
-That's still in there?
-Not anymore.

102
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:25,690
So, anyway, how do you want to pay me?

103
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,961
Is this a service you're providing me?

104
00:06:31,052 --> 00:06:34,761
No, for my new fridge. For our new fridge.

105
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:36,405
"Our" new fridge?

106
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:38,767
-I don't live here anymore.
-So what?

107
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:42,289
Look, okay, suppose we were
a divorced couple.

108
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:45,246
And I got custody of the kid. Right?

109
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:49,245
Now suppose the kid dies
and I gotta buy a new kid.

110
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:53,487
Okay.

111
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:56,843
Gimme $400!

112
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,331
Professor Geller?

113
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,803
Oh, a student I don't know.

114
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,806
I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment?

115
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:14,360
Yes, of course.
What would this be regarding?

116
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:16,124
Making out in your office.

117
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:20,805
Of course. Why don't we go inside.

118
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:31,243
-What?
-Doorknob.

119
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,321
Sorry.

120
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,568
I actually do need to talk to you.

121
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:36,767
Okay, what about?

122
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:39,241
-Spring vacation?
-Spring vacation?

123
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:42,803
Yeah, we have time off
and a lot of people are going on trips--

124
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:46,771
-Professor Geller.
-Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?

125
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:49,364
I'll be with you in one moment.

126
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:53,765
So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.

127
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:02,767
You don't understand. Elizabeth was
about to ask me to go on a trip with her.

128
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:05,531
Is that taking it slow?
I'm not ready for this, okay?

129
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:08,763
-What do I tell her?
-Tell her the truth. You're not ready.

130
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:11,491
I could do that.

131
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:16,088
-Well, what if she gets upset?
-Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.

132
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,446
Or, you could just, you know, you....

133
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,049
What the hell are you doing?

134
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:33,684
What the hell am I doin'?
You just broke my fridge!

135
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:37,684
What? How do you know it....

136
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:39,603
How do you know it's even broken?

137
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:42,206
You think I don't know
what breaks my fridge?

138
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,441
Excuse me!

139
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,291
Well, what do you know?

140
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:48,767
Broken!

141
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,649
That'll be $400.

142
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,641
Joey, I saw you push him.

143
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:58,451
You pushed him?

144
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:05,164
Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
That has been broken for a while.

145
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:10,327
Chandler, remember I told you
about our fridge?

146
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,604
I still haven't gotten the check
for your half yet.

147
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,170
Do not give him any money!

148
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,886
I'm not talkin' to you!
You broke my fridge!

149
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:30,768
-You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
-Yes. Please come in.

150
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:39,090
-Doorknob?
-Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

151
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,523
Actually, I wanted to finish
talking to you about spring vacation.

152
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:44,727
Good.

153
00:09:47,012 --> 00:09:48,127
Look, l....

154
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:55,127
I've been having a great time with you.

155
00:09:55,212 --> 00:10:00,161
And I just don't want us to move too fast
or put too much pressure on us.

156
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:04,164
So, I'm sorry, I just don't think
we should go away together yet.

157
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:05,571
It's too soon.

158
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:09,050
Ross, I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

159
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:13,571
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.

160
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:18,641
No.

161
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:23,401
I think you misunderstood
what I was saying.

162
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:25,367
What I meant was--

163
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:26,726
You are so adorable.

164
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:29,925
That. Let's talk about that.

165
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,486
-Hi.
-Hi.

166
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:36,324
How did it go with Elizabeth?

167
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:40,765
Fine. It was just a misunderstanding.
She didn't want me to go with her.

168
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:44,487
She just wanted to tell me that
she's going to Florida for spring vacation.

169
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:47,723
Wait, is she going for spring vacation
or spring break, wahoo?

170
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:51,600
What's the difference?

171
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,843
A spring vacation, you're doing nice things
with your grandparents.

172
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:57,532
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.

173
00:10:59,212 --> 00:11:02,204
You know what?
Not all spring breaks are like that.

174
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:05,210
-What did you do on yours?
-I went to Egypt with my dad.

175
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:10,249
I can see it now.
"Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo! "

176
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:15,608
I think Elizabeth is a little more serious
than: "Spring break, wahoo! "

177
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,562
All right? Come on, she's taking my class.

178
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,564
-And slept with the professor.
-I'm gonna call her.

179
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,210
You guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.

180
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,004
We just met at the newsstand. We both
grabbed for the last Field and Stream.

181
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:37,804
What? I read that.

182
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:41,690
-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
-Yes. Thank you.

183
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:48,009
-Rachel, what the hell is this?
-What?

184
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:51,880
You ask us to find you a guy and then
you come in here with a guy of your own.

185
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,087
You found me a guy?

186
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,801
Yes, we found you a really cute
and funny guy from Chandler's work.

187
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:00,168
Yeah, and I found you one, too,
who is not a weirdo.

188
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:04,285
You know what though, guys,
I really appreciate that...

189
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:06,932
...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian
to the charity.

190
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,924
Are you sure?
Because our guy smells incredible.

191
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,287
Would you stop it with that already?

192
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:15,372
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

193
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:19,449
So, Sebastian,
do you do any volunteer work?

194
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,843
-No, not really. Why?
-No reason.

195
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:25,368
It's just I know a single guy
who does care about other people.

196
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:27,685
Are you funny?

197
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,367
-Excuse me?
-What are you guys doing?

198
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,761
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

199
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,442
Look, I just wanted
to have coffee with Rachel.

200
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:39,568
Well, so do a lot of people.

201
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:43,600
-Actually, I gotta get going.
-But you--

202
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:47,090
-Give me a call sometime.
-But you didn't give me your number.

203
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:48,810
Okay, see you later.

204
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,129
Turns out he is kinda funny.

205
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,483
I cannot believe you guys!

206
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:01,803
He was really nice
and he just left because of you!

207
00:13:01,972 --> 00:13:05,009
Yeah, but, "Sebastian"?
What is that, a cat's name?

208
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,686
You know what I noticed, Rachel,
he scares easy.

209
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,926
Now, is that the kind of guy
you want to take to a ball?

210
00:13:12,012 --> 00:13:13,968
"Sebastian, would you like to dance?"

211
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:15,891
"Okay. I gotta go."

212
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,652
All right, guys stop it.
Rachel, we're very sorry.

213
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,292
That is a very insensitive thing
for us to do.

214
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:26,161
You know what? Let's make it up to you.
We've two great guys for you.

215
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,924
Yeah, what have you got to lose?

216
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:32,085
You might even end up with someone
really special. If you pick my guy.

217
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,806
-All right.
-Okay. So, you will meet our guys?

218
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,007
Yes, I'll meet 'em.

219
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,925
It doesn't matter which one you choose.
It's up to you.

220
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:41,968
Our guy is perfect.

221
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:46,650
Or you could go out with the guy
Phoebe deemed was unsuitable for herself.

222
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,881
Phoebe, there you are!
Okay, you broke my fridge.

223
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:51,564
You owe me $400.

224
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,889
-Okay, sure.
-Really?

225
00:13:56,332 --> 00:14:00,120
Technically, you owe me $600
for sending out happy thoughts...

226
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:02,203
...on your last 10 auditions.

227
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:07,721
Call it even?

228
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:10,607
Okay.

229
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:14,361
There you are.

230
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:16,170
So, what did Elizabeth say?

231
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,364
Turns out she is going to Daytona
for "spring break, wahoo! "

232
00:14:20,372 --> 00:14:24,445
That means wet T-shirt contests,
guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...

233
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,722
...waking up next to people
you don't even know.

234
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,087
She is gonna have a great time!

235
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:33,087
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

236
00:14:33,652 --> 00:14:37,201
-You know the hotels?
-I was there! Spring Break '81, wahoo!

237
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,323
In 1981, you were 13.

238
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,643
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts.
I had a blast.

239
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:47,521
You know who knows how to party?
Drunk college chicks.

240
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:51,563
Okay, she can't go.

241
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,691
You can't tell her not to go.
You just started dating.

242
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:57,764
-Then what am I supposed to do?
-Nothing. Just be cool with it.

243
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:00,924
What if she goes down there
and then sleeps with a bunch of guys?

244
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:03,401
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.

245
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:13,048
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.

246
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:16,488
Yeah, I've been working
so hard this semester.

247
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:19,086
I really need to go crazy,
blow off some steam.

248
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,287
Sure.

249
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:26,246
Look, I don't know if your plans
are finalized yet, but...

250
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:29,565
...l know another great way
to blow off steam.

251
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:32,490
-What?
-Are you into crafts at all?

252
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:35,845
Ross, are you okay?

253
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,809
Yeah. Of course I'm okay.

254
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:39,928
I'm just being supportive.

255
00:15:40,012 --> 00:15:42,890
Supportive of you and this whole trip...

256
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:45,770
...and what's this?

257
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,330
It's a bathing suit?

258
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:51,289
To wear in front of people?

259
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,846
Is that supportive?

260
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,041
Is this?

261
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:59,201
Okay, good.

262
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,361
-Hi.
-Hi.

263
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:04,365
We're so glad you decided to meet our guy.
You're gonna like him so much.

264
00:16:04,612 --> 00:16:07,285
-When do you want to meet him?
-I don't know.

265
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:10,250
-I don't work late tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow night is good.

266
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:14,251
But why put off something 'til tomorrow
when you can do it right now.

267
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:16,607
-Eldad, come here!
-What?

268
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:19,922
-Eldad, this is Rachel.
-How are you?

269
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:22,646
A little blind-sided, but, you know, good.

270
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,292
Eldad, sit down. Move over now.

271
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:28,804
There you go. There you are.

272
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:31,929
Okay, we can take a hint!

273
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,807
What? What are you doing here?

274
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:37,166
This is Patrick.

275
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,241
-Hi.
-Hi.

276
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,932
You're too late,
because she's already with our guy.

277
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:45,244
Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late.
They're sitting on the couch and talking.

278
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:46,927
Come on.

279
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,569
Rachel? This is Patrick.

280
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:52,601
-Hi.
-Hi.

281
00:16:52,732 --> 00:16:54,882
This is the guy I was telling you about.

282
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,487
Believe me, this suit does not do justice
to what's underneath it.

283
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:00,727
Okay.

284
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:05,045
But Pheebs, I'm just sort of
in the middle of something.

285
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:07,488
Okay. Have a seat.

286
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,528
-You can't do that!
-Maybe I should go.

287
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:12,643
Just sit down, we're winning.

288
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:16,082
Okay, you know what? Maybe I should go.

289
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,440
No. Have a seat!

290
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:20,126
Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.

291
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:23,325
-It is the softest hair. Touch it.
-I'm good.

292
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:26,927
Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
Give her some money.

293
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:31,841
Phoebe, this isn't really worth
the free massage.

294
00:17:31,932 --> 00:17:33,968
-That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.
-No.

295
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:37,169
Eldad is much more cooperative
and he can dance.

296
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:38,810
You dance for Rachel.

297
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:41,129
No, don't dance for me, please!

298
00:17:41,612 --> 00:17:43,682
What is the matter with you guys?

299
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,808
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.

300
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:49,331
Am I the only one
that this is embarrassing for?

301
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:51,209
I'm a little embarrassed.

302
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:57,325
I'll tell you who should be embarrassed.
It's you guys. This is ridiculous!

303
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,886
Thank you, but I do not need you
to get me a date.

304
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:02,725
-Then why did she ask us to help her--
-I am still talking!

305
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:05,610
Then you chase away
the one guy that I actually liked.

306
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:09,162
No offense to you guys.
Really, congratulations on...

307
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:10,805
...all the cash.

308
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:14,569
And you really do have very soft hair.

309
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:19,646
But I'd much rather go to the ball
by myself than go through more of this.

310
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:20,761
Goodbye.

311
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:26,727
Now, do you use some sort
of special conditioner on that hair?

312
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:28,046
Yes, papaya extract.

313
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:29,321
Thank you.

314
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:37,245
So, have a great time down there.

315
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:38,691
-I will.
-Yeah.

316
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:41,206
-Did you pack that bathing suit?
-Yeah.

317
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:44,125
It was pretty funny
when I hid it for a while.

318
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:48,601
Anyway.

319
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,362
I am worried about that bathing suit.

320
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,444
Not because it's revealing,
which I'm fine with.

321
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,682
No, I'm concerned about your health.

322
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:00,405
Sun exposure.

323
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:02,801
Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.

324
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,650
-It's SPF 30.
-All right.

325
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,764
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.

326
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:11,202
I mean, sometimes you get 30,
sometimes it's 4 and I swear...

327
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:13,442
...more often than not, it's just milk.

328
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,881
Ross, it's gonna be okay.

329
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:20,085
I'm not going down there
to hook up with a bunch of guys.

330
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:21,965
I really like you.

331
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:24,247
I like how things are going between us.

332
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:25,640
-Really?
-Yeah.

333
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:29,008
I'm just going down there to relax
and hang out with my friends.

334
00:19:29,652 --> 00:19:31,483
Okay. Cool.

335
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,440
Here they are!

336
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:46,840
Call me!

337
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:54,567
Rachel, we're sorry
for pushing those guys on you.

338
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,485
That's all right.
I ended up having a really good time.

339
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:01,690
The charity was a big success,
they raised a lot of money and awareness.

340
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,410
So, what was it for, anyway?

341
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:07,288
I wanna say a disease.

342
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:14,731
I just got this weird message from Ross.
He said to turn on MTV. I don't know.

343
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:22,001
Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!

344
00:20:31,932 --> 00:20:33,650
Professor Geller.

345
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,487
To be 13 again....

-No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.

10
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:36,524
I thought I was pretty good, too.

11
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:39,285
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.

12
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:43,042
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.

13
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:45,202
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.

14
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,565
Fine. I'll do it without you!

15
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,521
I don't need you or anybody else!

16
00:00:51,772 --> 00:00:53,922
I'm gonna make it on my own!

17

00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:04,441
English subtitles by Softitler

20
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:39,887
So, what's this thing
you're auditioning for?

21
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:41,690
It's a new TV show. Yeah.

22
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:45,003
I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac"!

23
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:51,005
I'm a detective and I solve crimes
with the help of my robot partner.

24
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,686
He's a computerized humanoid...

25
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:56,809
...electronically enhanced, secret enforcer.

26
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:58,729
Or, "C.H.E.E.S.E."

27
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:04,725
-So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-That's the title!

28
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,484
They really lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese."

29
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:11,411
That is lucky.

30
00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:15,201
So Joey, if you get this,
you're gonna be, like...

31
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,010
...the star of your own TV show.

32
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:21,404
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese"
or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!

33
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:25,049
Don't get your hopes up,
because it's probably not gonna happen.

34
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:26,850
Now, why would you say that, Joseph?

35
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,969
Well, I mean, come on you guys.
My own TV show?

36
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:32,725
-I don't know if I'm good enough.
-I am.

37
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:37,404
What are you talkin' about?
You're a terrific actor.

38
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:40,929
-You really think so?
-How can you even ask that question?

39
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:45,728
-She's pretty.
-Yeah. And she's really nice, too.

40
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:48,884
She taught me all about, you know,
how to work with cameras...

41
00:02:48,972 --> 00:02:50,928
...and "smell the fart" acting.

42
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:56,200
-I'm sorry. What, Joey?
-What? Excuse me?

43
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:59,364
It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...

44
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:02,603
...that sometimes you need a minute
to remember your next one.

45
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:07,447
So while you're thinkin' of it, you take
this big pause where you look all intense.

46
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:09,011
You know, like this.

47
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,367
Okay.

48
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:16,002
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

49
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:17,886
Mrs. Wallace?

50
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:20,566
I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

51
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,722
You sister is suffering from a....

52
00:03:27,692 --> 00:03:32,641
Well, Eva, we've done
some excellent work here.

53
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:39,081
And I would have to say
your problem is quite clear.

54
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:44,484
"All you want is a tinkle

55
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:47,447
"What you envy's a schwang

56
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:50,964
"A thing through which you can tinkle

57
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:54,011
"Or play with or simply let hang"

58
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:56,367
I play AI Pacino's butt.

59
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,401
All right?

60
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:02,723
He goes into the shower and then,
I'm his butt.

61
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:06,007
-Oh, my God.
-Come on, you guys.

62
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,164
This is a real movie and AI Pacino's in it,
and that's big!

63
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:13,245
No, it's terrific. You deserve this
after all your years of struggling...

64
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:16,768
...you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

65
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:23,565
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.

66
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:25,802
-No, you're right, it is.
-Yeah.

67
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:28,851
So, you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

68
00:04:30,932 --> 00:04:33,048
All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.

69
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:36,329
"Good luck, good luck
We all wish you good luck"

70
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:41,925
Yeah, whatever.

71
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:48,525
It's your turn.

72
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:51,204
Oh, are we playing this?

73
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:55,130
Hi. How did the audition go?

74
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:59,330
Terrible. I messed up every word.
I shouldn't even be an actor.

75
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:02,928
Wait. Are you doin' that thing
where you pretend it didn't go well...

76
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,889
...but it really did go well?

77
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:08,689
-Yeah, did I fool ya?
-Totally!

78
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:12,566
-So, it did go well?
-It went amazingly well!

79
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:13,846
-Great!
-That's great.

80
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,162
-It's down to me and two other guys.
-Oh, my God!

81
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,402
I know both of them,
and they're really good.

82
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:21,529
One's from those allergy commercials
who's always being chased...

83
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,445
-...by those big flowers.
-Oh, I love that guy!

84
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:27,402
What are you doing?

85
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:29,164
What am I doing?

86
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:34,561
I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback isn't 'til tomorrow at 5:00.

87
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,569
I feel like my head's gonna explode.

88
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,370
Well, it is overdue.

89
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,483
Don't worry, okay? You're gonna be fine.

90
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,369
Yeah, but it's so much pressure.

91
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:46,171
No offense, but what you guys all do
is very different.

92
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,884
I don't know if you'd understand.

93
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:51,209
Yeah, none of the rest of us
have to deal with pressure at our jobs.

94
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:56,082
Yes, I know what time it is, but I'm looking
at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.

95
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,488
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

96
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:02,561
-Is it dirty?
-No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.

97
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,722
Don't. I like it dirty.

98
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,845
That's your call.

99
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,250
So, what are you going to do next?

100
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,091
Well, I thought
that I would cut up the tomatoes.

101
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,083
Are they firm?

102
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:20,321
They're all right.

103
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:24,764
You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?

104
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:29,924
No, really. They're okay.

105
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,526
You gonna slice 'em up real nice?

106
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:35,212
Actually, I was gonna do them julienne.

107
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm out of here.

108
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:42,087
Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped
an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...

109
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:44,123
...and she didn't even buy it.

110
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:47,929
I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

111
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:50,048
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

112
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:53,242
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

113
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:54,811
Well, what happened?

114
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:58,885
Well, he came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until....

115
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:03,844
Oh, my God.

116
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:07,283
And all of a sudden,
his hands weren't the problem anymore.

117
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,049
-Was it?
-Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

118
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:18,131
You ate my sandwich.

119
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:20,891
It was a simple mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

120
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:21,961
Really?

121
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:25,044
Now calm down.

122
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:28,688
Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.

123
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:32,568
-What?
-Well, it was quite large.

124
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,961
I had to throw most of it away.

125
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:39,450
You threw my sandwich away?

126
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,169
My sandwich?

127
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:45,170
My sandwich!

128
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,126
It's just, I want this part so much,
you know?

129
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:53,331
If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat
macaroni and cheese again.

130
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:55,966
No, I didn't say that. That doesn't count.

131
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:02,844
Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.

132
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,888
I just moved across the hall.

133
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,202
And we would have you over all the time...

134
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:10,887
...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.

135
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:14,961
You're right, I could never lie to you.

136
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:16,405
She hates you.

137
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:20,011
Should I get that?

138
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:25,883
Hello? No, Joey's not here right now.

139
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,604
Can I take a message?

140
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:31,241
Yeah, okay. So the audition's been moved
from 5:00 to 2:30?

141
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,243
Okay, great. Bye.

142
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:45,602
-Aren't you dressed yet?
-Am I naked again?

143
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,527
We're supposed to meet my parents
in 15 minutes.

144
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,285
Okay. I was just talkin' to the guys.
Just look at 'em.

145
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,647
I mean, is it okay if they come visit?

146
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,167
What about my allergies?

147
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:59,925
Right. Your allergies.

148
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:04,008
All her. She hates you.

149
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,767
Yes! All right.

150
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:23,005
How cool would it be if you could watch
like a real life-size version of this?

151
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:26,329
-I mean, how crazy would that be?
-As crazy as soccer?

152
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,161
Hello?

153
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,643
What are you talkin' about?
The audition's not 'til 5:00.

154
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,129
Well, nobody told me.

155
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:43,205
Who'd you talk to?

156
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:48,687
Never mind.

157
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:52,126
You mean you didn't get it from this?

158
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:55,040
The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.

159
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:56,770
Maybe we can fix it, you know?

160
00:09:56,892 --> 00:10:00,407
Maybe we can send him
some big, big flowers and scare him!

161
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:02,565
How could you do this to me?

162
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:05,041
This part could've turned
my whole career around.

163
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:08,204
I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry. I really messed up.

164
00:10:08,292 --> 00:10:11,090
You don't even live here anymore.
Why'd you answer my phone?

165
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:13,606
-I have a machine!
-Which I bought for ya.

166
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,888
Taught ya how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.

167
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,925
If there was anything I could do,
I would do it, okay?

168
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:24,480
But everybody's allowed
one mistake, right?

169
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:26,370
He could have gotten me a VCR.

170
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:28,044
He could have gotten me golf clubs.

171
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:30,726
But no, he has to get me
the "Woman Repeller."

172
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:34,086
The eyesore from
the "Liberace House of Crap! "

173
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,888
-It's not that bad.
-Easy for you to say.

174
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,964
You don't have to sport a reject
from the "Mr. T" collection.

175
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:41,405
Chandler. Chandler.

176
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:44,689
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
I do! I do!

177
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,963
I pity the fool that....

178
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:52,201
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking and...

179
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:54,801
...one thing led to another and....

180
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,647
And what? Did you sleep with her?

181
00:10:57,732 --> 00:11:01,407
-No! No, I just kissed her.
-What? That's even worse!

182
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:05,285
-How is that worse?
-I don't know! But it's the same!

183
00:11:05,372 --> 00:11:08,523
You're right, I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

184
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,091
"Over the line?"

185
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:13,323
You're so far past the line
that you can't even see the line!

186
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,368
Yeah, the line is a dot to you!

187
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,686
I'm not saying that you should
magically forgive me.

188
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:22,447
But you're not perfect.
You've made some errors in judgment, too.

189
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:23,761
Name one!

190
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:26,691
What happened?

191
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:30,449
Man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

192
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:33,207
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in?

193
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,567
And where the hell's all of our stuff?

194
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:38,003
This guy came by to look at the unit...

195
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:41,402
...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

196
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:44,002
So you got in voluntarily?

197
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,367
I was tryin' to make a sale!

198
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:50,409
Man, if I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

199
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,641
Bend over?

200
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:54,241
There's Lori.

201
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:58,325
Okay, now remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

202
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,564
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey.

203
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:06,449
Well, well. Look what you brought.

204
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,410
And what did you bring?

205
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,163
She's checking her coat.

206
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:15,483
Joey, I'm gonna go wash
the cab smell off my hands.

207
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:19,082
Will you get me a white Zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice.

208
00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:24,967
Janice?

209
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:32,921
Oh, my God!

210
00:12:34,372 --> 00:12:36,886
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.

211
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,487
What?

212
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,882
No way. I've been goin'
to the guy for 12 years.

213
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,849
You said he was gonna do my inseam...

214
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:48,641
...then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite....

215
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:49,881
What?

216
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:51,681
Cupping.

217
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:57,361
That's how they do pants!

218
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,001
Ross, will you tell him?

219
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:03,880
-Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
-Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

220
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:08,406
I said name one!

221
00:13:15,372 --> 00:13:19,365
-I can't believe I did this. What an idiot!
-Stop beating yourself up.

222
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:22,046
People make mistakes.
These things happen.

223
00:13:23,612 --> 00:13:27,127
I hope there aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me, are there?

224
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:29,881
Apparently, you're not very good at it.

225
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,125
-Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
-Of course he will.

226
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,204
Chandler, the most important thing
is that you forgive yourself.

227
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:39,165
-You know what, I kind of have.
-Already?

228
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,562
That was pretty bad what you did.

229
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:44,043
You know what? He will forgive you.

230
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:48,529
I like to bring a pad with me when I go
answer the phone, just in case. Okay?

231
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,683
You didn't see how mad he was,
you know?

232
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:52,330
I'm sure he will forgive you.

233
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:55,324
Look, we've all been there, you know?
You fight, you make up.

234
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:56,527
That's the way it works.

235
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:59,805
It took two people to break up
this relationship!

236
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,962
Yeah! You and that girl from
the copy place...

237
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,725
...which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!

238
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:07,770
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

239
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:09,570
I didn't finish the whole letter.

240
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,165
-What?
-I fell asleep.

241
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,203
You fell asleep?

242
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:17,044
It was 5:30 in the morning.

243
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:21,688
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

244
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,810
Front and back!

245
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:31,762
And by the way?
Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."

246
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:34,042
Y-O-U-R means "your."

247
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:37,410
I can't believe I thought
of getting back together with you.

248
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,323
We are so over!

249
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:42,201
Fine by me!

250
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:47,049
And just so you know,
it's not that common...

251
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:50,369
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

252
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:53,285
I knew it!

253
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:56,209
You had no right to go out with him.

254
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,884
That is the most ridiculous--

255
00:14:57,972 --> 00:14:59,963
-You sold me out!
-I did not sell you out!

256
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:03,522
-Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me--
-Would you let me talk?

257
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:08,088
Did you just flick me?

258
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:11,851
Okay, well you wouldn't let me finish
and I was just--

259
00:15:11,932 --> 00:15:13,251
Stop it!

260
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:15,880
-Stop.
-Stop.

261
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:19,129
-All right. No, let's not do this.
-No!

262
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,168
-Happy thoughts.
-No!

263
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:25,323
-Happy thoughts.
-No!

264
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,722
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

265
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:40,691
All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.

266
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,164
-Fine.
-Fine.

267
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,211
There we go.

268
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:50,725
You know what? lf we were in prison,
you guys would be, like, my bitches.

269
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:00,608
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

270
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:04,881
You hide my clothes?
I'm wearin' everything you own.

271
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:07,204
Oh, my God!

272
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:11,566
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearin' any more clothes?

273
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:16,360
Maybe if I wasn't going "commando".

274
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:24,568
I tell ya, it's hot with all this stuff on.
I'd better not do any lunges.

275
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,849
"I think of all the friends I've known

276
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:39,844
"But when I dial the telephone

277
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,322
"Nobody's home

278
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:56,247
"All by myself

279
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:04,562
"Don't want to be
all by myself

280
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:07,090
"Anymore

281
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:11,290
"All by myself"

282
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,127
Joey?

283
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:20,682
Got you the Joey special! Two pizzas!

284
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:26,648
Hello? Damn it!

285
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:29,801
Hello?

286
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:33,767
No, Joey's not here right now,
but I can take a message. I think.

287
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,328
He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!

288
00:17:38,612 --> 00:17:42,287
Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.

289
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:46,164
Well, that's great.
I will give Joey the message. Thank you.

290
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:47,241
Yes!

291
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:49,601
Okay.

292
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,326
Mac...

293
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:53,610
...audition...

294
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:56,289
...at 2:00.

295
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:58,845
Allergy...

296
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:00,566
...actor...

297
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,205
...attacked.

298
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:10,247
By dog...

299
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:12,005
...not...

300
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,885
...flowers.

301
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:24,727
Please tell me you got the message.

302
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,406
-What message?
-The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.

303
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:31,246
-They needed to see you at 2:00.
-What? It's 6:00!

304
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:33,800
Look! I wrote it! I wrote it on the board!

305
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:36,531
I wrote it down,
then went lookin' all over for ya!

306
00:18:36,612 --> 00:18:38,489
I went to Ross's, the coffee house....

307
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:41,325
I went to any place
that they make sandwiches!

308
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:44,685
-I can't believe this, Chandler!
-I'm sorry.

309
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,050
I don't know what to say!

310
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:50,164
You might say, "Congratulations! "

311
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:53,927
I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!

312
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:57,451
Was that supposed to be funny?
I was worried over here.

313
00:18:57,532 --> 00:19:01,002
-I'm sorry.
-At times that fake-out thing is just mean.

314
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:04,050
Okay, man. I'm sorry.
I did not mean to make you feel bad.

315
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:05,451
Well, that's good.

316
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,763
Because ya didn't!
And I'm incredibly happy for ya!

317
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:10,846
That's mean!

318
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:15,126
-You had me goin' there!
-We could do this all day.

319
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:16,645
Yeah, you're right.

320
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:20,012
Look, let's talk about
what a huge star I'm gonna be.

321
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,322
You are gonna be a huge star!
I'm gonna hug ya!

322
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,084
-You hug me!
-All right.

323
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:28,843
"You've really got a hold on me

324
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:31,969
"You've really got a hold on me

325
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,451
"Baby!

326
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:41,488
"I love you

327
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:46,282
"And all I want you to do is just
Hold me

328
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:47,361
"Please

329
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,408
"Squeeze me, hold me"

330
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:54,691
-Do we do this too much?
-I think so.

331
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,769
-Yeah. Get off me.
-Yeah.

332
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,520
"Come on, C.H.E.E.S.E.,
I'm not leaving without you.

333
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:09,729
"Try routing your backup power source
through your primary CPU."

334
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:14,090
"I can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you! "

335
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:20,209
"Well, then I'll just have to carry you! "

336
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:22,403
"That'll be a neat trick...

337
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:24,964
"...when you're dead! "

338
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,650
Ross, you don't have to yell.

339
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:32,611
There was just an explosion, okay?
My hearing would be impaired.

340
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:35,330
I thought you were excellent.

341
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:38,410
In fact, for a minute there, I was like,
"Where did Ross go?"

342
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:43,047
Thank you. And I have to say
that first scene where you meet Mac....

343
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:45,083
-Yeah?
-Oh, my God. I mean....

344
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:46,521
And you know what?

345
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,604
I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.

346
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:54,127
-Holding us back.
-Totally.

-Okay, Chandler.
-Okay.

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:05,489
And your horoscope says:

00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:09,042
"On the 5th,
a special someone will give you a gift."

Well, thank you in advance.

"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."

6
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:16,920
You're going to make a joke
about my special present.

7
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,410
Why would you do that?

8
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:24,808
Wait. "On the 19th,
a secret crush announces itself."

9
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:31,566
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

10
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,849
Oh, my God! It's Joey Tribbiani
of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

11
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,648
That's right. It's your first day.

12
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:41,963
Are you psyched to fight fake crime
with your robot sidekick?

13
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:44,646
Am I psyched?
The lead in my own TV series?

14
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:46,842
I've dreamed about this for years!

15
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:49,408
Why have I not been preparing?

16
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:52,563
Joey, you're gonna be great.

17
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:56,446
But I gotta act with a robot.
I don't know anything about technology.

18
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:59,769
I can't even use Chandler's computer,
except to find porn.

19
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:03,604
And that's only because
it's there when you turn it on.

20
00:01:05,412 --> 00:01:08,290
Our lover's spat will start
a little early this month.

21
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:09,691
I'll be waiting.

English subtitles by Softitler

24
00:01:48,772 --> 00:01:53,050
Are you judging them by their covers?
Because you're really not supposed to.

25
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:57,322
I'm deciding which one to use.
I'm going to start writing another book.

26
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:01,246
Because the last one was such a big seller?

27
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:04,611
Well, if you must know,
I have written 14 books.

28
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,521
And as I'm the only one
who has read them...

29
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:11,002
...l can tell you that
they have all been very well received.

30
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,411
What are you doing later?

31
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:17,767
Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.

32
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:20,602
-We do?
-I want to see what he wants first.

33
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:24,772
I just found out Elizabeth's dad
wants to meet me.

34
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:26,729
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.

35
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,564
You're not Elizabeth's dad?

36
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:34,411
Come on, guys.
I really want this guy to like me.

37
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:38,485
It would really help me out if you guys
could be here to make me look good.

38
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:40,563
-Of course we'll help.
-Thanks.

39
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:44,289
We know how tough
those parent-teacher conferences can be.

40
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:52,123
-So, here's your office set.
-Wow!

41
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:56,802
Mac Machiavelli, Private lnvestigator.

42
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:00,281
Let's get you to wardrobe for a fitting.

43
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:02,044
When do I meet the robot?

44
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,766
Why don't we do that right now?
He's right here.

45
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,283
Joey Tribbiani, this is--

46
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,205
Wow! He's so lifelike.

47
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:12,601
Unbelievable.

48
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,048
This is Wayne, the man who created
and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.

49
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:18,004
How do you do there, buddy?

50
00:03:18,652 --> 00:03:20,882
I'll let you two guys get acquainted?

51
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:22,564
Sorry about that.

52
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:26,691
-So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
-C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.

53
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:34,124
Nice to meet you, Mac.

54
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:40,887
-This is the temporary robot, right?
-No. Why?

55
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:44,523
Well, I just thought it was gonna be
a really cool robot.

56
00:03:44,612 --> 00:03:47,126
Like the Terminator,
or when I first saw you.

57
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:52,365
I spent two years developing this machine.
It's absolutely state of the art.

58
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:55,364
Sorry. It doesn't look like
it can do anything.

59
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:57,000
It can do this.

60
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:12,681
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.

61
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:14,963
It's great to meet you, Paul.

62
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:18,528
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends address me
as Mr. Stevens.

63
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:22,130
Of course. Mr. Stevens.

64
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:23,841
So, Ross...

65
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:26,771
...what's your problem?

66
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:29,801
Excuse me?

67
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:32,201
Why can't you get a girlfriend
your own age?

68
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,284
It's funny....

69
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,440
It's not funny.

70
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:40,690
I don't like you going out
with my daughter, Ross.

71
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:43,650
Okay, I can see that.

72
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:48,164
I think if you give me one chance,
I can change your mind.

73
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:50,690
-Okay.
-What?

74
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,090
Okay. I'll give you one chance
to change my mind.

75
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:56,410
You've got one minute.

76
00:04:57,732 --> 00:05:01,008
-Daddy.
-Fine. Two minutes. Go.

77
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:08,170
A minute and 50 seconds.

78
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:13,247
I want you to know,
I have never done anything like this before.

79
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:16,483
I mean, I've been in relationships
in general.

80
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:19,684
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not....

81
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:24,085
Not "it." We haven't done "it."

82
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,683
I mean, we've done stuff....

83
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,889
Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood.

84
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:36,446
Two guys go into a bar.
One of them is lrish.

85
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:39,444
-I'm lrish.
-And the lrish guy wins the joke.

86
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:45,045
Ross! How crazy
that we would run into you.

87
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:47,170
Oh, my God! Thank you.

88
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:53,010
I 'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.

89
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,842
So you're Elizabeth's father?
I can see now where she gets her...

90
00:05:58,012 --> 00:05:59,650
...rugged handsomeness.

91
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:03,684
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?

92
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,765
There's a Mr. Bing!

93
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:12,567
Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away
shortly after she was born.

94
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:14,805
I raised her by myself.

95
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:17,565
I get that a lot.

96
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:22,086
Why don't we all take a seat?

97
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:25,403
I'll get us all some coffees.

98
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:27,211
Yeah, why don't you....

99
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:30,852
And you guys can talk about
whatever you want.

100
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,725
Whatever pops into your head.

101
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:38,205
It is so strange seeing Ross here,
this time of day...

102
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:41,011
...because usually
he's at the children's hospital.

103
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:44,090
But not looking for dates.

104
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,252
Monica is Ross' sister.

105
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,170
He's a great brother!

106
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:53,480
I had a sister.

107
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:55,531
She passed away.

108
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:58,202
You don't have to do that every time.

109
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:02,731
But Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.

110
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,160
Funny story....

111
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:08,046
Your roommate in college died, didn't he?

112
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,810
A part of him did, yes.

113
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:14,963
Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.

114
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:17,686
I hope you guys are finding
something to talk about.

115
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,728
-Yes. We were just--
-Sorry I'm late.

116
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:22,929
But I am ready to talk you up.

117
00:07:23,532 --> 00:07:25,170
When does Liz's father get here?

118
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:26,446
I'm already here.

119
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:28,523
Ross is so great!

120
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:35,767
Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.

121
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,002
You said we would get the kind
with the baby.

122
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:41,164
-You said the baby creeps you out.
-The little girl does.

123
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,766
-You said, "the baby."
-Why would the baby creep me out?

124
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:46,241
Why would the little girl creep you out?

125
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm sorry.
Can you please talk a little slower.

126
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:51,441
-This is for your book?
-It's about relationships.

127
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:54,126
You know, the traps, the pitfalls,
what not to do.

128
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:56,282
Keep going. This stuff's great.

129
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,081
Excuse me.

130
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:02,367
And how none of it matters
when the people really love each other.

131
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:08,364
And how people will believe anything
you tell them as long as it's a compliment.

132
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:16,084
-Oh, hi!
-Hi.

133
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:20,362
-I left my keys here somewhere.
-Well, let's look for them.

134
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,849
Hey, look! Are these them?

135
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:26,808
No.

136
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:29,361
All right.

137
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:33,245
-Here they are.
-Good.

138
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:35,209
-Thanks for your help.
-Wait! Sorry!

139
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,203
-Mr. Paul?
-Just call me Paul.

140
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:40,250
Paul. I just wanted you to know that...

141
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:42,567
...Ross really is a great guy.

142
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:46,565
Maybe you could date him then.
It would save me the trouble of killing him.

143
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,048
Are you okay?

144
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:55,090
You just don't look old enough
to have a 20-year-old daughter.

145
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:57,561
Well, we were very young
when we had her.

146
00:08:57,732 --> 00:08:58,528
We?

147
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:01,046
Yeah, it usually takes two people to....

148
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,046
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that!

149
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:07,721
What I meant was are you still "we"
or are you just you?

150
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:10,201
I'm just me.

151
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:13,486
My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.

152
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:16,968
So you raised her all on your own?

153
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:18,361
Yes, I did.

154
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:26,206
How was your first day?

155
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:29,364
Pretty good. Except I got
a little attitude from the robot.

156
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:32,967
Damn those robots. They're supposed
to be our faithful servants!

157
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:36,401
It was the guy who controls the robot.

158
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,962
He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
knock over the sandwich table...

159
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,168
...right when I was reaching for one.

160
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:43,970
Why don't you get him fired?

161
00:09:44,052 --> 00:09:47,488
I may have to. I hate to do it.
But I'm the star, you know?

162
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:51,288
There's a limit to how many sandwiches
I can eat off the floor.

163
00:09:52,732 --> 00:09:53,801
Excuse me.

164
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:56,440
Joey Tribbiani.

165
00:09:57,572 --> 00:10:01,008
Joe! I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.

166
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,122
The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.

167
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,887
The actor who has the part
doesn't know he might be fired.

168
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,044
It's the lead in a series.

169
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:11,690
Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

170
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,166
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

171
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:21,408
Joey?

172
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:24,727
Hi, Ross.

173
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,162
I was just getting him to like you.

174
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:39,087
Joey!

175
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,210
Ross, Joey is not here.

176
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:46,408
I'll just wait for him in here!

177
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:49,166
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.

178
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,209
Yeah. It's okay. It's me...

179
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,240
...Mr. Stevens.

180
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:58,327
I didn't.... Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.

181
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:02,089
You did. You came in, got all awkward
and ran to the bedroom.

182
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,844
You were shouting, "Joey! "

183
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:07,771
-Bye, Rachel.
-Bye.

184
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,001
I'll call you later.

185
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,525
-See ya!
-Bye, Ross.

186
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:16,968
What? What the.... How did.... What?

187
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:22,131
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.

188
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,406
In your mouth?

189
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:26,808
No!

190
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,608
Downstairs. And we got to talking...

191
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:33,526
...for two hours. I liked him.
I invited him for a cup of coffee.

192
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:36,042
You were at the coffee house!

193
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,521
What's the big deal? So I kissed the guy?

194
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:44,407
He's my girlfriend's father. It's weird!

195
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:48,042
-You dated my sister!
-That was different!

196
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:51,169
-What? Why?
-This is weird for me!

197
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,767
Ross, look. This is good for you.

198
00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:58,691
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving ya.

199
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:02,204
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.

200
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:05,684
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.

201
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,967
Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer!

202
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,566
-How is that important?
-It's important!

203
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:19,165
There's a million guys
out there who can play Mac...

204
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:20,605
...and there's only one robot.

205
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:24,287
And this one guy who controls it.
I didn't know he could get me fired.

206
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,521
What am I gonna do?

207
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,206
You're a pretty charming guy.

208
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,007
Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with.

209
00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:34,448
No, sweetie. You've got to win over
the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.

210
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:37,330
Go back there
and kiss some serious robot ass!

211
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,730
That's not a bad idea!

212
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:45,405
If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow,
I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.

213
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:48,322
I got some saved for you, Pheebs.

214
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:54,767
Do you think Joey is
more charming than me?

215
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
with him on the side.

216
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:58,527
You wish.

217
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:03,607
"You wish."

218
00:13:04,732 --> 00:13:06,051
Stop writing about us.

219
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:09,329
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.

220
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,842
-Who?
-Marsha and Chester.

221
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:18,331
Fine. Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.

222
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:22,848
-"Phyllis is sitting in the chair."
-I see what you're doing.

223
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,923
"Phyllis sees what I'm doing."

224
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:29,925
I have tasted my own medicine
and it is bitter!

225
00:13:36,652 --> 00:13:37,846
Morning!

226
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,852
How's my favorite genius
and his robot buddy?

227
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:43,002
-Don't touch him!
-Okay.

228
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,965
Level with me. I keep hearing
all these rumors that I might get fired.

229
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:52,164
They even have actors coming in
to read for my part.

230
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,051
Come on, man.
You gotta give me a second chance.

231
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:56,770
I love this little guy.

232
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:01,530
That's why you didn't want me
to touch him, right?

233
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:06,087
I can't believe this! God!

234
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,005
Hey, how are you doing?

235
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:18,883
So it seemed that my prom date
had stood me up.

236
00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:22,881
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.

237
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,005
What a nice story.

238
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,370
So Ross was in college...

239
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:31,320
...and decided to jump at the chance
to take a young girl to her prom.

240
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:36,884
I definitely did not see that one backfiring.

241
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:40,326
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Take your time.

242
00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:47,370
I was a freshman and she was a senior.
So it wasn't as bad as--

243
00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:50,405
Look. I know I've been giving you
a lot of jabs.

244
00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:54,649
It's partly because
I'm very protective of Lizzie...

245
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:58,722
...and partly because
they just keep coming to me.

246
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:05,046
I have to admit that after all
the wonderful things Lizzie has told me...

247
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:08,647
...and the many stories
that Rachel has told me...

248
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,121
...well...

249
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:14,851
...you're not...

250
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:17,087
...all bad.

251
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,646
"Not all bad."

252
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,683
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.

253
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:28,642
I still look at Lizzie
like she's a 12-year-old girl.

254
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:31,965
I know what you mean. I do that, too.

255
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:38,529
-I beg your pardon?
-I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.

256
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:42,811
I mean, I have a son who is six
and I still think of him as a baby.

257
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:43,802
You have a son?

258
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:47,880
My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.

259
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,251
Just so you know,
Carol and I are on excellent terms...

260
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,482
...as I'm sure you are with your wife.

261
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:54,881
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:56,212 --> 00:15:57,611
It's unbelievable!

263
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,045
Don't worry.
I just didn't realize you were married.

264
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,930
We were. But that was just a....

265
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:10,011
That was just a big drunken mistake.

266
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,361
You're back.

267
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:18,091
You two were married?

268
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,321
I'm sorry. You were talking about Emily.

269
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:27,365
We said we would meet
at the coffee house at 6:00.

270
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:28,880
We said 7:00.

271
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:30,526
We said 6:00!

272
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,609
The only way that I said 6:00...

273
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:36,765
...would be if I said the sentence,
"Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

274
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,685
If I had said 7:00, I would have said:

275
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:43,605
"My boyfriend is such a wiseass. 7:00! "

276
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,363
-Hi!
-Oh, my good God!

277
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:50,128
-I know what time you said.
-What?

278
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:53,284
Well, actually I know what time
Chester and Marsha said.

279
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:55,801
What time?

280
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:57,889
What an interesting turn of events.

281
00:16:57,972 --> 00:17:00,770
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
Let's see.

282
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:03,805
Very interesting.

283
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,522
Well this certainly clears things up.

284
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:08,687
What does it say?

285
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:12,082
I will tell you as soon as you thank me
for writing my book.

286
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:16,489
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book...

287
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:19,445
...and you are the queen of everything.

288
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,084
Thanks. So are you.

289
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,881
I told you I should not wear this color.

290
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:39,451
"Monica, Marsha and Chester are planning
on seeing a movie Sunday night.

291
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:43,726
"Marsha thinks they're meeting at 6:00.
Chester thinks it's 7:00."

292
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:48,124
-You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
-That's right.

293
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:51,841
Instead of telling us, you decided
to write it in your stupid book?

294
00:17:52,492 --> 00:17:55,325
"Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."

295
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,962
I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.

296
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:05,646
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?

297
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:08,644
Help me get this mini-fridge
past the security guard.

298
00:18:14,652 --> 00:18:16,722
Joey, I want to talk to you.

299
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,882
Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne.

300
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,928
I hate you. You ruined my life.

301
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:24,805
-Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
-Hi. How are you?

302
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:28,168
Joey, I'll get you your job back
if you help me out.

303
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:29,970
Why should I help you out?

304
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:33,370
-The reason he just said.
-What do you need?

305
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:38,848
I saw you on stage talking
to that beautiful woman.

306
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:42,163
You know, Sarah.
I wish I could talk to her.

307
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:44,563
-Are you in love with her?
-Yeah.

308
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,572
Her. All of them. Anyone.

309
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,722
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.

310
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:53,206
Listen, I guarantee you keep your job...

311
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,404
...if you can teach me how to talk
to women like you do.

312
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:01,402
It's not something you can teach.
It's something you're born with.

313
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:03,960
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.

314
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:07,169
Well, if you think about it...

315
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:10,005
...Ross did learn something
from each marriage.

316
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,927
How to make the next one even shorter?

317
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,924
Wait a minute. That's not fair.

318
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:18,084
He was married to me a hell of a lot longer
than he was to Emily.

319
00:19:18,172 --> 00:19:19,810
He just didn't tell me.

320
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:25,730
Maybe I have to pee again.

321
00:19:30,532 --> 00:19:31,931
Well, this is fun.

322
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:36,124
So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?

323
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:42,849
I have had enough of this!
I care a great deal about your daughter.

324
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,321
And I have treated her
with nothing but respect!

325
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:47,687
So if you've got a problem with me--

326
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:48,887
Are you yelling at me?

327
00:19:48,972 --> 00:19:50,007
God, no.

328
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:55,369
You know what, Daddy?
lf you don't like Ross, that's fine.

329
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:58,849
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm going to go out with him anyway.

330
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:00,481
Really?

331
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:03,322
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...

332
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,165
...it doesn't matter to me. Still not yelling.

333
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:11,280
What can I say?

334
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:16,404
This doesn't make me like you more.

335
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:19,802
That's okay. I'm not so crazy
about myself right now either.

336
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,486
-Then we agree?
-I guess so.

337
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:24,847
-Neither of us like Ross.
-I like Ross.

338
00:20:25,412 --> 00:20:26,288
Kids!

339
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:32,443
Wait. I just thought of another story
about how nice Ross is.

340
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,126
That's okay, Rach.
We're not liking Ross right now.

341
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,282
Well, I got a lot of those, too.

342
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,248
It turns out you were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.

343
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:47,688
-That shipment never made it to Omaha?
-You got it.

344
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:51,369
And the rabbi's beard?
100 percent horse hair.

345
00:20:52,012 --> 00:20:53,684
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.

346
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,443
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.

347
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:04,771
Wayne! Wayne!

1
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,526
Hi, you guys.

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:06,245
What's the matter?

3
00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:09,324
Well, it's just one
of these situations that I just hate.

4
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:12,006
You know,
a massage client gave me three tickets...

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,845
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.

6
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,400
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.

7
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:22,005
No, it's just that he gave me three tickets
and there are six of us.

8
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,162
-I'll give up my ticket.
-Me, too.

9
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,691
Okay. That's so generous.

10
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:28,967
And I think Ross is generous, too.

11
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,043
Great! Okay. Then it's just us girls.

12
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,531
-Great.
-Yeah.

13
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:36,330
So what is the exhibit?

14
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,846
It's mostly just photographs of...

15
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:43,928
...lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.

16
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:48,680
Oh, man!

17
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:54,410
-Hi.
-Hi.

18
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,681
Hey, Ross. Listen.

19
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,765
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.

20
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:05,842
Thanks? But I have plans.
Elizabeth and I are going out of town.

21
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:07,405
-That's great!
-Yeah.

22
00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:09,767
Think of all the money
that you're gonna make!

23
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:10,807
Why? What?

24
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,725
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?

25
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,970
No, no. That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.

26
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:19,963
You know, let it go. Stop it!

27
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:23,126
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father.

28
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:26,045
So he's much older than she is.

29
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:29,569
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils.

30
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,567
Ross, all that does is remind us
that you are interested in fossils.

31
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:38,406
Okay, okay.

32
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,207
Rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothings
in his ear.

33
00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:49,881
-Ross?
-Come on! That's funny, you know?

34
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:52,611
'Cause he's got like a hearing aid,
you know?

35
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,162
'Cause he's all old.

36
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:04,520
One second.

37
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,650
Okay, look, Ross.

38
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,606
So you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...

39
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,081
...l've accepted the fact
that you two are dating.

40
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,844
Really? Okay, that's great.

41
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:18,127
Yeah. But then I changed my mind.

42
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:20,210
I'm funny like that.

43
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:23,243
I told Lizzie and now I'm telling you.

44
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:25,800
I don't want you seeing
my daughter anymore.

45
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,201
All right, look. I realize it upsets you.

46
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,486
Yes, it does.

47
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,444
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...

48
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:38,121
...so I don't think there's really anything
you can do about it.

49
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:41,443
I'll inform the university
of your relationship, and have you fired.

50
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,329
A man with a plan!

51
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:49,564
The One Where Paul's The Man

52
00:02:49,732 --> 00:02:50,721
English subtitles by Softitler

53
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:27,520
This is so exciting. You get your picture
back up on the wall of fame.

54
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:30,046
I know.
It was so cool when it was up there before.

55
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:33,488
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.

56
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:37,089
Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.

57
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:39,049
Now he's just laughing at me.

58
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:42,645
Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard!

59
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:47,685
Okay. Maybe when they put your picture
back up...

60
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,848
...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.

61
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:52,321
Look at him just smiling at me.

62
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,601
Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.

63
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,808
-So I'm back.
-Who are you?

64
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,884
Joey Tribbiani.

65
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,291
From the wall?

66
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,201
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory.

67
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:16,567
Okay, anyway.

68
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:20,281
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.

69
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:24,729
-Show me in the TV book.
-Well, it's not on TV yet.

70
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:26,962
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.

71
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:30,920
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape.

72
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:35,890
So, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes here?

73
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,611
Maybe?
Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?

74
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:41,841
Fine.

75
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:47,491
I love museums.

76
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,881
-Soaking up all the culture.
-Yeah.

77
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:52,645
-Where do you want to start?
-The gift shop!

78
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:56,569
-And then lunch.
-Yes, but I can't eat too much.

79
00:04:56,652 --> 00:05:00,850
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.

80
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:04,124
What do you think?
Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?

81
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,725
What? No, why?

82
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:10,122
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?

83
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:14,601
You could put the aisle over here
and have the wedding ceremony here.

84
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:16,728
I didn't know you could get married here.

85
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:19,127
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.

86
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:22,682
But I wouldn't put the aisle there.
And I'd never have the ceremony there.

87
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:25,206
You'd have the ceremony
under this beautiful arch.

88
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,407
May I help you?

89
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,045
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's a beautiful space.

90
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:32,851
-Do you do a lot of weddings here?
-Yes, we're popular.

91
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,127
There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.

92
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:39,012
You should totally put
your name down for this place.

93
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:40,810
What? Are you crazy?

94
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:43,891
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.

95
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:47,123
There's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?

96
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,442
Then you've gotta wait another two years?

97
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:52,251
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

98
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,323
He's gonna find somebody else, you know?

99
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,801
Someone who did put their name
on the list.

100
00:05:57,932 --> 00:06:00,127
Yeah. It can't hurt to put your name down.

101
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:03,841
I mean, in two years, if you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.

102
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:07,009
Well, I guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.

103
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,525
I'm gonna do it, too.

104
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:09,647
Me, too!

105
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,725
Really? Who would you marry?

106
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:14,007
I don't know.
I don't have anyone right now.

107
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:15,161
Oh, Pheebs.

108
00:06:15,812 --> 00:06:19,168
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.

109
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,451
Phoebe, that's not--

110
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,648
Don't even get me started on yours.

111
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:30,610
-So, did you watch the tape of my show?
-I did.

112
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:34,731
-All right. Let's get me back up there.
-No. You don't go up on the wall.

113
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:39,525
-What? But you saw the show.
-Yes. It was very offensive to my people.

114
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,040
Dry cleaners?

115
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:48,524
Russians. It showed them
as terrorists and villains.

116
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:52,008
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!

117
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:54,407
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.

118
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,006
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring us nothing!

119
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:58,445
Okay, that may be true.

120
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:02,684
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil!

121
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:06,208
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.

122
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,486
I've never seen it.

123
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,244
You should. It's great!

124
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,246
This place is really beautiful.

125
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:21,240
Yeah. I've been coming here since I was
a kid. This used to be my grandma's.

126
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:24,483
The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes.

127
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:27,532
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.

128
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,371
But people say that my eyes look....

129
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,171
Do you want to make out?

130
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,241
Sure.

131
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:38,806
Are you okay?

132
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,441
What's wrong?

133
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:43,410
Yeah. I was just thinking
about your father.

134
00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,650
Well, whatever works for you.

135
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,721
No.

136
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:53,004
He just really freaked me out before.

137
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:57,049
So we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.

138
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:58,247
Big deal.

139
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,681
Besides, we've had fun hiding it.

140
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:01,921
Yeah.

141
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,480
-Yeah?
-You brought protection, right?

142
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,211
Why? Are there like bears or something?

143
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:19,242
Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.
That, that I forgot.

144
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:24,207
-I'll just run to the store and get some.
-No. I'm the guy. I'll get it.

145
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,886
-Do you know where the store is?
-No.

146
00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:30,362
Do you want to ride around town
on my little pink bicycle?

147
00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,126
A little bit.

148
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,364
-I'll be back in 10 minutes.
-Okay.

149
00:08:35,452 --> 00:08:38,524
Why don't you get in the hot tub
and I'll meet you there.

150
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:39,601
Okay.

151
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:57,205
Oh, my God! What a great surprise!
This is such a beautiful house!

152
00:08:57,292 --> 00:09:00,841
Thank you. It used to be my mother's.
This is the kitchen.

153
00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:09,690
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.

154
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:12,605
If you're listening to this message,
we're probably screening.

155
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:13,920
Yeah, we are.

156
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:17,926
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

157
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,923
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

158
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,843
There's been a cancellation.

159
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:26,005
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...

160
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:27,730
...it is available.

161
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:30,612
This is Chandler Bing!

162
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,401
Yes, the groom!

163
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:33,891
No, not the groom!

164
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:41,204
It's so secluded up here.

165
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:44,281
I know. That's why I like it here.

166
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:48,370
I feel like we're the only two people
in the world.

167
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:51,241
Sorry.

168
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,084
What's the matter, honey?

169
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,604
-Did you see a little mouse?
-No! Big bear! Big bear outside!

170
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:02,727
I think l....

171
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:05,042
Actually, would you go check on that?

172
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,363
Honey, we don't have any bears here.

173
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:08,726
Well, okay.

174
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,769
Would you get me a Diet Coke?

175
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:14,082
-Okay. Be right back.
-Okay.

176
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,646
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

177
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:24,963
-I came with Paul!
-Yeah. I recognized the ankles.

178
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:26,565
Hurry up. Get out.

179
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:29,011
Here you go, honey.

180
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,524
-Thank you!
-Diet Coke.

181
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:34,761
Ice.

182
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:36,845
I need ice.

183
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:39,681
Okay.

184
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,565
-Thank you.
-Be right back.

185
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:42,641
Okay.

186
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:45,445
You and your ice.

187
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,480
Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!

188
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:55,011
No, not in there! Not in there!
He's in there!

189
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:57,961
-Did you really hear a bear?
-Go!

190
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:02,565
Here you go, honey.

191
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:06,003
One Diet Coke with ice.

192
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:08,840
Thank you.

193
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:12,203
I am so happy that you're here.

194
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,089
-Here I am!
-Elizabeth!

195
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,329
Look! Elizabeth's here!

196
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:21,404
Who were you talking to?

197
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:23,286
You guys?

198
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,282
How did you know we were here?

199
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:32,361
Well, she obviously saw the tire tracks
that were leading up to the closed garage.

200
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,841
Obviously.

201
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:39,724
What are you doing here?

202
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:49,248
Did you come up here to work on
that term paper or something?

203
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:50,521
Yeah.

204
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:54,162
Well, why don't you go in that room
and do your homework?

205
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:57,528
I wouldn't do it in there.
That's my dad's bedroom.

206
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,882
That's your dad's bedroom.

207
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,562
That's your dad's bedroom!

208
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:10,011
Why are you yelling?

209
00:12:10,092 --> 00:12:12,765
That Diet Coke, I think,
went straight to my head!

210
00:12:18,092 --> 00:12:19,127
Hi, honey.

211
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,001
See you later.

212
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:24,726
Wait. I bought groceries.
I was gonna make you dinner.

213
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,325
Well, next time, ask!

214
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:31,448
Or at least wait for me to ask!

215
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:44,365
Hi, this is Hildy
from the Morgan Chase Museum.

216
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,284
I'm calling for Monica Geller.

217
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:47,361
Oh, no.

218
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:49,648
There's been a cancellation.

219
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:53,884
If she's still interested in having
the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...

220
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,200
...it is available.

221
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,044
Please. He didn't hear it!

222
00:12:57,132 --> 00:12:59,692
This is Chandler Bing!

223
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:02,361
No!

224
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:07,166
Can I help you?

225
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:11,042
Yeah. Where's the guy who decides
whose pictures go up on the wall?

226
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:14,124
-He's not here right now.
-You're kidding me!

227
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:18,285
Well, make sure you tell him that
Joey Tribbiani dropped off these clothes.

228
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:21,444
I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
my picture up there on the wall.

229
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:25,002
You know, there are two people
who could get your picture up there.

230
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:26,886
Oh, really?

231
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:31,090
Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.

232
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,043
You're the other one, right?

233
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:39,486
So, are you planning on staying the night?

234
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:42,882
No, no. Believe me,
I'm leaving as soon as possible.

235
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:47,851
Good. Not that we don't want you to stay.
Obviously, you're welcome.

236
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:50,002
How much more homework do you have?

237
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:54,681
I just have one problem left
that I do not know how to solve.

238
00:13:54,772 --> 00:13:58,367
Rachel, maybe you want to come upstairs
and help me figure it out?

239
00:13:58,452 --> 00:13:59,441
Really?

240
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:01,521
Okay.

241
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,530
Okay, I'll go upstairs...

242
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:07,363
...if you get me something from the car.

243
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:09,363
What do you need from the car?

244
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,085
Surprise me.

245
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:14,401
Okay.

246
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:18,443
So you're gonna be in the car!
I will be upstairs!

247
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,847
And that's where everybody's gonna be!

248
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:46,450
Just relax. Just relax, Paul.
You're doing great.

249
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:48,768
She likes you.

250
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,287
I think she likes you. She likes you.

251
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:55,122
You know why?
Because you're a neat guy.

252
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:59,044
You are the man.

253
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,688
You are the man!

254
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:07,080
Still got it.

255
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,366
Still sexy.

256
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,483
You're just a love machine.

257
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,643
"I'm just a love machine

258
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:20,162
"So proud of what you have, baby! "

259
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:30,400
Showtime.

260
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:34,604
"I'm just a love machine
Hey, baby! "

261
00:15:37,732 --> 00:15:38,721
-Phoebe?
-Yeah?

262
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,564
-Have you seen Chandler?
-No, why?

263
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:43,450
The museum called and said
that there was a cancellation...

264
00:15:43,532 --> 00:15:46,524
...and that we could move up our wedding.
And Chandler heard.

265
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,723
I know. How bad is this?

266
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:52,487
Well, with a regular guy it's bad.
With Chandler, oh, dear God!

267
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:57,409
I know! He totally freaked out
and I can't find him anywhere!

268
00:15:57,492 --> 00:16:00,643
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm never listening to you again, for sure.

269
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,451
"What harm can it do
to put your name down?"

270
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,371
-Rachel said that.
-Well, Rachel's not here!

271
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:15,771
Here it is!

272
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:19,132
Joey, why did you sign it, "son of a bitch"?

273
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:25,248
-I didn't do that. Who would've done that?
-Son of a bitch!

274
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,523
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.

275
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,804
You! Get out of my shop!

276
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:32,207
-What did he do?
-He went out with my wife!

277
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,281
Joey!

278
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:37,845
I did not go out with your wife! Okay?

279
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,445
I went out with her.

280
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,965
That's my wife!

281
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:42,641
Get out!

282
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,489
-Well, we should go.
-Yeah.

283
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:50,841
Ross?

284
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,126
Elizabeth!

285
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:03,288
Okay. I'm gonna go out this window.

286
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:07,048
I'll meet you at the front door.
Just tell them you're going home, okay?

287
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,805
-Okay.
-Wait, wait! No, don't go in there!

288
00:17:09,892 --> 00:17:12,360
Don't go in there! I need another soda!

289
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:14,481
Ross!

290
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:19,768
Oh, my God! What in heaven's name
are you doing here?

291
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:25,888
And that is why
we cannot see each other anymore.

292
00:17:28,972 --> 00:17:32,487
Ross, you and I are gonna have
to have a little talk.

293
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,846
-Daddy, l--
-You're next!

294
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:35,888
Okay. I didn't know he was here.

295
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,889
Let's see if I got this straight.

296
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:44,248
I tell you to stay away
from my daughter or I'll have you fired.

297
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,721
What you heard was: "Take my daughter...

298
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:49,849
"...come up to my country house
and ruin my weekend with Rachel."

299
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:54,403
-Okay. Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
-No! Let me explain! Fired!

300
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:58,412
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.

301
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,328
But, I want you to know...

302
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:06,328
...that you and I are not all that different.
I mean...

303
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:10,126
...l, too, am a "neat guy."

304
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,401
What?

305
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:24,051
And l, too...

306
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:26,688
...am "just a love machine."

307
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:52,290
-Let me show you where the guest room is.
-Okay.

308
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,690
I'm so sorry. Please stop freaking out.

309
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:08,165
I'm not freaking out.

310
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:11,691
Why would I freak out?

311
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:13,962
Hildy called and said
we were getting married.

312
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,849
But that happens every day.

313
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,886
Honey, we were at this beautiful place.

314
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:24,122
And I just put our names down for fun.

315
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:26,931
-I mean, what's the harm in that?
-Right here.

316
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:31,966
Please don't think I was trying
to pressure you.

317
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:34,361
-Phoebe and Rachel thought--
-Phoebe and Rachel?

318
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:37,808
So the people that knew
about our wedding before me were you...

319
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:42,363
...Phoebe, Rachel, Hildy, and some band
called, Star Light Magic Seven...

320
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:44,522
...who are available, by the way.

321
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:47,925
It was a mistake.

322
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:51,602
Please don't take this to mean anything,
because it doesn't.

323
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:55,327
Okay.

324
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,247
Really?

325
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:01,761
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
because I'm just not ready.

326
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:02,841
I know.

327
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:04,361
I know.

328
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:06,161
Okay.

329
00:20:07,052 --> 00:20:08,121
All right.

330
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,971
I'm gonna go tell Joey that you're back.

331
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:13,247
We were really worried about you.

332
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:20,090
Did she buy it?

333
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:21,727
Totally.

334
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:24,963
-So did Hildy show you the place?
-Yeah. It's beautiful.

335
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:29,091
I can't believe
you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.

336
00:20:29,172 --> 00:20:30,207
I know.

337
00:20:40,972 --> 00:20:43,486
-Hey, Gunther.
-Take these cappuccinos to table 1 1 .

338
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:46,086
And that guy over there wants
some biscotti.

339
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:49,922
Well, I just actually came in
for a cup of coffee to go.

340
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:52,810
Do you still work here?

341
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:56,560
No. I quit a long time ago.

342
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,800
Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.

343
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,170
-That's cool. I was gonna fire you anyway.
-Great!

00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:15,928
You're with Chandler,
who I really like.

5
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,003
You say he's straight,
I'll believe you.

6
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:23,767
After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
tell you I'd always regret it.

7
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:26,970
Letting you go was
the stupidest thing I ever did.

8
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:30,726
You're really not
supposed to be back here.

9
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:35,729
I'm sorry. I know this is
the wrong time and the wrong place. . .

10
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:37,684
. . .but I had to tell you.

11
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:40,601
I want to spend my life with you
and marry you.

12
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:44,051
I want to have kids with you.

13
00:00:48,012 --> 00:00:50,321
Why don't they put chairs back here?

14
00:00:51,812 --> 00:00:54,849
I know this is crazy,
but am I too late?

15
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:58,642
Yes, you're too late.
Where was all this three years ago?

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,167
I know. I was an idiot.

17
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,642
And I tried to forget you.
I really did.

18
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:08,488
After we had lunch last year, I spent
six months in Africa trying to forget.

19
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:11,924
-What were you doing in Africa?
-Working with blind kids.

20
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,527
What are you doing to me?

21
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:16,525
Look, l. . . .

22
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:20,162
I'm sorry,
but it's not gonna happen.

23
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:23,768
That's fine. I'll walk away.
And I'll never bother you again.

24
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:27,687
Only if you tell me Chandler's
willing to give you everything I am.

25
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:30,726
Well, he is. I mean. . .

26
00:01:30,932 --> 00:01:33,162
. . .marriage is all he talks about.

27
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:37,132
In fact, I'm the one
making him wait.

28
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:39,124
You are? Why?

29
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,526
Why?

30
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,329
Because of the government.

31
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,402
The One With The Proposal - Part 2

33
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:25,128
Isn't it incredible?

34
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,245
Monica and Chandler
are getting married.

35
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:31,404
I know. They'll be so happy together.

36
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,406
Two best friends in love.
How often does that happen?

37
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:36,529
-Not that often.
-No.

38
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:39,005
I'm so happy for them.

39
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:41,561
Me too. So happy for them.

40
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,521
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.

41
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:48,528
Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.

42
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:57,125
I'm probably 98% happy
and maybe 2% jealous.

43
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:58,845
What's 2%? That's nothing.

44
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,525
Totally.

45
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,441
-I'm like 90-1 0.
-Yeah. Me too.

46
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,123
Have you guys seen Chandler?

47
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:18,132
No. But you know who
was looking for you?

48
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,526
Tenille.

49
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:29,925
So that marriage stuff
you were saying yesterday?

50
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:32,600
-You don't really believe that.
-Sure, I do.

51
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:36,288
In fact, I think the whole concept
of marriage is unnatural.

52
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:40,122
Look at pigs. Let's take
a second here and look at pigs.

53
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,570
Pigs don't mate for life.

54
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:46,248
A pig can have 1 00 sexual partners
in a lifetime.

55
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,326
And that's just an ordinary pig,
not even a pig that's good at sports.

56
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:52,731
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,729
Are you telling me
you may never want to get married?

58
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:59,366
Never say never, but, probably. . .

59
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:00,965
. . .yeah, never.

60
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,126
Oh, my God.

61
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:06,045
Then what are we even doing?
What is this?

62
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,523
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is all this pressure?

63
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:11,764
Is this some new strategy?

64
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:15,561
Why don't you put down your copy
of The Rules, huh, man-trap?

65
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:18,923
You know what? I gotta go.

66
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,521
It's okay. I got a plan.

67
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:31,492
-We're gonna find love.
-Definitely.

68
00:04:33,012 --> 00:04:35,526
Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that.

69
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:40,131
That's what makes it so easy to be
80% happy for Monica and Chandler.

70
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:44,130
-Would be nice to have a guarantee.
-What do you mean?

71
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,522
Some people make deals with a friend.

72
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:51,163
Like if neither of them are married
by 40, they marry each other.

73
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:52,965
-You mean a backup?
-Exactly.

74
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:54,884
I've got that.

75
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,765
You do?

76
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,206
-Who?
-Joey?

77
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:02,250
Joey? Are you serious?

78
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:04,084
I locked him in years ago.

79
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:11,967
Wait. So if neither of you are
married by 40, you'll marry Joey?

80
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,850
Yep. We shook on it.

81
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:18,320
But believe me, that is not
how he wanted to seal the deal.

82
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:20,925
Seriously?

83
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:23,009
I think his exact words were. . . .

84
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:26,846
Charming.

85
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,728
He's just a backup.

86
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,721
Hey, Monica.

87
00:05:38,932 --> 00:05:41,048
Have you seen Rachel?
Or a mirror?

88
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,204
It's for my boat. Cool, huh?

89
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:46,046
Yeah, it's great.

90
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:48,681
What's the matter?
Talk to the captain.

91
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:53,843
Just realizing
I'm in a dead-end relationship.

92
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:55,730
He's giving you a hard time?

93
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:59,129
I don't want to get married tomorrow.
But I want to believe. . .

94
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:02,244
. . .we're going somewhere,
that I'm not wasting my time.

95
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:05,450
-You know Chandler.
-No, I don't know Chandler.

96
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:09,605
Not anymore.
It's like something's changed.

97
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:11,046
Maybe you changed.

98
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,291
I didn't change.

99
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,330
Maybe that's the problem.

100
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:19,731
-What?
-Chandler is a complex fellow.

101
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,532
One who is unlikely to take a wife.

102
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:28,449
Does he think I'll just
wait around for nothing?

103
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,570
Face it.
Chandler is against marriage.

104
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:33,723
And always will be.

105
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:37,531
Well, there's some people
who do want to marry me.

106
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,087
-There are?
-Yeah. Richard.

107
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,369
Richard said he wants to marry you?

108
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:46,885
-And Chandler says he hates marriage?
-That's right.

109
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,603
Chandler loves marriage!

110
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,848
You just told me he hates marriage!

111
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:57,448
That he's a complex fellow
who's unlikely to take a wife!

112
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:00,126
That he's against marriage
and always will be!

113
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:02,642
You got that from what I said?

114
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:11,921
-Rach.
-Hey, you.

115
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:14,925
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

116
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:18,245
I'm so sorry
to hear about you and Elizabeth.

117
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:22,326
Thanks. Yeah, I really thought
we'd be able to make it work.

118
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,563
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

119
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,291
Yeah. Love.

120
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:29,128
It's a tricky business, isn't it?

121
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:31,406
I guess so.

122
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:33,962
So what do you say we make a pact?

123
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:37,568
If you and I are both single by 40,
we get married.

124
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:40,724
I mean, we know each other,
we like each other. . .

125
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:44,760
. . .we've already slept together,
so there'll be no surprises there.

126
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,650
No, like, "What's that?"

127
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:53,885
-Oh, you want me to be your backup.
-Exactly.

128
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,123
Yeah. I already have one.

129
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:58,806
-Who?
-Phoebe.

130
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,246
Phoebe?

131
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:03,731
But she just said Joey is her backup.

132
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:06,122
Oh, I don't think so.

133
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:10,521
I just spoke with her. She said
that she and Joey made a deal.

134
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,570
That's impossible.
We have had a deal for years.

135
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,165
We shook on it.

136
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,722
Although, believe me,
she wanted to do a lot more than that.

137
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:24,126
Where have you been?

138
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,890
I was making a coconut phone
with the Professor.

139
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:32,605
Richard told Monica
he wants to marry her.

140
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,769
-What?
-I've been looking for you.

141
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,331
Stop messing with her!

142
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:40,167
And I would have if these damn
boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!

143
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,848
-Oh, my God!
-I know! They suck!

144
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,770
He's not supposed to ask her
to marry him! I am!

145
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:48,331
-I know!
-What--?

146
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:52,127
You know what I'll do?
I'll go over there and kick his ass!

147
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,925
Will you help me?

148
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:58,565
Look, us getting our asses kicked
is not a solution.

149
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:04,003
-Look, just go and find Monica.
-You're right.

150
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:06,369
I'm gonna get the ring. . .

151
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,965
. . .I'll go find her. . .

152
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:09,566
. . .and I'll propose!

153
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:11,646
Dude! Dude! Dude!

154
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:15,729
That coconut phone
might be good for the boat.

155
00:09:31,412 --> 00:09:32,606
Hi.

156
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,246
Hi.

157
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,604
I don't know why I'm here.

158
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,771
I didn't ask.

159
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,525
You want to come in?

160
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,125
I don't know.

161
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,530
Oh, okay.

162
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:54,330
I'll just leave the door open
and go sit on the couch.

163
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,530
Chandler is such an idiot!

164
00:09:58,772 --> 00:09:59,966
Drink?

165
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:03,567
-Scotch on the--
-Rocks with a twist?

166
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:05,725
I remember.

167
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:10,528
You still smoking cigars?

168
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:13,721
No. That's art.

169
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:17,642
If it bothers you,
I can put my art out.

170
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,928
No, that's okay.

171
00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,725
So, Monica. . .

172
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:26,650
. . .Iet me ask you a question.

173
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,042
Since we broke up, do you ever. . .

174
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:30,481
. . .think about me?

175
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:34,925
Actually, I thought about you
a couple months ago.

176
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,163
-Really?
-Yeah, but it's because l. . .

177
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,722
. . .had an eye exam,
and I don't like my new eye doctor.

178
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:43,445
-Who is it?
-Edward Nevsky.

179
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,091
Yeah, he's no good.

180
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:50,129
Do you ever think about me in. . .

181
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,411
. . .a non-eye-doctor way?

182
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:53,886
No.

183
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:01,921
Because getting over you was
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

184
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:04,682
I never let myself think about you.

185
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:14,811
Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?

186
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:16,644
You can't have two backups!

187
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,850
Of course I can.

188
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,560
It's just good sense
to back up your backup.

189
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:24,372
-Look, I've already lost Chandler.
-What?

190
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:26,440
Hey, Phoebe!

191
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:27,920
We're both backups?

192
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:30,646
How could you do this to me?

193
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:35,325
What are you complaining about?
You were both aware of the situation.

194
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,369
-I was not!
-No, we weren't!

195
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:41,082
This kind of back talk
isn't gonna fly when we're married.

196
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,923
You can't have both. Pick one.

197
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,571
-Pick me!
-No, pick me!

198
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:48,326
I don't want to end up an old maid.

199
00:11:49,532 --> 00:11:50,760
Well, let's see.

200
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:53,128
Ross is a good father.

201
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:54,566
But. . .

202
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,087
. . .Joey has a boat. This is hard.

203
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,448
This is crazy.
I want to switch to Rachel.

204
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,966
I want to switch too.

205
00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:03,089
No, wait!

206
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:06,770
Wait, guys.
Don't make any rash decisions.

207
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,923
Remember my promise:

208
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,010
If we get married,
three times a week.

209
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:13,731
Oh, my God. Phoebe. . . .

210
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,247
I'm talking about massages.

211
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,562
No, I'm not.

212
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,166
I know how to settle this.
Here's what we'll do.

213
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,528
I'll write "Joey" . . .

214
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:27,960
. . .on one napkin.

215
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,965
And I'm going to write "Ross"
on the other napkin. . .

216
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,770
. . .and we'll pick one.

217
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:35,321
That person will be our backup.
Here we go.

218
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,124
-That sounds fair.
-All right.

219
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:38,851
Good. Switching them up.

220
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,730
-Pick one.
-Left.

221
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,728
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

222
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:52,122
-Ross.
-Joey.

223
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,243
-We should just switch.
-Absolutely.

224
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,524
I miss this apartment.

225
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,962
Now, this is a grownup's apartment.

226
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,487
I should be with a grownup, you know?

227
00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:10,851
You're saying you need to be
with someone more mature.

228
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:12,606
Maybe someone with. . .

229
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:16,532
. . .a license to practice medicine.

230
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,450
Or a mustache.

231
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,326
Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.

232
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:25,325
I need to be with someone
who wants the same things.

233
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:29,730
Coming to my work and telling me
you love me, I want that!

234
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,921
Talking about pig sex over lunch,
I don't want that!

235
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:36,725
I think that's fair.

236
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,924
Fair? Please.
Don't even talk to me about fair.

237
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:42,925
Fair would've been you
wanting to marry me then.

238
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,447
Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

239
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,923
Believe me, nothing about this
is fair. Nothing.

240
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:51,925
-Nothing! Nothing!
-It's okay.

241
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,724
Nothing.

242
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,286
I don't know.

243
00:14:03,572 --> 00:14:05,130
I don't know.

244
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,406
I know.

245
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:13,767
I have to figure. . .

246
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:16,480
. . .some stuff, before I can. . . .

247
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,125
I understand.

248
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:21,328
Take as much time as you want.

249
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:24,089
1 0, 20 minutes, if you need it.

250
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,366
I'll be here. Not smoking.

251
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:45,925
Where is she?

252
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:47,969
I'm not scared of you.

253
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,332
She's not here. And please come in.

254
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:54,931
Scotch on the rocks. . .

255
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:57,441
. . .with a twist, on a coaster.

256
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:59,125
Monica?

257
00:15:00,932 --> 00:15:03,207
Okay, she was here. But she left.

258
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:04,771
Where did she go?

259
00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:07,401
She said she had to think things over.

260
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:11,845
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
I thought you were a good guy.

261
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:13,764
Look, nothing happened.

262
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:17,721
Nothing happened? Nothing?
You didn't tell her you love her?

263
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:20,532
Well, all right, one thing happened.

264
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,525
You know what you did?

265
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,927
My girlfriend is thinking things over.

266
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,288
You made my girlfriend think!

267
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,524
Well, I'm sorry.

268
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,643
What's to think about? I love her.

269
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,771
Well, apparently I'm willing
to offer her things that you are not.

270
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:41,209
I'm willing to offer her those things.
This was just a plan.

271
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:45,809
To throw her off so when I offered
all these things, she'd be surprised.

272
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,844
If it helps, it worked very well.

273
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:53,724
It was working till you showed up,
you big tree.

274
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,129
This isn't fair.

275
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:01,648
You had your chance with her,
and you blew it!

276
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,928
This is my chance
and I won't blow it. . .

277
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:06,327
. . .because we are
meant for each other.

278
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,729
And this has all just been
one stupid mistake!

279
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:12,528
I was gonna propose tonight.

280
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,486
You were?

281
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:18,725
Yeah, I even. . .

282
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:20,806
. . .got a ring.

283
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:22,925
Did you get a ring?

284
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:24,810
No, I don't have a ring.

285
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:31,406
You go get her.

286
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:37,127
And can I give you a piece of advice?

287
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,130
If you do get her. . .

288
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,764
. . .don't let her go.

289
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:43,365
Trust me.

290
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:49,522
You know, Richard,
you are a good guy.

291
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,131
I know.

292
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:55,565
I hate that.

293
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,967
-I've gotta find Monica.
-She's gone.

294
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:15,609
-What?
-She had a bag and she left.

295
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:17,729
-What?
-She was crying.

296
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:21,044
She said you want different things
and she needs to think.

297
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:23,567
Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?

298
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,929
I did! I told her everything.
She wouldn't believe me.

299
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:29,646
Where did she go?

300
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:32,326
To her parents.
She said you shouldn't call.

301
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,927
But if I were you, I would.

302
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:37,051
Can't believe I ruined this.

303
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:39,528
I am so sorry, man.

304
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:52,169
You wanted it to be a surprise.

305
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:03,645
Oh, my God.

306
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:11,331
Chandler. . .

307
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:14,529
. . .in all my life. . .

308
00:18:15,332 --> 00:18:17,721
. . .I never thought
I would be so lucky. . .

309
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:24,727
. . .as to fall in love
with my best. . .

310
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:27,525
. . .my best. . . .

311
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,331
There's a reason why
girls don't do this!

312
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:34,926
I'll do it. I thought. . . .

313
00:18:39,012 --> 00:18:40,570
Wait, I can do this.

314
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:47,324
I thought that it mattered. . .

315
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:50,922
. . .what I said or where I said it.

316
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,523
Then I realized. . .

317
00:18:53,972 --> 00:18:56,930
. . .the only thing that matters
is that you. . .

318
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:04,564
. . .you make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

319
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:09,528
And if you let me. . .

320
00:19:10,172 --> 00:19:14,131
. . .I will spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

321
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,330
Monica. . .

322
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:27,446
. . .will you marry me?

323
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:31,125
Yes.

324
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:46,687
I knew you were likely to take a wife!

325
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,961
Can we come in yet?
We're dying out here!

326
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,650
Come in! Come in!

327
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,330
We're engaged!

328
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:07,724
This is the least jealous
I've ever been!

329
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,244
Oh, no, wait! This is wrong!
Ross isn't here!

330
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:16,045
He's done it three times.
He knows what it's about!

00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:06,524
-Hey. Who wants French toast?
-I'll have some.

2
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,724
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

3
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:14,201
-What's the matter?
-My hand feels weird.

4
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:16,243
I guess it's because I'm engaged!

5
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:20,526
-When will that start getting annoying?
-Start?

6
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:23,963
Let's start the wedding plans.

7
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:25,287
-Okay.
-Already?

8
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:29,491
We got a lot to do. We gotta think
about the flowers, the music--

9
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:32,411
-I have thoughts on the music.
-Too many cooks. . . .

10
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:38,165
Take it from me. All you have to do
is show up and say the right name.

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,648
-What in God's name is that?
-Oh, my God, the wedding book?

12
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:48,127
I haven't seen that
since 4th grade.

13
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:53,247
This baby has everything. Take,
you know, locations for instance:

14
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:57,041
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically. . .

15
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:59,482
. . .then by square footage.

16
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,290
That is so smart.

17
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:05,841
Break it off. Break it off, now.

20
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,883
That conclusively proves. . .

21
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:50,721
. . .that I had the idea
for Jurassic Park first.

22
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,530
Let's take a look--

23
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:54,968
Phoebe, what are you doing here?

24
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:58,602
I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.

25
00:01:58,812 --> 00:02:01,121
Oh, my God. Of course.

26
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:04,000
Would you please excuse me
for a moment?

27
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:07,688
Do you know each other's hometowns?
Why don't you. . .?

28
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:09,931
What's going on?

29
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:14,523
Well, not much. I was just thinking
that since they just got engaged. . .

30
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:16,922
. . .it would be nice
if they have privacy.

31
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:20,647
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

32
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:27,007
Okay, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

33
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:29,328
Nothing. Why?

34
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:32,925
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

35
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:36,169
Yeah, it is. My movie starts
in five minutes.

36
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:43,211
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

37
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:48,925
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movie?

38
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:54,850
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents. . .

39
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,128
. . .but tell me how this is for music.

40
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:00,922
A string quartet for the processional,
a jazz trio for cocktails. . .

41
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:03,327
. . .the Bay City Rollers
for dancing. . . .

42
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:06,325
Wait, that was
for my 6th grade wedding.

43
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:10,925
You couldn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek. . . .

44
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,201
Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

45
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:19,891
Mon, do you have another pillow,
something a little snugglier?

46
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:23,124
Why are you napping here
instead of at your place?

47
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:25,323
-The duck.
-What, the duck?

48
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:27,807
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

49
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:32,920
Well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there. . .

50
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,289
. . .and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

51
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,091
Do I get to look at this book. . .

52
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:42,409
. . .or is it just for people
involved in the wedding?

53
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:46,204
Of course you can look at it.
I want your opinion.

54
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:47,447
Here you go.

55
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:50,126
-What about centerpieces?
-Centerpieces!

56
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:53,250
-Roses or lilies?
-Definitely roses.

57
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,368
I think they're more "wedding-y. "

58
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:06,001
-But lilies are the clear choice.
-Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

59
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:11,728
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

60
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,322
I'm gonna get cranky.

61
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:18,568
Joey, there's a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

62
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,967
Yes, it is perfectly good. . .

63
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:24,522
. . .and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

64
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:26,521
What?

65
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:30,841
-All right, I'm gonna go.
-Joey, what did the duck do?

66
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,925
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

67
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:48,325
Hey, little buddy. How you feeling?

68
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:54,126
What the hell is in that face cream?

69
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:09,328
That's so soft.

70
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,928
Pillowcases!

71
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:32,648
"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.
Her father, the vicar--"

72
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,120
Vicar?

73
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:37,522
"--wouldn 't be home for hours.

74
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,603
Her loins were burning.

75
00:05:39,852 --> 00:05:44,721
She threw caution to the wind
and reached out and grabbed his--"

76
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,328
This is a dirty book!

77
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:06,327
Phoebe?

78
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:08,091
Oh, Ross, hi.

79
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:14,327
-Phoebe, what are you doing?
-Sorry, I'm with a client right now.

80
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:18,605
-Phoebe!
-Okay, let's talk outside.

81
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,645
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

82
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:25,281
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

83
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:27,084
And they knew about it?

84
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:33,166
Okay, Ross, what is this really about?

85
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:37,447
This is my home, and I want to be
able to come and go when I want.

86
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:40,883
I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

87
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:42,810
I don't know what the big deal is.

88
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:45,845
I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment. . .

89
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:50,165
. . .when I want to kick back
with a puzzle-- Beer, cold beer.

90
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:54,883
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

91
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:58,927
Sweeping. Why?
Does it turn you on?

92
00:07:01,052 --> 00:07:02,167
No.

93
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:07,370
What if I was sweeping a chimney?

94
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:11,408
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

95
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:17,331
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

96
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:26,851
Joey, where did you learn that word?

97
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:30,964
Where do you think. . .

98
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:32,681
. . .Zelda?

99
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:38,563
-You found my book?!
-Yeah, I did!

100
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,404
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

101
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:46,525
I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have,
but you got porn!

102
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:51,289
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

103
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:56,162
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

104
00:07:56,412 --> 00:08:00,087
It's a healthy expression
of female sexuality. . .

105
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:04,166
. . .which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

106
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,164
You got porn.

107
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:32,721
-Hello.
-Hi, is Phoebe here?

108
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,768
-No, she's out for the night.
-Oh, great!

109
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,761
Can I help you with something?

110
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:41,929
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

111
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:43,965
Yes, I am.

112
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:48,161
Great! Dad?

113
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,325
Thank you so much.
I'll pick him up in an hour.

114
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:06,921
Your parents must've been thrilled
when you told them you were engaged.

115
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:09,282
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

116
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,442
I remember when we first got engaged.

117
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,722
-I've never heard that story.
-Dad, you don't--

118
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:17,048
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

119
00:09:18,572 --> 00:09:20,244
I still don't know how.

120
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:24,889
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

121
00:09:27,772 --> 00:09:29,490
What a sweet story.

122
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:33,290
At least you're not hearing it
at your 5th grade Halloween party.

123
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:35,084
They wanted a scary story.

124
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,927
We're really excited
about our wedding plans.

125
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:43,165
Pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the wedding fund.

126
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:50,246
-What?
-You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

127
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:52,881
You have the wedding fund, don't you?

128
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,209
We have it.
Only now we call it "the beach house. "

129
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,286
You spent my wedding
fund on the beach house?

130
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:03,931
We're sorry. We assumed. . .

131
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:06,891
. . .that when you turned 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

132
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,607
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

133
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:12,042
So you've had seven years
of beach fun. . .

134
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,408
. . .and you can't put a price on that.

135
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:18,723
We do feel bad about this.

136
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,684
We saved again
when you dated Richard.

137
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:23,446
Then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

138
00:10:26,172 --> 00:10:27,651
What about Chandler?

139
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:30,082
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd propose.

140
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,848
I didn't start drinking
enough at the start of the meal.

141
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,803
I can't believe there's no money
for my wedding.

142
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,048
Maybe, if your father hadn't tried. . .

143
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:42,846
. . .to sell ice over the lnternet.

144
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:46,567
-It seemed like such a simple idea.
-Stupid. The word is "stupid. "

145
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,884
Enough. I don't want
to hear about it anymore.

146
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:51,451
Good luck, Chandler.

147
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,841
Okay, now I'm going to. . .

148
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,040
. . .touch you.

149
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,809
That's soft.

150
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:00,445
Do you think your parents
could help pay for it?

151
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,448
I don't know.

152
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:05,844
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

153
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,327
Saving the rest for her divorce.

154
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:13,128
And any extra cash my father has,
he saves for his yearly trips to. . .

155
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:15,120
. . .Dollywood.

156
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:20,808
-What happened at dinner?
-My parents spent the wedding fund.

157
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,040
My God, what did you order?

158
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:29,928
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

159
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:33,488
You guys will have to get
married in, like, a rec center.

160
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:38,162
-Honey, it's gonna be okay.
-No, it's not gonna be okay.

161
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:42,366
-No swing band, no lilies.
-It's gonna be okay.

162
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:45,211
I mean, you don't need to have this. . .

163
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:48,205
. . .rustic ltalian feast.

164
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:50,482
You don't need this custom-made. . .

165
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:54,611
. . .empire waist, duchess satin gown.

166
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:56,490
You can wear off-the-rack.

167
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,211
It's really gonna be okay.

168
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:07,405
The important thing is, we love each
other and we're gonna get married.

169
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:11,127
Do you even understand what
"off-the-rack" means?

170
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:14,843
Why don't you pay for it yourself?

171
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:16,485
How? I don't have any money.

172
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,603
-I have some.
-How much?

173
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:19,847
Well, close to. . . .

174
00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:34,083
-Are you kidding me?!
-How much?

175
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,045
-Enough for wedding scenario A.
-Really?

176
00:13:37,252 --> 00:13:39,846
How great are you, you little saver!

177
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:42,965
This is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

178
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,970
You guys are so made for each other.

179
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,368
You're not suggesting we spend
all the money on the wedding?

180
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,125
Yeah.

181
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:57,121
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years. . .

182
00:13:57,332 --> 00:14:01,405
. . .and I have some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

183
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:05,127
Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.

184
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:11,128
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

185
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:15,086
I realize that, honey, but I won't
spend all the money on one party.

186
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,442
Honey, I love you.

187
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,968
But if you call our wedding
a party one more time. . .

188
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:22,725
. . .you may not get invited.

189
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:29,166
We can always earn more money.
We're only gonna get married once.

190
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:33,650
I understand, but I have to put
my foot down. The answer is no.

191
00:14:34,812 --> 00:14:36,928
You're gonna have
to put your foot down?

192
00:14:37,132 --> 00:14:39,327
Yes, I am.

193
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:44,246
Money and a firm hand.

194
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,960
Finally a Chandler
I can get onboard with.

195
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,967
CENTRAL
PERK

196
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:57,521
-Hey, Rach.
-Joey.

197
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:01,846
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

198
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:06,125
I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

199
00:15:06,852 --> 00:15:10,128
No, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

200
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:11,961
Something's on fire.

201
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,044
I don't smell anything.

202
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:17,809
You know what? It's probably
just your burning loins.

203
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:25,205
-Hey, what are you guys talking about?
-Nothing.

204
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,524
Damn, this coffee's cold.

205
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:32,848
Do you mind if I heat this
on your loins?

206
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:40,321
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey. . . .

207
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,764
I guess you bought that book
after we broke up.

208
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:47,482
I did, because I wore out my first
copy when I was with you.

209
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:50,120
Oh, yeah?

210
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:54,126
Well, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

211
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:56,321
'Sup?

212
00:15:57,692 --> 00:16:01,526
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

213
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:05,730
Excuse me, ladies.

214
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:08,125
I'm sorry?

215
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:10,607
My massage client. Arthur.

216
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:13,610
His daughter said some guy
that worked for me. . .

217
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,643
. . .gave him a really weird massage.

218
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:18,605
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

219
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:22,090
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

220
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,931
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

221
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:28,130
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks. . .

222
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:32,371
. . .and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

223
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:38,121
Well, he's never coming back.
You just cost me $80 a week.

224
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:41,449
This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

225
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:44,525
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

226
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:45,642
You could've sent him away.

227
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:48,804
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

228
00:16:50,412 --> 00:16:52,926
He said he liked that!

229
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:58,125
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,524
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

231
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:05,921
-His daughter was hot.
-Gotcha.

232
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:16,407
Listen. . .

233
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,563
. . .I've been thinking.

234
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:24,890
It's not fair of me to ask you to
spend all your money on our wedding.

235
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:27,930
I mean, you work really hard for that.

236
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,288
-Well.
-Well, you work for that.

237
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,806
Look, I've thought about it too.

238
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:39,284
I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all the money on the wedding.

239
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,967
-You do?
-Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

240
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:48,331
Look, when I proposed,
I told you. . .

241
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:51,803
. . .that I would do anything
to make you happy.

242
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:55,249
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy. . .

243
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:57,488
. . .then that's what we're gonna do.

244
00:17:57,892 --> 00:18:00,201
You are so sweet.

245
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,960
What about the future and stuff?

246
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:09,402
Forget about the future and stuff.

247
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:10,926
So we only have two kids.

248
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:14,801
We'll pick our favorite and
that one will get to go to college.

249
00:18:15,812 --> 00:18:18,326
-Have you thought about that?
-Yeah.

250
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:20,085
How many kids were we gonna have?

251
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,887
Four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

252
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:27,409
What else did you think about?

253
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:30,445
Well, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

254
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,206
Like a small place outside the city. . .

255
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,529
. . .where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes.

256
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:39,491
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar. . .

257
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:44,044
. . .and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

258
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:48,171
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.

259
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:54,606
You know what?

260
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:58,366
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

261
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,809
-Sure you do.
-No.

262
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:06,808
I want everything that you've
just said. I want a marriage.

263
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,206
You sure?

264
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:15,009
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

265
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:23,647
When you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

266
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,610
But you meant dog, right?

267
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:30,803
-Totally.
-Good.

268
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,810
Hello, Zelda.

269
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:48,809
-Who are you supposed to be?
-The vicar.

270
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:53,451
-Do you even know what a vicar is?
-Like a goalie, right?

271
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,045
Look, that's enough.

272
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:00,170
You make stupid jokes
and sleazy innuendoes. . .

273
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:02,169
. . .and it's just not funny anymore.

274
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:05,523
I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.

275
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:09,850
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

276
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:15,648
All right, that's it.
You want to do it? Let's do it.

277
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:20,367
That's right.
I want to do it with you.

278
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:26,563
Been trying to fight it,
but you said all the right things.

279
00:20:26,812 --> 00:20:27,961
I did?

280
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:31,409
Yeah, I been waiting for so long
to get on that body.

281
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:34,721
-This body?
-Yeah, that's right.

282
00:20:34,972 --> 00:20:36,928
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

283
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:40,647
You're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife in chapter seven.

284
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:44,966
Come on, now. Don't keep me
waiting. Take your clothes off.

285
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:49,245
But I'd keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

286
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:52,124
I don't want to. I'm scared.

1
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:05,088
The reason I asked you to brunch. . .

2
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:08,365
. . .is because I've been thinking
about my maid of honor.

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,529
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:12,488
I hope it's you.

5
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,490
-I hope it's you.
-Me too.

6
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:18,323
First of all,
I love you both so much.

7
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,128
-You're both so important to me.
-Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,841
I was thinking we could
come up with a system. . .

9
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,169
. . .where we trade off
being maid of honor.

10
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:31,490
-Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine--
-Yes! Oh.

11
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:34,441
Hypothetically.

12
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:35,722
Still.

13
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:40,927
If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would
be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

14
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:43,567
We all get to do it
and no one gets upset.

15
00:00:44,013 --> 00:00:47,926
-That's a pretty good idea.
-I'll do that. So, who's yours?

16
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:52,642
Well, that's the best part.
You guys get to decide.

17
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:57,611
-Why is that the best part?
-I don't have to.

18
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:03,768
Of course we'll help you decide.
We'll do anything we can to help you.

19
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,446
I'd like to make a toast.

20
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,608
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing. . .

21
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:13,326
. . .my best friend and truly one
of the nicest people that--

22
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,365
-Really not deciding.
-Fine.

23
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,727
Excuse me,
I couldn't help overhearing.

24
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:22,242
-You're marrying Chandler Bing?
-Yeah.

25
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:24,762
Good luck!

26
00:01:26,293 --> 00:01:28,727
Oh, and good luck to you too!

27
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,004
What a nice lady.

28
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:34,609

30
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:12,328
Yeah!

31
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:15,764
-Die Hard, still great.
-Yep.

32
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:17,725
Let's make it a double feature?

33
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,127
What else you rent?

34
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,604
Die Hard 2.

35
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,404
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.

36
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:29,652
Well, we'll watch it a second time
and it's Die Hard 2.

37
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,327
-Joey, we just saw it.
-And?

38
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,489
It would be cool to see it again!

39
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,406
-Yeah! Die Hard!
-Die Hard!

40
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:41,924
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.

41
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:44,326
Is everything okay?

42
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,128
Yeah, I just got plans.

43
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:50,530
Well, John McClane had plans.

44
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,325
I want to leave before
Joey gets all worked up. . .

45
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,803
. . .and starts calling
everybody "bitch. "

46
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:00,767
What are you talking about, bitch?

47
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,172
-Hey, Rachel.
-Yeah?

48
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:08,763
When I get married,
will you be my maid of honor?

49
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,326
Really?

50
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:13,725
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
I mean I'm just--

51
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,326
Wait a minute.

52
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:21,961
If I'm your maid of honor,
that means that you are Monica's.

53
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,526
Oh.

54
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:26,924
Well, if that's what you want.

55
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,607
No way, Phoebe.
I want to be Monica's.

56
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:33,964
-Why does it even matter?
-Why does it matter to you?

57
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,323
Because this one is now.

58
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,242
And it's two of our best friends.

59
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:41,848
And who knows what you're gonna marry.

60
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,890
What if I marry Ross? Or Joey?

61
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:49,612
You wouldn't.

62
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:55,332
Okay, look, Rachel.
I know you really want to do this. . .

63
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,730
. . .but I've never been
maid of honor to anyone before.

64
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:01,009
I know you've done it at least twice.

65
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:03,932
-Yeah, but Phoebe--
-Please let me finish.

66
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,131
I guess that was it.

67
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,127
Okay.

68
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:14,407
Since you've never done it before,
you can be Monica's maid of honor.

69
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,524
Oh, thank you so much!

70
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,327
Yay.

71
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,924
I'm gonna marry someone good.

72
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:25,802
Oh, I know.

73
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:27,532
Better than Chandler.

74
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,324
-What happened?
-I don't know.

75
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,292
We fell asleep. That is all.

76
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,882
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

77
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,410
All right, well, I'd better go.

78
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:00,490
-I think that would be best.
-Yeah.

79
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,285
-I'll talk to you later.
-Okay.

80
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:05,769
-But not about this.
-No, never. Never!

81
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,289
-Bye.
-No touch. No touch.

82
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:17,204
Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.

83
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:19,847
This woman overheard that
I was marrying you. . .

84
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,850
. . .and she wished me good luck.

85
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:23,242
That's sweet.

86
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,251
No, it was more like a "good luck. "

87
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,729
So, what did this woman look like?

88
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,128
She was, like, 30,
dark hair, attractive.

89
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:36,565
Any chance you were looking into a
bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

90
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,289
Was it someone you dated in college?

91
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:41,688
No, I only dated two girls
in college. . .

92
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,164
. . .both blond, both not attractive.

93
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,606
Let me check this out.

94
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:50,373
-What are you doing?
-Well, let's see.

95
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:53,286
Okay, is that her?

96
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:54,812
Oh, my God, yes!

97
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:58,568
-Who is she?
-Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.

98
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,285
Did you break up with her?

99
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,964
No, we're still together.

100
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:11,170
We went out for two summers
and then I broke up with her.

101
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,443
-Why?
-She came back the third summer. . .

102
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:17,123
. . .and she'd gotten really fa--

103
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,413
-Fat?
-I did not say fat.

104
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:25,167
I said fa--

105
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,051
You broke up with a girl
because she was fat?

106
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:30,971
Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:35,286
But it was a really long time ago.
Does she still feel bad?

108
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:36,767
Apparently she does.

109
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:39,771
You know what they say:
"Elephants never forget. "

110
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,162
Seriously, good luck marrying me.

111
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:51,567
Hey, what's going on?

112
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:53,650
She's Monica's maid of honor.

113
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:58,051
Hope it goes better than the last time
you did it for that girl downstairs.

114
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,727
You have been maid of honor before?

115
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:06,528
You see? This is exactly why
you shouldn't lie.

116
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,329
That's it. I am maid of honor.

117
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,569
-No, I am.
-How come you are?

118
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:14,333
Because I cared enough to lie.

119
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:17,253
Hey, I could help you decide
who should do it.

120
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:18,852
We could have an audition.

121
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:22,051
See how you'd handle
maid-of-honor-type situations.

122
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:24,369
-What do you mean?
-When I want a job. . .

123
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:27,650
. . .I audition and if I'm the best
of the people they see. . .

124
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:28,649
. . .I get the part.

125
00:07:28,853 --> 00:07:31,651
So, okay, so after this audition,
who decides who gets it?

126
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,969
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.

127
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,972
-It's better than us deciding.
-Oh, this is crazy.

128
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:40,649
-Can't we just flip a coin?
-No, coins hate me.

129
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:45,242
Okay, fine. You know what?
We will let Ross and Joey decide.

130
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,327
Hi!

131
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,689
Ross, sweetie.

132
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:54,606
Hey there, handsome thing.

133
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:02,245
Wow, this cologne really is
every bit as good as Giorgio.

134
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,448
Hey.

135
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:12,605
Just brought back your videos.

136
00:08:12,813 --> 00:08:16,567
Hey, Ross. Look, I think
we need to talk about before.

137
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:18,650
No. No, we don't.

138
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:20,003
Yes, we do.

139
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:23,644
Now, look.
That was the best nap I ever had.

140
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:30,852
I don't know what
you're talking about.

141
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:32,972
Come on, admit it.

142
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,164
That was the best nap you ever had.

143
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,851
I've had better.

144
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,251
Okay. When?

145
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,726
All right! All right!
It was the best nap ever!

146
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,372
I said it, okay?

147
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,450
But it's over, Joey!

148
00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:52,886
I want to do it again.

149
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,684
We can't do it again.

150
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,248
-Why not?
-Because it's weird!

151
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,052
Fine.

152
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,322
You want a drink?

153
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,923
-Sure. What do you got?
-Warm milk and Excedrin PM.

154
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:18,246
Chandler.

155
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,283
I just figured out who you are.

156
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,643
Can you figure out what I'm doing?

157
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:27,527
-You're Louis Posen.
-Who?

158
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,847
He was my best friend in fifth grade.

159
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:34,284
One day, I asked him to be
my boyfriend and he said no.

160
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,648
Do you know why?

161
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,926
Because you kept talking to him while
he was trying to go to the bathroom?

162
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,530
No, but because he thought
I was too fa--

163
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,764
Every time I think about it,
I feel as bad as I did then.

164
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,441
I really think you should
apologize to Julie.

165
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:54,651
Honey, are you kidding?
That was like 1 6 years ago.

166
00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:58,482
It would make me feel better
if Louis apologized to me.

167
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:02,129
I'll do it. But I warn you,
this may make me a better person.

168
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,927
And that is not the man
you fell in love with.

169
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,687
Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
maid-of-honor situations.

170
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,202
You'll be scored
on a scale of one to ten.

171
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,722
-One being the highest.
-Ten is the highest.

172
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:19,084
-Why is 1 0 the highest?
-Because it's the highest.

173
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,085
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.

174
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,932
Situation number one:
You're with Monica.

175
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,126
The wedding is about to start
when Monica gets cold feet. Go!

176
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,489
I don't want to marry Chandler.

177
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,849
-I've got cold feet.
-It's gonna be okay.

178
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,362
One man the rest of my life?
I don't know.

179
00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:41,007
This means I'll never
get to sleep with Joey.

180
00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,329
Look, Monica. . .

181
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,564
. . .getting cold feet is very common.

182
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,082
It's just because
of all the anticipation.

183
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,292
And you just have to remember
that you love Chandler.

184
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,927
And also, I ran out on a wedding.

185
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:59,482
You don't get to keep the gifts.

186
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,483
Drawing on your own experience.

187
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:03,887
Very good.

188
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:06,323
Yes, very nice, Rachel.

189
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,727
Thank you, judges.

190
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,889
-Kiss ass.
-Oh.

191
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,888
-Okay, Phoebe.
-Yes, Your Honor.

192
00:11:14,853 --> 00:11:16,571
We're now in the ceremony.

193
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,729
Monica is about to say, "I do" . . .

194
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:21,203
. . .when her drunk uncle
starts yelling.

195
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:22,727
What do you do? Go!

196
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,441
When Monica was a little girl. . .

197
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:27,484
. . .I remember that--

198
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:31,612
Ow!

199
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:33,206
-Very good!
-Oh.

200
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,730
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.

201
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:39,204
She just made a scene
in the middle of the ceremony!

202
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:42,092
Hey, you want
a little taste of Pheebs?

203
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:47,330
It is time for you to give
your maid-of-honor speech.

204
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,966
We haven't even prepared--

205
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,403
-Go!
-Okay, okay, okay.

206
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,922
Webster's Dictionary
defines marriage as--

207
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:59,411
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
Okay, never mind. Forget it.

208
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:04,408
I met-- I met Monica when we were
just a couple of 6-year-olds. . .

209
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:09,323
. . .and became friends with Chandler
when he was 25. . .

210
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,803
. . .although he seemed
like a 6-year-old.

211
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:13,971
Oh.

212
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,803
Thank you. Thank you very much.

213
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:21,247
I've known them
separately and together.

214
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:26,408
To know them as a couple is to know
that you are in the presence of love.

215
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:29,810
So I would like to raise my glass. . .

216
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,605
. . .to Monica and Chandler. . .

217
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:36,125
. . .and the beautiful adventure they
are about to embark upon together.

218
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:39,843
I can think of no two people
better prepared for the journey.

219
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,172
Wow.

220
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,603
-Great speech.
-Yeah, it really was.

221
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:46,802
Oh, thanks.

222
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:51,763
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
Although I really don't see the point.

223
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,208
Okay.

224
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:01,603
I can't believe that Monica
and Chandler are getting married.

225
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,281
I remember talking
about this day with Rachel. . .

226
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,212
. . .while we were
showering together, naked.

227
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,404
And she's back in the game!

228
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:26,802
Julie. Hi.

229
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,163
Chandler Bing.
I guess you remember me.

230
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:31,404
Hello, Skidmark.

231
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,403
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

232
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,406
It's pretty clear.

233
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:44,443
I owe you a long, overdue apology.

234
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:47,963
I shouldn't have broken up with you
because of your weight.

235
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,604
That's why you broke up with me?

236
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,804
You didn't know that?

237
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,923
Well, I guess my work here is done.

238
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:09,123
First of all, I would like to say
you both performed very well, okay?

239
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:10,852
You should be proud.

240
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:15,644
And I'd also like to say, in this
competition, there are no losers.

241
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,088
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

242
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,171
Really? I won.

243
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,206
-What?
-I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

244
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,962
-Well, then I demand a recount!
-Actually, it wasn't that close.

245
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:31,131
You know what?
Your thing was so stupid anyway.

246
00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,489
We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

247
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:35,241
Heads.

248
00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,607
What? The coins have
finally forgiven me!

249
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:44,249
Know what? I hope Monica
forgives you after you throw her. . .

250
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:49,328
. . .vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
shower.

251
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:54,131
Rach, it's gonna be okay.
You guys are the best!

252
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,922
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
took a lot out of me.

253
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,248
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

254
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:05,526
Thinking about maybe going upstairs
and taking a little nap on my couch.

255
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,922
Why would I care about that?

256
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:15,125
No reason. I'm just saying that. . .

257
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,526
. . .that's where I'll be.

258
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,207
As bad as that went,
I actually enjoyed myself.

259
00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:44,565
I think that I'm going to apologize
for all the stupid things that I do.

260
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,247
Why don't you just stop
doing stupid things?

261
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,406
-Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
-I'd love it if I could do both.

262
00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:57,125
All right, I have to ask.

263
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,562
What?

264
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,008
Will you break up with me
if I get fat?

265
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,328
What?

266
00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:06,684
You broke up with Julie.
How much weight did she gain?

267
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:09,123
A hundred and forty-five pounds.

268
00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:11,721
In one year?

269
00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:14,089
My God, what did she eat?
Her family?

270
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,051
That's not the point.

271
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:22,041
I know it was a stupid reason to
break up with someone, but I was 1 5.

272
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:26,292
Yeah, well, that's not
the only time this was an issue.

273
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,611
You remember when you spent
Thanksgiving with us?

274
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:31,882
You called me fat.

275
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,202
Wait a minute.

276
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,927
-That was totally different.
-How?

277
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:39,762
You were not supposed to hear that.
I said that behind your back.

278
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:44,364
What if I have babies, okay?
I'm gonna look different.

279
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:47,007
I'm okay with that,
but I'm not sure you are.

280
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:51,001
You have to realize I don't think
of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

281
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:58,243
This is one of the things that
I can apologize for later.

282
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,163
What I mean is, you're Monica.

283
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,331
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

284
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,082
Keep going.

285
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:11,172
So you can balloon up
or you can shrink down. . .

286
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,290
. . .and I will still love you.

287
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,930
Even if I were to shrink down
to 2 inches tall?

288
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:20,849
I'd carry you around in my pocket.

289
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,282
I love you.

290
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:29,326
Skidmark still got a way
with the ladies.

291
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:33,202
Hi, Pheebs.

292
00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,766
-Hi.
-Hi.

293
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,571
I just want to apologize.

294
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,088
I'm really sorry I was a baby.

295
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:42,683
That's ridiculous.
Rachel, we were all babies once.

296
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,249
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.

297
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:51,529
Yeah, and you know,
you deserve to win.

298
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,531
And I was thinking about it.

299
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,765
If you're Monica's maid of honor,
I get to be yours.

300
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,964
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

301
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:04,408
When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
I put some stuff together.

302
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:07,411
-Just in case.
-Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

303
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:10,764
Here is a book of poetry
that I know Monica loves.

304
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:13,083
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

305
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:16,922
Here's a picture from one Halloween
when she dressed up as a bride.

306
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:18,691
She made me carry her train. . .

307
00:18:18,893 --> 00:18:21,885
. . .which was weird
because I was Wonder Woman.

308
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:26,127
Oh, and here's
a little purse that I found.

309
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,052
I just thought they could hold
the rings in there.

310
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,813
-Oh.
-Something. And. . .

311
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:36,370
. . .vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
because people cry at weddings.

312
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:38,922
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

313
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:42,288
This stuff is great.

314
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,723
I forgot this was in here.

315
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:50,563
This was the garter
that I was saving for my wedding.

316
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:54,328
And I wanted it
to be Monica's "something borrowed. "

317
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,241
And it's blue.

318
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:05,329
Rach, I think that you should be
Monica's maid of honor.

319
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,726
You do?

320
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,730
-Why?
-Because I think it means more to you.

321
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,763
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

322
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:18,004
It's fine.
I mean, this is something. . .

323
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:21,728
. . .that you've been thinking about
since you were, what, 1 4?

324
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:24,931
No, I was 1 0.
I just developed early.

325
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,604
Man alive!

326
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,125
-Hey, what's going on?
-Hey!

327
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,291
We decided Rachel is
going to be your maid of honor.

328
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:37,929
Oh, that's great!

329
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:41,370
Oh, wow. Okay, we really
have to start planning.

330
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,569
I have really specific ideas.

331
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,769
We should meet four times a week.

332
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,726
Come to my place,
we'll get together before work.

333
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:52,530
What do you say, 6:30, my place?
So excited!

334
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,329
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.

335
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:03,972
She's gonna be yours.

336
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,252
Great nap.

337
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,284
It really was.

338
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,485
What the hell are you doing?

339
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:44,812
God!

340
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:52,406
Excuse me.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,204
-Morning.
-Hi.

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:07,131
How was your date?

3
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:09,608
-Pretty good.
-Oh, good.

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:13,922
My God. Sorry about that.

5
00:00:15,372 --> 00:00:17,010
Okay, really good.

6
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:18,971
I gotta go. I'm late.

7
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:21,163
You're going to leave
her with me?

8
00:00:21,372 --> 00:00:23,328
Don't worry,
she's a terrific girl.

9
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:24,846
Can you do me a favor?

10
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:29,404
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

11
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,364
What, are you kidding?

12
00:00:31,572 --> 00:00:34,848
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

13
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:38,209
Tell her I'm a loner.
No, an outlaw.

14
00:00:38,452 --> 00:00:41,410
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

15
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:42,931
That's a lot to remember.

16
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:45,163
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

17
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:48,042
I'm gonna call her later myself.

18
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:49,441
Honest.

19
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:52,604
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

20
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,412
Plus he'd make extras
and leave them for me.

21
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:59,009
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

22
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:00,406
Fine.

23
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,961
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

24
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,807
-Hi.
-Hi.

25
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:12,084
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

26
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:15,250
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

27
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:18,486
-You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
-Hi.

28
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:23,484
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

29
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,651
Would you like some pancakes?

30
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,328
The One with Ross' Library Book

31
00:01:31,532 --> 00:01:32,521
English Subtitles by
Gelula/SDI

32
00:02:08,492 --> 00:02:12,201
-Come on. Why are we here?
-Okay, okay, take a guess.

33
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:15,051
The hot chicks?

34
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:19,526
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier. . .

35
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,887
. . .you know, for fun.

36
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:24,211
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up?

37
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:26,204
My doctoral dissertation.

38
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:30,331
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

39
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,130
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

40
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:37,605
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

41
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:42,000
What is that?

42
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:46,601
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

43
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,402
We're so sorry.

44
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,206
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

45
00:03:05,572 --> 00:03:07,244
She sent the chicken back again?

46
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:11,411
She said it's too dry now and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

47
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:13,847
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

48
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:15,764
Send the colonel in.

49
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:24,205
Oh, my God!

50
00:03:26,092 --> 00:03:27,605
Lucky bastard.

51
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:31,043
-Janice.
-How are you. . .

52
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:36,167
. . .Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

53
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,405
I'm fine.

54
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:43,922
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

55
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,086
So who's the lucky guy?

56
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,126
Oh, my God.

57
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,567
I am so sorry, sweetie.

58
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,603
Are you okay?

59
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,444
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

60
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,041
-She saw the ring.
-Did she freak out?

61
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:08,369
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

62
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:12,766
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

63
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,400
Name's Clark.

64
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:17,446
She also invited herself
to our wedding.

65
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,011
Clark too.

66
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,320
You said no, right?

67
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:28,243
You said no, right?

68
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:31,444
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

69
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:33,523
-What was I supposed to do?
-Lie.

70
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:37,122
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail. "

71
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,602
"Oh, your baby's so cute. "

72
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:43,603
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross. "

73
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,371
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

74
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:52,247
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

75
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,087
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

76
00:04:56,812 --> 00:05:00,407
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

77
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:05,249
You know what? It'll be okay.

78
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:07,926
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

79
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:11,403
-Really?
-No, that was a lie.

80
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:13,848
See how easy that was?

81
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:17,445
So you would have just lied?

82
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,011
Yes.

83
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:23,001
-It would have really been that easy?
-Yes.

84
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:26,170
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

85
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:34,241
Hey, what's up?

86
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,642
Hey, who's your friend?

87
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:42,644
-Hey, Joey.
-Erin.

88
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:44,920
You're still here.

89
00:05:46,452 --> 00:05:50,331
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

90
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:53,205
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

91
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,647
And then there's you guys.

92
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:59,089
Well, listen, I better get going.

93
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,611
Today was great. Thanks.

94
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,407
And Joey, last night was fun.

95
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,887
Yeah. I'll call you.

96
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,923
-I'll call you too.
-Or I'll call you.

97
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,730
-And call me.
-Okay.

98
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:12,845
Good to see you again.

99
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:14,810
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

100
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:19,404
The system kind of broke down, huh?

101
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:23,728
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

102
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,650
And we got to talking, and l--

103
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:27,769
We want you to marry her.

104
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:29,681
What?

105
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:32,281
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

106
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,289
Who do you think brought her here?

107
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:35,806
Cupid.

108
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,287
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

109
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:43,211
Man, do you know what guys want.

110
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,603
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

111
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:53,003
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

112
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,691
My beers?!

113
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:58,004
Look, she's a very nice girl.

114
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,124
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

115
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:02,685
You always say that.

116
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:05,645
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

117
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:08,525
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just don't think so.

118
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:10,890
-Whatever.
-Fine.

119
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:13,811
Hey, don't start judging me.

120
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:15,889
You're in love with your assistant.

121
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:19,689
You're sleeping with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

122
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:21,801
Phoebe!

123
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,003
Secret affair.

124
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:36,205
People are doing it
in front of my book.

125
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:38,448
I'm sorry?

126
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:43,124
My doctoral dissertation is in the
library at school. I went to see it.

127
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:48,367
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

128
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:52,284
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

129
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:54,606
At your school. . .

130
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:59,727
. . .was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

131
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,121
Yeah, there was.

132
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:05,650
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

133
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,883
Yes, there was.

134
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:12,086
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

135
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,931
Hold on a second.

136
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:17,005
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

137
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,889
Oh, for crying out loud!

138
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:26,401
-So we should go catch our movie.
-What's the rush?

139
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:29,212
I'd like to see the previews.

140
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,605
The candy.

141
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:36,123
-Oh, hey.
-Well, look who's here.

142
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,805
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Erin.

143
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,206
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.

144
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:41,926
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

145
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:45,564
-Oh, no!
-What's wrong?

146
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:49,811
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

147
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,809
Oh, no.

148
00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:53,761
What party?

149
00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:55,804
A birthday party.

150
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,245
Whose birthday party?

151
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,608
Alison's birthday party.

152
00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:04,280
And how old is Alison?

153
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,851
Thirty-two.

154
00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:12,400
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

155
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:15,001
Look how that worked out.

156
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:22,250
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

157
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:27,088
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

158
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,045
Well, yes.
Just give me five minutes.

159
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,204
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

160
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:38,445
No, no, no.

161
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,603
Can I speak to someone in charge?

162
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:45,202
How can I help?

163
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:48,722
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security. . .

164
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,803
. . .in the paleontology section?

165
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,650
I wrote a book that's up there.

166
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,122
And instead of reading it,
people are. . . .

167
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:58,364
Well, they're rolling around
in front of it.

168
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:02,609
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

169
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,721
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

170
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:13,281
I can't help you.

171
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:15,046
Well, fine.

172
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,011
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation. . .

173
00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:21,887
. . .of the sanctity of the written
word, then I'll go defend it myself.

174
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,403
Don't you follow me.

175
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:31,930
-How did it go with Erin?
-Unbelievable.

176
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,049
We had the best time.

177
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:38,647
-So you're not mad anymore?
-No, no. You guys were totally right.

178
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:41,002
This was much better than
the first date.

179
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:43,646
It was awkward.
We were both nervous.

180
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,804
-Didn't you sleep together?
-Yeah, that calms me down.

181
00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,649
And we have so much in common.

182
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:55,807
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

183
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:58,846
Not an issue now,
but if we had kids. . . .

184
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,801
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

185
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:06,211
Oh, my Joey.

186
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:08,602
Please don't get married before I do.

187
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:18,167
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

188
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,806
He may still show up.

189
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,206
What are you, stupid?

190
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:25,802
-It's been three hours.
-Is that all?

191
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:30,202
Let's go on to happier things.

192
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:32,846
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding.

193
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:37,648
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

194
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:41,009
It's going to be a small ceremony.

195
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,810
Tiny.

196
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:46,605
We're not even sure
why we're having it.

197
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,329
It's actually going to be just family.

198
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:54,802
Oh, wait.

199
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,520
You two think of me as family?

200
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:05,209
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

201
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:09,849
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

202
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:15,242
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

203
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:18,609
-What about Benitez?
-What about game one of the series?

204
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:21,207
-What about shut up?
-You shut up.

205
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,048
I love arguing with her.

206
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,010
-Be right back.
-Okay.

207
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:28,920
How's it going with Joey?

208
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:31,009
Oh, okay.

209
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,571
Okay?

210
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:36,606
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

211
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:41,005
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out. . .

212
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:44,045
. . .but I just don't see this
having a future.

213
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:49,245
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

214
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:52,131
Did you just change your mind?

215
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:55,206
-Kind of.
-Then change it back!

216
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:59,841
I'm sorry.
It's just, there's no real spark.

217
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:01,804
Didn't you sleep together?

218
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,361
Yeah.

219
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:05,204
Tramp.

220
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:08,451
Does Joey have any idea?

221
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,922
I don't think he does.
You know what?

222
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,811
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested. . .

223
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:15,883
. . .in a serious relationship.

224
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,402
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

225
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:20,965
Yeah, that'd be great.

226
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,852
And maybe that you're a real stronzo.

227
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:24,848
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:28,601
I guess ltalian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

229
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,406
-Hey. Want to go?
-Yeah, let's go.

230
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,610
-Okay. See you guys later.
-Bye, guys.

231
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,568
Hey, thank you so much.

232
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:44,081
Wow.

233
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:47,005
I guess it wasn't cupid
that brought her here.

234
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:50,642
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

235
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,852
Yes, yes. How can I help you?

236
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:01,810
We were just looking around.

237
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:04,207
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

238
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,807
What exactly were you looking for?

239
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,009
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
musings. . .

240
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:13,601
. . .on the Smilodon californicus?

241
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:17,561
Get out of here!

242
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,331
Meeting someone?

243
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:31,126
Or are you just here to brush up. . .

244
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,170
. . .on Merriam's views on evolution?

245
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:38,843
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

246
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,443
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

247
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,729
I'm sorry. Who are you?

248
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,048
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

249
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,807
Ross Geller? Why do I know that name?
It's a. . . .

250
00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:57,161
Wait.

251
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:02,240
Did you write this?

252
00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:04,525
Yes.

253
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:11,326
You're the person
who checked out my book?

254
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,803
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

255
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:18,845
You're so young.

256
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:23,601
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

257
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:35,006
I am very, very sorry.

258
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:47,440
-So how was your date?
-Great. We walked around the Village.

259
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,206
We went to this ice cream place.
Split a milk shake.

260
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,044
Seventy-thirty, but still.

261
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:56,687
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed and breakfasts.

262
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:59,087
Really? She said she wants to go?

263
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:03,769
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be
tricky, because she's busy at work.

264
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:08,889
Joey, look, honey,
we need to talk, okay?

265
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,123
I got the feeling from her. . .

266
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,604
. . .that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

267
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,160
-Where are you getting this?
-She told me.

268
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:25,202
She said she's kind of a loner.

269
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,607
-Joey--
-Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

270
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,406
I'm a loner too, right?

271
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:42,689
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

272
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:47,602
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

273
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,209
No, don't do that. Just. . . .

274
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:58,004
-Next time, make sure she likes me.
-Well, that too.

275
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,200
Joey?

276
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:09,403
-Do you want some pancakes?
-Finally.

277
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,765
What are we gonna do?

278
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,924
I say we go with "Careless Whisper. "

279
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:21,881
Chandler?

280
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:24,607
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

281
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,203
Janice, what are you doing here?

282
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:34,125
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment. . .

283
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:39,207
. . .but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

284
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:48,247
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

285
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:51,689
Just, I really feel like I need
to be with family.

286
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:56,604
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

287
00:17:57,172 --> 00:18:01,882
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

288
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:06,007
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

289
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:09,611
-You have any tissues?
-Yeah, in the bathroom.

290
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,964
We'll just let her stay.

291
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:19,211
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

292
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:23,489
-Kind of like your Barcalounger.
-Is that what you're thinking about?

293
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:25,410
I never stop thinking about it.

294
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:28,486
Hey, you guys?

295
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,604
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

296
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:35,644
Janice, I'm sorry. . .

297
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:39,089
. . .but you can't stay here tonight.

298
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:40,681
Why not?

299
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:42,405
Honestly?

300
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:45,724
Our apartment is a hotbed. . .

301
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:48,406
. . .for electromagnetic activity.

302
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:53,050
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly. . .

303
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:56,204
. . .you have not.

304
00:19:02,212 --> 00:19:03,691
I'm gonna need a comforter.

305
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:07,288
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

306
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:14,002
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

307
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:16,005
Do you hear that? Listen.

308
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,367
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

309
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:23,527
Why?

310
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,640
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

311
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,207
He does?

312
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:35,204
Say again?

313
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:38,122
That's right. That's right.

314
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:41,290
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

315
00:19:41,532 --> 00:19:44,524
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

316
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:48,409
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

317
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:54,402
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away. . .

318
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,568
. . .but you can.

319
00:19:57,652 --> 00:20:00,325
Oh, my God.

320
00:20:00,572 --> 00:20:04,042
I understand. I am so sorry.

321
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:05,605
I'll go.

322
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,211
Goodbye, Monica.

323
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:16,331
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

324
00:20:16,532 --> 00:20:17,521
Chandler.

325
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,647
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

326
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,523
I've got this section covered.

327
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:38,605
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eyes.

328
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:40,490
Okay, see you later.

329
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,607
I just wanted
to show Monica your book.

1
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:06,883  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
- No, no, no.

2
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:09,812  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are we keeping Thanksgiving
a secret this year?

3
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:12,045  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:524
We're playing a game
I learned.

4
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:14,687  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:524
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.

5
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:17,401  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
What? That's like insanely easy.

6
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:20,081  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's harder than it sounds.
You always forget one.

7
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,325  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:524
Or in some cases, 14.

8
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:28,845  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's stupid and I wasn't playing with
people, so technically, I didn't lose.

9
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,964  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
You forgot 14 states?

10
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:33,443  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nobody cares about the Dakotas!

11
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,166  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, time's up.

12
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:37,692  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, I got 4<i>8</i>.

13
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,326  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's not bad. Pheebs?

14
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:43,446  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got tired of naming states,
so I listed the types of celery.

15
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:47,449  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I have one, regular celery.

16
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:52,452  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
So Rachel's got 4<i>8</i>
and Phoebe has the lead in...

17
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,251  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
...vegetables. Joey?

18
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:58,605  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Say hello to the new champ
of Chandler's dumb states game.

19
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:02,650  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Wow, how many you got?
- Fifty-six.

00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,328  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, how is New England not a state?

23
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,610  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:052 Y2:093
They have a sports team.

24
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,603  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:484 Y2:524
Does South Oregon have a sports team?

25
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,252  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
There you go.

26
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:57,084  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:052 Y2:093
Why one extra place setting?

27
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:58,726  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
You invited your assistant.

28
00:01:58,973 --> 00:02:01,533  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:052 Y2:094
Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

29
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,492  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:052 Y2:126
His girlfriend came into town,
so he's with her.

30
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:05,648  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why didn't you tell me?

31
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,010  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:052 Y2:131
I made him his own
sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

32
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:12,209  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:052 Y2:131
I was going to,
but then I figured...

33
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:15,530  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:052 Y2:131
...your food is so delicious
and perfect...

34
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:18,924  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:052 Y2:131
...you can never have too many
of those pumpkin things.

35
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:24,004  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:052 Y2:129
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that
since it's so fake, but I still do.

36
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:26,842  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:052 Y2:093
Regular celery!

37
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,811  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:052 Y2:093
I already have that.

38
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:32,328  X1:296 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Done...

39
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:34,529  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:052 Y2:093
...with time to spare.

40
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:39,204  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:052 Y2:132
- This may be a new world's record.
- I hate to lecture you guys...

41
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:42,923  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:052 Y2:132
...but it's disgraceful that
a group of well-educated adults...

42
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:47,610  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
...and Joey can't name all the states.

43
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:53,007  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
You ever see a map or one of those
round colorful things called a globe?

44
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:57,082  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
Magellan? You got 46 states.

45
00:02:57,293 --> 00:03:00,808  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What? That's impossible.
- Forty-six.

46
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:04,284  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, who's well-educated now,
Mr. L-Forgot-Ten-States?

47
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:08,204  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.

48
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:11,291  X1:109 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please, watch him.
Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

49
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,085  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
I am only one man.

50
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,687  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay, time is up.
- Now, just give me another minute.

51
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:20,930  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
If you don't know them by now,
you never will, okay?

52
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:25,012  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

53
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,404  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
This is crazy. I can do this.

54
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,929  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
All right, I bet I can get
all 50 before dinner.

55
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:33,283  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

56
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:34,812  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're on.

57
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:38,523  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't look at my list, because there's
a lot on there that you don't have.

58
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:43,164  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:482 Y2:524
Did you know your oven doesn't work?

59
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:46,126  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
The drawer full of takeout
menus is okay, right?

60
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,527  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
Ross, I'm gonna use yours.

61
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,041  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:524
Chandler, give me a hand.

62
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:57,247  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joey, do not let Ross look at maps
or the globe in your apartment.

63
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:00,286  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't worry.
It's not a globe of the United States.

64
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:10,207  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

65
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,603  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

66
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:15,247  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Oh, it's not.
- Seriously, it's moving.

67
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,803  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What the hell's in there?
- It's just my knitting. That's all.

68
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:26,409  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, I knit this.

69
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,406  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm very good.

70
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:36,925  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
Ross' apartment is nice.
Why don't we hang out here?

71
00:04:37,173 --> 00:04:38,845  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe because it smells weird.

72
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:41,209  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's like old pumpkins or something.

73
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:44,605  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
- That's my pie.
- Which smells delicious.

74
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:47,004  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- What?

75
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,090  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
We left Joey alone with the food.

76
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,446  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yep, yep, I knew it.

77
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,206  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
There he is...

78
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:56,405  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
...feeding stuffing to a dog!

79
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:04,612  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
How can I help?

80
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,289  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why is a dog in our apartment?

81
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,211  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, who's this?

82
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,284  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's a dog sitting on my couch.

83
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:15,451  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue!

84
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:19,849  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
- There's no dog here.
- There is!

85
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,129  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's black and white and shaggy.

86
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,608  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>He's sitting next to Rachel</i>
<i>and licking her hand. </i>

87
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,202  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God! Where are you?

88
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:29,883  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll be right there.

89
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,361  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're here already?
How are they doing this?!

90
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,283  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, Tag.
What are you doing here?

91
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:45,565  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wanted to see if your offer
was still good.

92
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:47,684  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, sure. Come in.

93
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:50,444  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, what happened
to your girlfriend?

94
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:52,809  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
We kind of broke up this morning.

95
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:56,289  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

96
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:59,007  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ohio, thank you.

97
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:04,926  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where's the dog?

98
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,203  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
What dog? There's no dog here.

99
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,409  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, that dog left.

100
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:14,571  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.

101
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:16,969  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's no dog in here.

102
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,603  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.

103
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,122  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, that's just me coughing.

104
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:29,572  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, good. There you are.

105
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:32,725  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
Listen, I have a dog in my room.

106
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:34,726  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
What is it doing here?

107
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:37,128  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm watching it for friends
who left town.

108
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:38,528  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait.

109
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:42,532  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hello, my name is Klunkers.

110
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:45,727  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
May I please stay
with you nice people?

111
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,931  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wish he could stay,
but Chandler's allergic.

112
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,851  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
Extremely allergic, okay?

113
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:55,130  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
If I'm anywhere near a dog
for more than five minutes...

114
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,841  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
...my throat will just close up.

115
00:06:58,053 --> 00:07:01,443  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's odd. This dog's been
living here for the past three days.

116
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,521  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

117
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,446  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:444 Y2:524
If he's been here
that long...

118
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:14,890  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
...without a reaction, maybe
you're not allergic to it.

119
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:16,606  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
It still has to go, right?

120
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:17,928  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why?

121
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:21,726  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, it's...
- Don't do it!

122
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:25,530  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Don't do what?
- I have to.

123
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,923  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay? It's time.

124
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:33,521  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I hate dogs.

125
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,610  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?!
- That's crazy? Why?

126
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:38,532  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:484 Y2:524
Told you.

127
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,532  X1:228 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
They are needy...

128
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:47,531  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:524
...jumpy, and you can't tell
what they are thinking...

129
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:50,128  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and that scares me a little bit.

130
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:53,292  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're right. They are scary.

131
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:56,724  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
She just ate a treat out of my hand!

132
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,244  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait. Do you not like all dogs?

133
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:01,812  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, not even puppies?

134
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:03,571  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is there a puppy here?

135
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,772  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You don't like puppies?
- Okay, you are new.

136
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:15,805  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, Chandler, I told you. Never
tell anyone about this dog thing.

137
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,884  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

138
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:22,571  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You don't like ice cream?
- It's too cold!

139
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,531  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's just that dogs make me
a little uncomfortable.

140
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:28,166  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hurts my teeth.

141
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:31,164  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
And I don't want you guys
to hate me...

142
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:34,883  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:524
...but I don't think I can be around
that dog anymore, okay?

143
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:38,364  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
So either the dog goes or I go.

144
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,564  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

145
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,371  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
How can I not get this?

146
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,963  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm a college professor.
I got 1 450 on my SATs.

147
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:57,527  X1:261 X2:453 Y1:484 Y2:524
Twelve fifty.

148
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:00,564  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
Damn, I forgot you were here.

149
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,369  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

150
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:04,762  X1:213 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:524
We'll be back soon.

151
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:06,770  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can I ask you a question?

152
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,643  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
When a guy breaks up
with his girlfriend...

153
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:13,766  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:446 Y2:524
...what is an appropriate amount
of time to wait before making a move?

154
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:15,565  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd say about a month.

155
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,769  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
Really? I'd say three to four.

156
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:18,849  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:524
Half-hour.

157
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,372  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
Interesting.

158
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:26,930  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:524
When it's your assistant,
I'd say never.

159
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:30,569  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right, Rach, the big question is,
does he like you?

160
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:34,561  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:524
Because if he doesn't like you,
this is all a moo point.

161
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:38,769  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:524
A "moo" point?

162
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:43,566  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

163
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,967  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
It just doesn't matter.

164
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:50,772  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's "moo. "

165
00:09:57,053 --> 00:10:00,363  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
Have I been living with him
for too long, or did that make sense?

166
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:02,602  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't listen to Joey.

167
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,451  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, would you look at him?

168
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:07,292  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
He's obviously depressed.
He's away from his family.

169
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:11,287  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
What he needs right now is
for you to be his friend.

170
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:13,961  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.

171
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:17,961  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
- Fine, take their advice.

172
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:19,612  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:524
No one ever listens to me.

173
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:23,163  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
When the package is this pretty,
no one cares what's inside.

174
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:32,766  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
How you holding up?

175
00:10:33,173 --> 00:10:34,606  X1:288 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
Not bad.

176
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:37,964  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
- Thanks.

177
00:10:38,213 --> 00:10:42,252  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Were you guys together a long time?
- A year, on and off.

178
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:45,764  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:524
I thought we'd end up together.
I don't anymore.

179
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:48,362  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Now that she broke up with you.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:51,162  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's weird.

181
00:10:51,373 --> 00:10:55,605  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:446 Y2:524
I used to assume that I would meet
someone and fall in love and be happy.

182
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:59,726  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
That all that was just a given.
Lately, it's like, what if it's not?

183
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:02,125  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you ever have that feeling?

184
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,766  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

185
00:11:04,253 --> 00:11:05,368  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

186
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:08,568  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
All the time.
Constantly. It's terrifying.

187
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:11,930  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:524
But you know, then I figure
it has to work out.

188
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:13,848  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why?

189
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,564  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
Because it has to.

190
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:21,162  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You have all the answers, don't you?
- No, no, I do. I really do.

191
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,803  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Thanks for talking to me.
- Come on, what are bosses for?

192
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,372  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hug it out.

193
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:30,931  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, he likes you back.

194
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:35,763  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
Told you you should go for it.

195
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:38,292  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

196
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:43,650  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
Street noise drown any of that out?

197
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,328  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
No? See you later.

198
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,568  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

199
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:55,091  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
What did Joey say? I like you back?

200
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:03,328  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
Joey knows that I'm very insecure
about my back.

201
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:06,690  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
And you were hugging me...

202
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:10,892  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
...so obviously you are not
repulsed by it. Yeah!

203
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:15,485  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
- No?

204
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,967  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, here's the truth.

205
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:24,486  X1:177 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey said what he said...

206
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:27,891  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:524
...because I'm attracted to you.

207
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:30,282  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow.

208
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:31,886  X1:238 X2:476 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, I admit it.

209
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:37,088  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:524
I have a crush on you. I know that's
crazy because we work together...

210
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,925  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and nothing could ever happen.

211
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,488  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
The last thing I wanted to do
was freak you out...

212
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:44,526  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
...or make you feel uncomfortable.

213
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:49,085  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which is why it would be great
if you said something right about now.

214
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:52,692  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God.
Those guys are stealing my car.

215
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:53,928  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

216
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,408  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
Right there. That's my car!

217
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,848  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey!
- Okay, that'll take one minute.

218
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,521  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you have anything else to say?

219
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:02,922  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe it.

220
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:06,802  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
We still have time to talk,
and they're not even in the car yet.

221
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,884  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look, there they go.

222
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:13,086  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, Phoebe.
We should probably go back now.

223
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,882  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:524
Please, don't leave me.
I'll be lonely.

224
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:18,889  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:524
Stop it. Stop.

225
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,682  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
- Yeah, okay.

226
00:13:25,893 --> 00:13:28,407  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:448 Y2:524
Did you hear that?
She said, "Monica. "

227
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,887  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't leave her.

228
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:35,051  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:524
We could sneak the dog back
and Chandler wouldn't even know.

229
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:36,208  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:524
That won't work.

230
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:39,490  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
I've had that dog for three days,
and Chandler had no idea.

231
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,052  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's not so smart.

232
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,721  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey. I didn't know either.

233
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:48,085  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, but you kind of knew that
something was going on, didn't you?

234
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:49,972  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, I knew.

235
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:56,848  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:488 Y2:524
Where's Chandler?

236
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,522  X1:221 X2:494 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Here I am.
- Wash your hands.

237
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:04,332  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
How did you know?

238
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,289  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, what's she doing back here?

239
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:13,291  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
Relax, Ross.
She's not made of ice cream.

240
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:18,129  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, look, Phoebe.
I laid out the states geographically.

241
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,484  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:524
We don't have time.
We have to keep Chandler away.

242
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,481  X1:093 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah, but, look what...
- This is what we do not have time for!

243
00:14:29,973 --> 00:14:33,090  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Where's Monica?
- In Phoebe's room. You can't go in.

244
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,488  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why not?

245
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,805  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
Monica's crying.

246
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,922  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
She's very upset
about this whole Klunkers thing.

247
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,409  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Well, I should go in there.
- No, no.

248
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,690  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, she doesn't want to see
you right now.

249
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:54,692  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Why not?
- Because you sent away the dog.

250
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,047  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:448 Y2:524
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it? Is it?!

251
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:04,568  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, when Monica and I were kids,
we had a dog named Rover.

252
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:08,488  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
And one day, my dad decides
he doesn't like dogs.

253
00:15:08,693 --> 00:15:12,481  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
So Monica and her friend, Phyllis...

254
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:17,202  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:524
...take away the dog and that was the
last time we ever saw him. See?

255
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:20,086  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
This is just like that...

256
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:24,042  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
...only with a few details changed.

257
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,403  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.

258
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:30,881  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
Bring on the food.

259
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:39,084  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's the matter?
- Monica's upset because of Klunkers.

260
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,409  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
So? Bring the dog back.
You're a hero.

261
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:45,211  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yeah, I could be a hero.
I could do that.

262
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:47,569  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:524
What if it attacks me?

263
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:50,688  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

264
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,809  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
And that doesn't scare you?

265
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:01,291  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ross, you need some help?

266
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,086  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:484 Y2:524
From you?

267
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:05,885  X1:264 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, please.

268
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:13,489  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:486 Y2:524
First of all, Utah?

269
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,282  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.

270
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:24,489  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:524
I hate America!

271
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:28,085  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
When I finish this game,
I swear I am moving.

272
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:33,086  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Tag still talking to the police?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,727  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
Dammit. Why did I open my mouth?

274
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,533  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
"I have a crush on you.
I'm attracted to you. "

275
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:40,809  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know that I freaked him out.

276
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,810  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
If you said it like that, you did.

277
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:46,882  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, is Chandler here?

278
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,368  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, he went for a walk.

279
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,928  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, you cannot tell him,
but look who's back.

280
00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:55,972  X1:232 X2:482 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, no, no, no.

281
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:58,728  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:524
He went over to Ross' to bring
the dog back here.

282
00:16:58,933 --> 00:17:01,606  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, no, the dog's not going
to be there!

283
00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:04,482  X1:274 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
You think?

284
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:09,803  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi, honey.

285
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:12,932  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:524
Please, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

286
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,010  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What? Why would...?
- Wait and see.

287
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:17,408  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

288
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:21,803  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay, I went over to Ross'
to bring back Klunkers for you...

289
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:26,490  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and I left the door open,
and she must've gotten out.

290
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:31,052  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I looked everywhere, all over
the apartment, including the roof.

291
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:35,047  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which, FYI, Ross,
one of your neighbors, growing weed.

292
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:38,206  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:488 Y2:524
I couldn't find him...

293
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:42,207  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and I am so, so, so sorry.

294
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:46,810  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
But I do know where we can all go
ease the pain.

295
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,411  X1:080 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:524
We have good news. Look who's back!

296
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:56,126  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:524
Klunkers. Oh, my God!

297
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,804  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
- She came back all by herself.
- It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

298
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:04,882  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:524
It is so good to see you.

299
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,129  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:450 Y2:524
She came all the way back
from Ross'.

300
00:18:07,373 --> 00:18:09,967  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
The things she must've seen.

301
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:12,251  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
She climbed up the fire escape...

302
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:17,009  X1:097 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and tapped on the window with her
teeny paw, and we ran to let her in.

303
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,605  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:486 Y2:524
I went too far, didn't I?

304
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:23,404  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
When should I have stopped?

305
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:32,923  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, maybe this is so hard,
because there aren't 50 states.

306
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:38,009  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:524
Let me tell you something.
I have 49 states...

307
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:40,204  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and there are no more!

308
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,326  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
I think I should be able
to eat something.

309
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:46,442  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's up to you.

310
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:53,811  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, hi. How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

311
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:56,891  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got to go to the police station
and look at mug shots.

312
00:18:57,093 --> 00:18:58,242  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thanks for having me over.

313
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:00,609  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:524
Tag, you're going?

314
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:03,522  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
We didn't even get a chance to talk.

315
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:06,048  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
So where did you say
you're from again?

316
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:08,608  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Colorado.
- What good are you?

317
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,362  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, I think we should talk
about what happened on the terrace.

318
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:19,801  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

319
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,845  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:488 Y2:524
I never should've said what I said.

320
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,323  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
It just doesn't matter how I feel.

321
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:27,929  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
We work together, so nothing could
ever happen between us.

322
00:19:28,173 --> 00:19:32,849  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:446 Y2:524
I would love to go to work on Monday
and never talk about this again.

323
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:36,802  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay. Big day, Monday.
Lots to do.

324
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:38,327  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:524
So we okay?

325
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,603  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm not.

326
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,041  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:524
I freaked you out.

327
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:44,011  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, you didn't.

328
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:48,286  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
What freaked me out was you saying
nothing could happen between us.

329
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,488  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Really?
- Yeah.

330
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,732  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
So please don't fire me
for doing this.

331
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,447  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's one less thing
we have to do on Monday.

332
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:29,492  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:488 Y2:524
Delaware.

333
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:34,486  X1:280 X2:436 Y1:052 Y2:088
Delaware.

334
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,091  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:052 Y2:131
- All right.
- I want my turkey now.

335
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,086  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:052 Y2:093
You got it.

336
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:47,089  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:052 Y2:093
You got Nevada twice.

337
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:51,362  X1:290 X2:425 Y1:052 Y2:126
- I know.
- Yeah.

1
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:08,321  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'm ready.
- You sure?

2
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:11,172  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
Let me just straighten out
your helmet there.

3
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:14,887  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thanks, Daddy.
- No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

4
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:19,410  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:524
- All right, it's all yours.
- Okay, okay.

5
00:00:19,612 --> 00:00:21,330  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
There you go, there you go.

6
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:25,320  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike.
This is so exciting!

7
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,409  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

8
00:00:27,612 --> 00:00:30,001  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was my sixth birthday.
I went to the park...

9
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:33,522  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and I got on it and it bent.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:37,040  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I never had a bike of my own.
- What?

11
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:38,970  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
We didn't have a lot of money.

12
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,811  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
But the girl across the street
had the best bike.

13
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:46,244  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was pink and it had rainbow-colored
tassels hanging off the handles...

14
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:49,325  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and a bell
and this big, white wicker basket...

15
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:52,450  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
...with those
plastic daisies stuck on.

16
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:55,122  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
That sounds like my first bike.

17
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:58,250  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:524
My dad gave me his old one.

18
00:00:59,372 --> 00:01:01,442  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did the girl ever let you ride it?
- No.

19
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,927  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
But she gave me the box
that it came in.

20
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:07,131  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:450 Y2:524
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

21
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:11,725  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
So I would sit on it and my stepdad
would drag me around the backyard.

22
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:14,050  X1:232 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:524
That is so unfair.

23
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:17,125  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
Not really, I got
to drag him around too.

24
00:01:17,972 --> 00:01:20,008  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
The One With All the Candy

Hey, what are you guys doing?

27
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,843  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:052 Y2:093
Making candy for the neighbors.

28
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,281  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry, who?

29
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:08,763  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:052 Y2:127
I'm gonna hang
a basket on the door.

30
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:11,805  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:052 Y2:131
When the neighbors walk by,
they can take a piece.

31
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:15,288  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:052 Y2:127
- But we don't know the neighbors.
- I do.

32
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:18,529  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:052 Y2:132
There's, let's see,
the guy with the mustache...

33
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:21,929  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:052 Y2:126
...smokes-a-lot lady,
some kids I've seen...

34
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:26,006  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:052 Y2:131
...and the red-haired guy
who does not like to be called Rusty.

35
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:29,246  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:052 Y2:131
See, this is exactly why
I'm making this candy.

36
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,329  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:052 Y2:093
We can get to know our neighbors.

37
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:33,807  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wouldn't it be easier
if we just moved?

38
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,448  X1:247 X2:467 Y1:052 Y2:093
Good morning!

39
00:02:38,652 --> 00:02:41,849  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:052 Y2:132
- Somebody's in a good mood.
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

40
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:44,930  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:052 Y2:131
I have great friends.
I have a wonderful job...

41
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:48,044  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:052 Y2:131
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

42
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,367  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:052 Y2:094
It's not a big deal.

43
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:53,451  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:052 Y2:131
We stayed up creating a plan so
that us dating won't be a problem.

44
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,370  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?

45
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,769  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:524
We... We are not...

46
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:04,563  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
...going to let it...

47
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:06,364  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:524
...be a problem.

48
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,330  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
It took you all night
to come up with that plan?

49
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,841  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, you know,
we did other stuff too.

50
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,127  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you two...?

51
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:17,800  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, I don't sleep with guys
on the first date.

52
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:20,526  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise...
- Anymore!

53
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:30,443  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, Tag, I have a conference call
today, is that correct?

54
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:33,564  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Yes, at 4.
- Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

55
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:35,241  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wait, wait.

56
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:40,601  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you see that?

57
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:43,804  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
He had no idea there was
something going on between us.

58
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:54,528  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'd better get back to my desk.
- Okay, hard worker.

59
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,363  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll put that in your evaluation.

60
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,525  X1:083 X2:633 Y1:450 Y2:524
- My what?
- You've been here for two months now.

61
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:05,247  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
And your boss is required to hand in
a performance evaluation.

62
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:09,161  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaluate.

63
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:19,566  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you serious?
- No, but I've always wanted to do that.

64
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:21,964  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you help me clean this up?

65
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:30,644  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
The basket is totally empty!
The neighbors ate it all!

66
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:32,251  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, either that or... .

67
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:35,761  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey!

68
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:38,881  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah?

69
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:42,084  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
- That was the plan.

70
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:45,409  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
When I got to it,
there was only a few pieces left.

71
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:47,648  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
They've come by all day.
They love it.

72
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:50,362  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
They love my candy?

73
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:53,490  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
- Hey, Mon.

74
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:58,447  X1:070 X2:646 Y1:446 Y2:524
Make some more lasagna too. Something
might have happened to a chunk of it.

75
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,402  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.

76
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,125  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Mine stole my newspaper.

77
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:04,845  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's like a crime wave.

78
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,922  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:484 Y2:524
Pheebs, you got a second?

79
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:12,247  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sure.

80
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:15,361  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:524
Ever since you told me
about that bike...

81
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,682  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.

82
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:21,441  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
I mean, everyone should have
a first bike, you know? So... .

83
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:27,851  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God, Ross!

84
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:29,884  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You like it?
- I love it!

85
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:32,282  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Yeah?
- Oh, oh, God...

86
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,443  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I love you.

87
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:36,251  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:524
Not that way.

88
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:38,962  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
But the bike got you a lot closer.

89
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:41,330  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, take it downstairs.

90
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,284  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know, give it a test drive.

91
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:45,562  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. Oh, my God.

92
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,843  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:524
My first bike!

93
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:51,010  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

94
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,045  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're welcome.

95
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:57,322  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.

96
00:05:59,452 --> 00:06:00,646  X1:291 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:524
Am not.

97
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,201  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:488 Y2:524
Who is that?

98
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:08,451  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't worry, I'm brave.

99
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,882  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
l... I am brave.

100
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,090  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, no, no, no!

101
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:17,482  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you tell me who is there, please?

102
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:21,092  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.

103
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:24,560  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi.

104
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:27,889  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's candy time.

105
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:31,644  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
My roommate says they taste
like little drops of heaven.

106
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,649  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, please.

107
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,691  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
Did you hear that?
"Little drops of heaven. "

108
00:06:38,212 --> 00:06:39,691  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:524
Four a.m.

109
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,002  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
So can I get some candy?

110
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:46,291  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up early and go to work.

111
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:49,889  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
He does not know
that I am not "some of us. "

112
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:54,810  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
in the morning.

113
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:57,287  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, I'll swing by later.

114
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,284  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
You live in this building?

115
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,249  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
Seems like I'd remember you.

116
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,084  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Night, Gar.

117
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,202  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
So did you read your evaluation yet?

118
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:23,687  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, it was marked "confidential. "

119
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:25,843  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just sent it to human resources.

120
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:32,841  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
Please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

121
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,804  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
A joke they would appreciate?

122
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:37,287  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm thinking, no.

123
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:42,130  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What did you say?
- I said you were a good kisser...

124
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:46,484  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and that I liked your
teeny, tiny tushy.

125
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:49,528  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, not my tushy.

126
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:50,801  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
It gets worse.

127
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,048  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:524
About your initiative, I wrote:

128
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:56,449  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:524
"He was able to unhook my bra
with minimal supervision. "

129
00:07:57,692 --> 00:08:02,083  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
Under problems with performance,
I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not. "

130
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:06,565  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
And then... And then I drew
a little smiley face.

131
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:09,844  X1:091 X2:623 Y1:484 Y2:524
And then a small pornographic sketch.

132
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:21,570  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
That is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

133
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:23,967  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
When I heard the story,
I almost cried.

134
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:25,605  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:486 Y2:524
Almost cried, huh?

135
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,082  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:486 Y2:524
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

136
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:32,409  X1:147 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, you cry every time
somebody talks about <i>Titanic. </i>

137
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:35,081  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:484 Y2:524
Those two had only each other.

138
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,565  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
She really likes it, huh?

139
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,240  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, yeah. I saw her
walking it down the street.

140
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:43,410  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

141
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:46,291  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
I saw her this morning,
walking it by the park.

142
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,088  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait, she was walking the bike?

143
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,884  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
Both times?

144
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,208  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Oh, hi!

145
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:58,081  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
- Oh, uh-huh, so much.

146
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:03,641  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
Pheebs, you do know how
to ride a bike, don't you?

147
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,885  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
Of course.

148
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:09,931  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can we see you ride it?

149
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:11,685  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

150
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:26,971  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:524
See?

151
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:36,925  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
I told you not to get
involved with your assistant.

152
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:40,363  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
There's no such thing as a secret
when it comes to affairs.

153
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:43,243  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you hear that, Chandler?

154
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:45,331  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
No such thing.

155
00:09:46,932 --> 00:09:49,526  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:524
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

156
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,927  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
Maybe it's not that bad. They might
not take it the way I meant it.

157
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:58,681  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
Absolutely, you know?
Because "tushy" can mean both ass...

158
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,365  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and good worker.

159
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,123  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just gotta get the thing back.

160
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:06,209  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

161
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:08,926  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:524
Might it have looked
a little like this?

162
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,004  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God, Joey!

163
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:15,041  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What is the matter with you?
- God!

164
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:20,451  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
This little talent came in handy
before I could afford porn.

165
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:29,650  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's
after hours, but I really need candy.

166
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:33,004  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
See? Rules are rules.

167
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:36,090  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please, I have people coming
from out of town today.

168
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:39,045  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I told them all about your candy.
- You're kidding.

169
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:42,164  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
Out-of-towners, huh?
What did you tell them?

170
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:45,648  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
I told them your candy
was absolutely indescribable.

171
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:50,647  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
Some people have said it's "little
drops of heaven. " But whatever.

172
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:55,000  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Please, can't you help me out?
- Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?

173
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:59,091  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
Isn't she the woman who lives
below you and has sex really loud?

174
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,408  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, I'll do it just this once.

175
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:04,729  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:524
- But you can't tell anyone.
- Please, just give it to me.

176
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,002  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, that's her.

177
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:09,723  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable!

178
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:12,241  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't believe that sign didn't work.

179
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,330  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what would work?
Stop making candy.

180
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:17,486  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:524
But they like it.

181
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,645  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
You mean they like you.

182
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:21,887  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe.

183
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:25,369  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is that why you became a chef,
so people would like you?

184
00:11:25,572 --> 00:11:29,485  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
You want to talk about getting
people to like you, huh, funny man?

185
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:41,889  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just remember everything
I taught you and you'll be fine.

186
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,764  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay? Here we go.

187
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,803  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ready, set...

188
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:48,810  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait, this seat
is really uncomfortable.

189
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:52,044  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe before we start
we should just get another one.

190
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:55,528  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
Perhaps like an airplane seat,
or a beanbag chair!

191
00:11:56,412 --> 00:12:00,405  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:524
You can't get out of this.
You have to learn how to ride a bike.

192
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:03,410  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why? Why do I have to learn?

193
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:08,570  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Well, in case of an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

194
00:12:08,772 --> 00:12:13,050  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, what if a man comes along
and puts a gun to your head and says:

195
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:15,812  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:524
"You ride this bike or I'll...

196
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:18,401  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'll shoot you. "

197
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,042  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
I would ring the bell to distract him.

198
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:24,767  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
Then I would knock the gun away
with a Chinese throwing star.

199
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:29,009  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

200
00:12:29,252 --> 00:12:32,881  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and, hey, I'll hold you up
and push you. Okay?

201
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,645  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:524
You won't let go?

202
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,080  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:524
- No.
- You swear?

203
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,486  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:488 Y2:524
I swear.

204
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,004  X1:277 X2:439 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay.
- Come on.

205
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,405  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
Here we go. All right?

206
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:47,601  X1:285 X2:432 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right?

207
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,723  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
Feel good?
All right, try pedaling.

208
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:52,969  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:524
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take control.

209
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,367  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, yes, yes!

210
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,409  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no!

211
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:02,320  X1:269 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:524
You swore!

212
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:07,003  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I just thought you were doing so well.
- I am shocked. Shocked!

213
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,801  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a legitimate learning technique.

214
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,206  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow.

215
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:28,610  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hey, there's some people outside
asking about candy.

216
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:32,009  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
They'll just have to wait, okay?
I only got two hands!

217
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:35,410  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Need some help?
- No, you don't know the system.

218
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:38,001  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't need nobody messing
with the system!

219
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:42,725  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:446 Y2:524
By the way, the week before your
wedding, you may not see a lot of me.

220
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,564  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, hello, liar.

221
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:00,767  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:524
Look, I'm really sorry
I let go of the bike.

222
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:02,928  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:524
I could've been killed, you know.

223
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,530  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:524
I know, I know.

224
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:10,248  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
But can we please try it again?

225
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:12,722  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

226
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,400  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, I would love to...

227
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:19,249  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but the bike got stolen
and the police have no suspects.

228
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,640  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Phoebe.
- What?

229
00:14:29,612 --> 00:14:31,409  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:524
What the hell?

230
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:33,841  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:524
You know what?

231
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:37,044  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
If you won't learn how to ride,
then I'm sorry...

232
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,208  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
...I have to take it back.
- But why?

233
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:42,602  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:488 Y2:524
Because it's... .

234
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:46,723  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
It'd be like you having this guitar...

235
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:48,650  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and never playing it.

236
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:51,645  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

237
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,850  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:488 Y2:524
And this bike wants to be ridden.

238
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,242  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
And if you don't ride it...

239
00:14:57,492 --> 00:15:01,371  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
...you're killing its spirit.

240
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:04,520  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
The bike...

241
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,010  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:524
...is dying.

242
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:15,204  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right. If you care enough
to make up that load of crap, okay.

243
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:17,011  X1:303 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:524
Great.

244
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,448  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're making the bike very happy.

245
00:15:21,652 --> 00:15:22,846  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Ross.

246
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:27,404  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:524
Please don't die!

247
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,241  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
To get the evaluation
before they see it...

248
00:15:33,452 --> 00:15:37,809  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
...we gotta get into Zelner's office.
He doesn't get in until 10.

249
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:41,891  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
But his assistant, Betty, comes in
early to eat breakfast at her desk.

250
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:45,209  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

251
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,207  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which is why I believe I can lure
her away with these chocolates.

252
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,683  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
While I distract her, you go in.

253
00:15:52,892 --> 00:15:54,211  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Got it.
- Let's roll.

254
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:57,968  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hello, Rachel. You got a minute?

255
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:01,369  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

256
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:03,324  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, great.

257
00:16:03,572 --> 00:16:05,085  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:484 Y2:524
Abort the plan.

258
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:08,412  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
Actually, I'd like to speak
to both of you.

259
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:10,001  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

260
00:16:11,092 --> 00:16:15,370  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, can we get you anything,
Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.

261
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:19,491  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, thanks,
but I'll give these to Betty.

262
00:16:21,412 --> 00:16:24,006  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, I read your evaluation of Tag.

263
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:27,449  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
Or, to use his full name,
Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

264
00:16:29,132 --> 00:16:31,202  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is something going on with you two?

265
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:36,611  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

266
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:41,728  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, what would happen exactly?

267
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,241  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

268
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,046  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd have to consult
with the legal department.

269
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:51,403  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
And your future at the company
would be in jeopardy.

270
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,005  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Well...
- Mr. Zelner... .

271
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:56,762  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:524
I filled in that evaluation.

272
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,246  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, no...
- Yeah, yeah.

273
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:00,403  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought it would be funny.

274
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:04,405  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:484 Y2:524
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

275
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:06,881  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

276
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,447  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:488 Y2:524
I have a weird sense of humor.

277
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:12,081  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524
And I'm kind of strangely
proud of my butt.

278
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:15,608  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

279
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:18,806  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:446 Y2:524
What is this drawing?
I can't figure it out.

280
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:22,209  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's upside down, you gotta...
It doesn't matter.

281
00:17:23,572 --> 00:17:25,961  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's not like I don't have
a sense of humor.

282
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:29,608  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hell, I even enjoy a
naughty limerick every now and then.

283
00:17:32,132 --> 00:17:33,690  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
There's a time and a place.

284
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:38,206  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
Unless you have a limerick right now.

285
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,287  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
No? Okay.
Well, you've got my fax number.

286
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:54,480  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
I can't believe you did that.
That was sweet.

287
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:57,445  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Don't worry about it.
- You could've lost your job.

288
00:17:57,692 --> 00:18:00,764  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:524
Are you kidding me? With this
cute butt, I'd find work.

289
00:18:02,892 --> 00:18:04,769  X1:181 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:524
Thank you, you're great.

290
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:08,603  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You know what?
- What?

291
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:10,610  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:484 Y2:524
I feel great.

292
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:13,009  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:524
In fact... .

293
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:18,521  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

294
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:22,921  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's just... It took me so long
to get that desk organized.

295
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,010  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:27,923  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
There it is.

297
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:40,481  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
What is going on?

298
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:43,923  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy!

299
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:46,407  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, lady, give us candy.

300
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:48,881  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey!

301
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:51,842  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's up, buddy?
- What are you doing?

302
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,005  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
Waiting to get candy.

303
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,204  X1:266 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
Get in here.

304
00:18:57,492 --> 00:19:00,802  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

305
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:05,491  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas.

306
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:10,691  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:524
The candy is coming! I need
another 15 minutes for it to cool.

307
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:16,609  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right, everybody, just be quiet.
Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down!

308
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,848  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
What is the matter with you people?

309
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:22,044  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
This woman was trying to do a nice
thing for you.

310
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:25,562  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
She was making candy
so she could get to know all of you...

311
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:29,082  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and I'll bet that not one of you
can tell me her name.

312
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,691  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
Am I right?

313
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:33,169  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:524
Candy Lady?

314
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,642  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, not "Candy Lady. "

315
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:39,647  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
If we know it, can we have candy?

316
00:19:40,772 --> 00:19:42,444  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, you know what?

317
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:45,088  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
Forget it, you've ruined it.

318
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:47,248  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:524
Go home. You've ruined it.

319
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:51,047  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's all wrong! You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it!

320
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,046  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

321
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,081  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you smoke?

322
00:20:03,732 --> 00:20:08,931  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
directly into my mouth.

323
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,211  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you okay?

324
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:13,926  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:446 Y2:524
Fine, but it was
really scary for a while.

325
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:17,090  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:524
Someone slipped a threatening
note under the door!

326
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:21,046  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentality or whatever.

327
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:34,084  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:052 Y2:127
I can't believe it. I did it.
I rode a bike!

328
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:37,284  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:132
I never thought I'd be able
to do that. Thank you.

329
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:39,722  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:052 Y2:132
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

330
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:43,607  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:052 Y2:132
You're the one who faced your fears
and ultimately overcame them.

331
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:47,521  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:052 Y2:132
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special.

00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,369  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:524
I just got reservations
at Michelle's...

3
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,803  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and tickets to <i>The Music Man</i>
to celebrate...

4
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:11,328  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
...our first holiday
as a betrothed couple.

5
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:14,366  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:444 Y2:524
- "Betrothed. "
- Betrothed couple.

6
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:24,162  X1:291 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
Pheebs?

7
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:25,852  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Skull?

8
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:27,281  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, it's my mom's.

9
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:28,972  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:31,564  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

11
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:34,162  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
It belonged to my mom.

12
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,843  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

13
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:41,171  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

14
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:44,567  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
And you can put candy in it.

15
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:49,923  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:488 Y2:524
Licorice?

16
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:52,567  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sure.

17
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,370  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

18
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:59,041  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

19
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,965  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
I know Susan does every year.

20
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:03,926  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

21
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,725  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
And maybe I could teach Ben...

22
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,367  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

23
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:12,363  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:524
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

24
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,163  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

25
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,207  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

26
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:30,642  X1:298 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:524
Lovely.

You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, will you...

30
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:14,692  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:524

31
00:02:15,813 --> 00:02:16,962  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

32
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,403  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why not?

33
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,047  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:482 Y2:524
Bing's weird.

00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,970  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:052 Y2:093
Oh, hey, you guys.

35
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:30,888  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:052 Y2:131
My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

36
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,685  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:094
I guess I'll be moving out.

37
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:34,451  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:524
Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

38
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:36,484  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes, you will be very sad.

00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:41,966  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:052 Y2:131
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- You'll be living together again?

40
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:44,767  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Why not?
- She's having so much fun with Joey...

41
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:47,168  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:052 Y2:132
...I assumed she'd still
be living with him.

42
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:49,887  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:052 Y2:131
Why do you think
she's having so much fun?

43
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:52,288  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:052 Y2:093
No reason, except she...

44
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,171  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:052 Y2:088
...told me.

45
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:56,968  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:052 Y2:127
She said she didn't want
to live with me?

46
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,773  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:094
No. No, she didn't say that.

47
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:02,567  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:052 Y2:093
I think you should talk to Monica now.

48
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,562  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:052 Y2:132
Phoebe, I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:08,206  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're absolutely sure?

50
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:10,768  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:052 Y2:094
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

51
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:12,042  X1:254 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, probably?

52
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,521  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't like that word.

53
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:18,203  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:21,172  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself. "

55
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:25,008  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging my hopes...

56
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,847  X1:134 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably. "

57
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,561  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:524
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

58
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:32,968  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
History teaches us nothing.

59
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:38,087  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
Bing doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

60
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:44,523  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're home.

61
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:46,968  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas?

62
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,767  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Drums?
- No, drums!

63
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:06,007  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
Could we get
two burritos to go, please?

64
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:12,003  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
you don't have to live with it.

65
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,164  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:524
We have a reservation under Bing.

66
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:17,922  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

67
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,966  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:450 Y2:524
We have tickets
to <i>The Music Man</i> at 8.

68
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,846  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

69
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,164  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is this because of the burrito thing?

70
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,805  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You need to give him money.
- It was a joke!

71
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:35,563  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

72
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,970  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

73
00:04:41,013 --> 00:04:44,085  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth.

74
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,324  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, I can be smooth.

75
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,007  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're in a hurry.
If you could get us a table...

76
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:55,124  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
...a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it.

77
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,164  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

78
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:02,166  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

79
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:09,523  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:524
You don't feel...

80
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,564  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
...like you're gonna throw up?
- No.

81
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,769  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, I do. So let's... .

82
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:18,206  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, Ben, you... .

83
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:20,762  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know what holiday is coming up?

84
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:21,883  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
Christmas.

85
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,125  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

86
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,607  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
Christmas Eve.

87
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,361  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, but also... .

88
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,286  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hanukkah!

89
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:38,050  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
See, you're part Jewish
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

90
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:40,847  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

91
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:42,446  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Right, but on Hanukkah...

92
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:44,763  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

93
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:48,642  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
Years and years ago there were
these people called the Maccabees.

94
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,091  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, that's right. Yes...

95
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,483  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
...but on Hanukkah, we sing:

96
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,968  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, it's not a contest.

97
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:05,006  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
When is Santa coming?

98
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:09,563  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:524
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

99
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:12,373  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

100
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,365  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
No Santa?

101
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,052  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
Was I bad?

102
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:20,161  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, no, no, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

103
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:23,570  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

104
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:26,048  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

105
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:28,284  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're his favorite little guy.

106
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:29,892  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:524
So Santa's coming?

107
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:33,572  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes!

108
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,525  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:524
Santa's coming.

109
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:42,123  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

110
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,564  X1:078 X2:637 Y1:484 Y2:524
Shake his hand and give him the money.

111
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:48,726  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

112
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,563  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:486 Y2:524
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

113
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,363  X1:110 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:524
We'd be eating our soup right now.

114
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,568  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:488 Y2:524
Mustached bastard.

115
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:02,369  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
Those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

116
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,123  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
Excuse me.

117
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:33,249  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
So you like the drums.

118
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:35,290  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's great.

119
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,965  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was worried that
they would create maybe...

120
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:42,289  X1:135 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
...an unbearable living situation.

121
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,491  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

122
00:07:45,973 --> 00:07:47,804  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, we already learned a song.

123
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:51,170  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ready? One, two, three, four.

124
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,764  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:484 Y2:524
Tequila!

125
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:58,168  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's fun.

126
00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:05,968  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:484 Y2:524
Here you go.

127
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:08,170  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:524
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

128
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:13,561  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
Definitely not easier with coins.

129
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,126  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

130
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,002  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Pheebs.

131
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:22,972  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:524
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.

132
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:25,841  X1:249 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Pheebs...

133
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:29,688  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
...if you want to get Joey a gift
that disrupts the entire building...

134
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,889  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
...why not something more subtle...

135
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,361  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
...like a wrecking ball...

136
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:36,849  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
...or a vial of small pox
to release in the hallway?

137
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:39,846  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

138
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:42,243  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

139
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:45,291  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye! "

140
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,967  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I mean, it's so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

141
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:52,570  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

142
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,371  X1:087 X2:627 Y1:484 Y2:524
You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

143
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:58,968  X1:189 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

144
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,045  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe on some level.

145
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,285  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
You could just not throw the sticks
up in the air.

146
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,404  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

147
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,364  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

148
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,968  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is... .

149
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:27,812  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, what is it?

150
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:29,163  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's a...

151
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:30,641  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
...tarantula!

152
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:39,568  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:524
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

153
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:42,765  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:446 Y2:524
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

154
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:46,369  X1:102 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

155
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,521  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:450 Y2:524
What are you talking about?
I love them.

156
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:55,412  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

157
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:58,167  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
And then my cat died.

158
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,252  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

159
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:03,172  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

160
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,492  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, isn't that adorable?

161
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,645  X1:144 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

162
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,206  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's so adorable.

163
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:13,602  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's so much fun.

164
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,327  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm glad you're having
so much fun here.

165
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,682  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait a minute.

166
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:19,048  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's the matter?

167
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,286  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:524
Our apartment is ready.

168
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:25,847  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
And that makes you angry because...?

169
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:28,562  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:524
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

170
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,407  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

171
00:10:31,653 --> 00:10:33,848  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
...said you were having
so much fun here...

172
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:38,564  X1:098 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantula is gonna change that.

173
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:42,330  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you get all this stuff for Joey...

174
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,922  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to try to drive me out
of the apartment?

175
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:48,368  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
You might as well
have gotten him a fish.

176
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,808  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:488 Y2:524
You know how fish freak me out.

177
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,168  X1:313 X2:402 Y1:488 Y2:524
Fish.

178
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:57,610  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:524
But it wouldn't have mattered.
We're gonna live together.

179
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,172  X1:240 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's the deal.

180
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:01,973  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

181
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,681  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:524
But if you're having
so much fun over here...

182
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,930  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's so much more fun with you.

183
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,442  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We did.

184
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,926  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
They say, if we want,
we could see it tonight.

185
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,170  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

186
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,166  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

187
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:21,052  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:524
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

188
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,567  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Done.

189
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,688  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

190
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:44,963  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, these are my pants.

191
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,166  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

192
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:52,163  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
- How can I help you?
- Do you have a Santa outfit left?

193
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:54,603  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

194
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,362  X1:114 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, look.
Do you have anything Christmas-y?

195
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:02,043  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

196
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:05,171  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Come on, you gotta have something.

197
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:08,606  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

198
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,650  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm a friend of Santa's...

199
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:15,566  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and he sent me here to wish you...

200
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:18,771  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
...a merry Christmas!

201
00:12:19,493 --> 00:12:22,883  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

202
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:26,362  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:524
Santa was unavailable...

203
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:29,371  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:488 Y2:524
...so close to Christmas.

204
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,806  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:524
Come in, have a seat.

205
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:35,762  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

206
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,968  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

207
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:42,845  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm Santa's representative...

208
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:46,768  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:488 Y2:524
...for all the Southern states.

209
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,965  X1:261 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:524
And Mexico!

210
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:52,972  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:524
But Santa sent me here...

211
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:56,649  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
...to give you these presents, Ben.

212
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,965  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

213
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:15,968  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wow, thanks!

214
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,532  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:524
You're welcome, Ben.

215
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,963  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas.

216
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,964  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
And happy Hanukkah!

217
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:28,370  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

218
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,765  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
You are? Me too.

219
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:36,372  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

220
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:40,403  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:488 Y2:524
You want to wander in the hall?

221
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,170  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Ben!

222
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,443  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

223
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:50,049  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

224
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:51,208  X1:310 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:524
Cool!

225
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:52,966  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:486 Y2:524
Come on, Ben.

226
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,408  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
Years and years ago...

227
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,769  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
...there were these people called...

228
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,004  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:448 Y2:524
...the Maccabees!
- Ho, ho, ho!

229
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:05,926  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas!

230
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,365  X1:301 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:524
Santa!

231
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,806  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing here, Santa?

232
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,361  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy, Ben.

233
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,685  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing here...

234
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:24,562  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:524
...Weird Turtle Man?

235
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:29,092  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

236
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,484  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
...your part-Jewish friend.

237
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,568  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

238
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,570  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
Remember?

239
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:41,883  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

240
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:46,849  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

241
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,611  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:486 Y2:524
You bet I did, Ben.

242
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,769  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:524
Put her there.

243
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:59,769  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

244
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,892  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:486 Y2:524
Ho, ho, ho!

245
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,691  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ben, come open more gifts.

246
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:09,606  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
The armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

247
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:12,762  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

248
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:15,801  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing?

249
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:19,210  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
You said you were having trouble
finding a Santa costume...

250
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:21,683  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

251
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:24,282  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

252
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:25,892  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why?
- Because...

253
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,766  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:524
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

254
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,292  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
...and you're wrecking it.

255
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:34,367  X1:126 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:524
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

256
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:41,048  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

257
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:45,164  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

258
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:49,163  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

259
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:53,205  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
Santa, really?

260
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,081  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, is that okay?

261
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:58,810  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

262
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:03,164  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No.
- Then it's okay!

263
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:06,484  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

264
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,166  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:524
Say goodbye.

265
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,841  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, why does he have to go?

266
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:15,172  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

267
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:17,211  X1:255 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
...Armadillo...

268
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,568  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

269
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,771  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
...the universe will implode!

270
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,563  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas!

271
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:33,602  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

272
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:37,571  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:524
Fine, I give up. Santa...

273
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:40,202  X1:241 X2:473 Y1:484 Y2:524
Santa can stay!

274
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,048  X1:242 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I'll stay...

275
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,649  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:524
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

276
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,882  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

277
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,169  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and learn about Hanukkah?

278
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,364  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, Santa.

279
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,812  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

280
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:59,009  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:524
All right, it's time...

281
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:02,370  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:524
...for the story of Hanukkah.

282
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:04,611  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
Years and years ago...

283
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:08,448  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:524
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

284
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:11,009  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Merry Christmas!

285
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:23,767  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, wow, look at this place!

286
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,969  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, this is terrible.

287
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,811  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
They've made so many changes...

288
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:32,971  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

289
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,569  X1:227 X2:489 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, new sconces!

290
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,171  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my God!
- What?

291
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:42,289  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
Remember how you told me
your grandmother put up that wall...

292
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,603  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:524
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

293
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:47,003  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
And that the landlord
might find out...

294
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,244  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

295
00:17:50,093 --> 00:17:52,129  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you really not know
where I'm going?

296
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,411  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
It left. It's one huge room.

297
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,564  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no!

298
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,569  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow!

299
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:03,482  X1:312 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:524
See?

300
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:06,243  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
I guess we'll have to
put the wall back up.

301
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:10,571  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You can't, with the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

302
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:12,970  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow!

303
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:16,445  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
So should we start looking
for a new place?

304
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,241  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know, I'm sensing...

305
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:25,202  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:524
...that my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

306
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,088  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah?

307
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,847  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

308
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:33,365  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:450 Y2:524
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

309
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,322  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is your grandmother maybe saying
that you should live here alone?

310
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,649  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
You heard it too? You have the gift.

311
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,364  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:524
Phoebe, it's okay.

312
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,370  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
I like living with Joey.

313
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:48,968  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

314
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,492  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:488 Y2:524
...it's closer to work.

315
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:52,571  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:524
And we do have fun.

316
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:57,084  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:524
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

317
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,768  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

318
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,561  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you hear that?

319
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:05,281  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

320
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:09,009  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
She said since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

321
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:12,250  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

322
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:16,565  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, I do not hear that.

323
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:21,205  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:524
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

324
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:25,088  X1:164 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for... .

325
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:27,124  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

326
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:31,087  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

327
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,164  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

328
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,642  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
My favorite part...

329
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:38,966  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

330
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:46,487  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

331
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:50,568  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

332
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,606  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:488 Y2:524
...the Hanukkah candles!

333
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:07,772  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

334
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:12,972  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

335
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,370  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
I understand why Superman is here...

336
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:22,969  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

337
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,888  X1:268 X2:449 Y1:052 Y2:131
- You get it?
- I got it.

338
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,771  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:052 Y2:093
Back in the cage?

339
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,850  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:052 Y2:094
It's back in the cage.

340
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:39,811  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:052 Y2:093
Is the cage closed?

341
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:45,162  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:052 Y2:131
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby!

00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,322  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
Ross, when's this comet thing start?

2
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:11,207  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, technically, it started
7 billion years ago.

3
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,645  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay. Fine, I'll stop.
No teaching, okay?

4
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:18,521  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
We'll just watch the pretty light
streaking across the sky.

5
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:20,131  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay?

6
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:24,810  X1:097 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
Whose official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!

7
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:29,609  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:486 Y2:524
There it is. Oh, look at that!

8
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,610  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:524
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?

9
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:36,005  X1:245 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's a plane.

10
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:40,647  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, all right, 1 700 bags
of peanuts flying that high...

11
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:42,564  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
...that's pretty amazing too.

12
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:48,162  X1:086 X2:629 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I wonder if you can see my apartment.
- No, you can't.

13
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,766  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What?
- I don't know.

14
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:55,602  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:486 Y2:524
Man, look at all those stars.

15
00:00:55,812 --> 00:01:00,761  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
Infinite space. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

16
00:01:01,052 --> 00:01:03,247  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Know what else makes you wonder?
- What?

17
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:05,966  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:524
Check out the rack on that chick.

We've been out here for two hours...

21
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:53,923  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:132
...and we haven't seen any
stupid comets. Can we go now?

22
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:57,283  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.

23
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:02,284  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:052 Y2:091
No, I'm not.

24
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:05,967  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:052 Y2:131

Monica's jacket?

25
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,280  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:052 Y2:094
Because it's flattering!

26
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:12,887  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:052 Y2:090
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.

27
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:17,288  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We're going too. We got a movie.
- I won't say no to a movie.

00:02:17,492 --> 00:02:20,131  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, Pheebs, we just actually
wanted to be alone.

00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:22,402  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Sh. Get me out of here.
- Oh, okay.

30
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:27,081  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Hey, Ross.
- What?

31
00:02:27,292 --> 00:02:28,884  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Check it out.
- Is it the comet?

32
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:33,007  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:524
No. Look, there's a bug
stuck in tar right here.

33
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:35,201  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:052 Y2:089
I can't believe...

34
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,801  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:052 Y2:131
I bring you to see
the Bapstein-King comet...

35
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:40,446  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:052 Y2:132
...one of nature's
most spectacular phenomena...

36
00:02:40,652 --> 00:02:45,009  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:052 Y2:126
...and all you care about are bugs
stuck in tar and some woman.

37
00:02:47,812 --> 00:02:50,372  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:052 Y2:091
You know, there's two women, dude.

38
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:53,165  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
Show me where.

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,963  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:052 Y2:093
Okay. Right up here.

40
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:04,809  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
Joey, where's the pipe
that was holding the door open?

41
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,206  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know.

42
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,008  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, I do.

43
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:20,648  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joey!
- What? Hey, don't look at me!

44
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:25,403  X1:094 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:524
You wanted to come up here and look
for some stupid Burger King comet.

45
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:29,330  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's called the
Bapstein-King comet, okay?

46
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:32,882  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, Bapstein was a very
well-respected astronomer from...

47
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,645  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No!

48
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:47,409  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Monica.
- She's sleeping.

49
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,287  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
I know. Just a quick question.

50
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:56,650  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which one was <i>Deep Impact</i>
and which one was <i>Armageddon</i>?

51
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:02,045  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
<i>Deep Impact</i> was the one
with Robert Duvall.

52
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:05,767  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:524
<i>Armageddon</i> is what's going
to happen to you if you wake me up.

53
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:09,848  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
Sorry, I just can't sleep.

54
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:18,445  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:524
Where's that book you're reading
with two women who are ice-skating...

55
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:21,086  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and wearing those hats
with the flowers on it.

56
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,250  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:524
Because every time I look
at that cover, I'm like...

57
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:29,404  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's in the living room,
where there's also a light...

58
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,682  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and no one will
kick you in the shin.

59
00:04:33,292 --> 00:04:34,441  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

60
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:49,449  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:524
Please don't be a spaceship.
Please don't be a spaceship.

61
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,650  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, thank God.

62
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,045  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
How could you be beeping?
I just disconnected you!

63
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:38,245  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
I took out your battery! How can...?
Don't interrupt me!

64
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:42,290  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica! Monica!

65
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,045  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:488 Y2:524
Come on!

66
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,962  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe this!

67
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:53,251  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right, well, I guess we know
what we have to do to get down.

68
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,522  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.

69
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:59,449  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
Help us! Please, help us!

70
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:03,691  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're stuck up on the roof,
and we can't get down!

71
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,447  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ross.

72
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:10,451  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:524
I was thinking we'd just
go down the fire escape.

73
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:14,168  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know. I wasn't finished.

74
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:19,242  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:524
But don't worry!

75
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,248  X1:092 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're gonna go down the fire escape!

76
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:33,840  X1:321 X2:393 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sh!

77
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:41,850  X1:091 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm milk and it would help me sleep.

78
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,326  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
With a wok?

79
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,572  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:524
My boring book didn't
put you to sleep?

80
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,047  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
It got interesting.

81
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,243  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
Damn you, Oprah!

82
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:56,085  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
Here, let me make the milk.
I'm up anyway.

83
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,681  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what we could do
now that we're up?

84
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:01,531  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
We could just talk
to each other all night long.

85
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,121  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
Like when we were first dating.
It'd be fun.

86
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:06,090  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, that does sound fun.
- Yeah.

87
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:09,643  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:448 Y2:524
So how bummed were you
when the second sister died, huh?

88
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,683  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:524
The second sister dies?!

89
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,771  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

90
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,405  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, I was talking
about the book I was reading.

91
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:26,525  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:446 Y2:524
The second sister dies in
<i>Archie and Jughead Double Digest</i>?

92
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:29,727  X1:247 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's correct.

93
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:38,931  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's more comfortable.

94
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:40,770  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Sure.
- Okay.

95
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:45,449  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, wait, did you send
those contracts to Milan?

96
00:07:46,572 --> 00:07:49,166  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
If this is your idea of sexy talk... .

97
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:52,560  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
Did you overnight
the contracts I gave you?

98
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,602  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:524
What contracts?

99
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:57,521  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please tell me this is just one
of your jokes that I don't get.

100
00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:58,801  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Like what?

101
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:01,970  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
Like the thing when you
put the phone in your pants?

102
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:05,802  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:444 Y2:524
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.

103
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,480  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
Those contracts had to go out today.

104
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,603  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
You didn't give me any contracts.

105
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,770  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yes, I did. I put a little
Post-it on it that said:

106
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:17,647  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Must go out today," and I
underlined "today" three times.

107
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:22,164  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
Then I put a little heart in the
corner so I wouldn't seem too bossy.

108
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,404  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:524
You never gave them to me.

109
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:29,128  X1:085 X2:633 Y1:446 Y2:524
If we went to the office, you would see
those contracts sitting on your desk.

110
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:33,211  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, I'd see you looking embarrassed
because they are not on my desk.

111
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:37,928  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:524
Maybe I'm embarrassed because you
talk on the phone with your crotch.

112
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:40,888  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to go to the office now?

113
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:44,164  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
Come on, it's late.
We're not going down to the office.

114
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:48,001  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't
want to be proved wrong either.

115
00:08:48,252 --> 00:08:50,368  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, get your coat!

116
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:55,411  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh! When did you unhook this?
Nice work!

117
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:05,965  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:524
It won't go down any further.
It's stuck.

118
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,570  X1:187 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
We'll just have to jump.

119
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:12,972  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
Now, we're gonna have
to make sure to land...

120
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:16,409  X1:209 X2:511 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to the right of that
patch of ice, okay?

121
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:20,167  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:524
Not hit the dumpster
on the other side.

122
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:25,971  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
And try to avoid that weird
brownish-red stuff in the middle.

123
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:29,566  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
So when you get down there...

124
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:36,162  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
...you go up to the roof
and you let me in.

125
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:39,610  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wait a minute. I have to do it?
- You'll be fine.

126
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,372  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'll be just like
bungee jumping, you know?

127
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:46,565  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
But instead of bouncing back up,
you won't.

128
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:51,765  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, what if I smack
my head on the concrete?

129
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:55,362  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey.
It's a possibility.

130
00:09:58,372 --> 00:10:01,728  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know. Tell you what,
let's flip to see who does it.

131
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:04,765  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You call it in the air, all right?
- Oh, all right.

132
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:12,009  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Can you see what it is?
- No.

133
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:15,363  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay. Well, you be careful.
- No, Ross, stop it.

134
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:16,647  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm not jumping.

135
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:20,811  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
and I can't go if I break my leg.

136
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:25,449  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
He won't have a father if I die.

137
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,449  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:488 Y2:524
So it looks like we're even.

138
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,171  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, so this wire...

139
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:39,161  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
...is connected to this wire,
which plugs into here.

140
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:43,771  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
all I have to do... .

141
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:46,366  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

142
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,570  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well done, Pheebs.

143
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:03,968  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do you want from me?!

144
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:10,206  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
Here's your milk.
What should we talk about?

145
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,884  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:488 Y2:524
What? What? What?

146
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:19,370  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry. Here.

147
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:25,965  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. Feel free to look...

148
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,931  X1:153 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
...but I'm telling you
those contracts are not here.

149
00:11:29,132 --> 00:11:31,600  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:446 Y2:524
How could you know?
Look at this mess, Tag.

150
00:11:31,812 --> 00:11:34,849  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
This is what I'm saying.
You have to be more organized.

151
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:38,840  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
You've got newspapers,
you've got magazines, you... Oh!

152
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:41,647  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
And who's this chippy?

153
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,402  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
A little young for you, but whatever.

154
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,681  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's my sister.

155
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:49,371  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? Very cute braces.

156
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:53,324  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start looking...

157
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:56,649  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:524
...because you're gonna find
those contracts on your desk.

158
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:02,041  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
So when do you imagine you gave
them to me? Morning or afternoon?

159
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:06,245  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner
came into my office after lunch...

160
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:09,762  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
...he put them on my desk,
and then I put a Post-it on it...

161
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,721  X1:269 X2:448 Y1:488 Y2:524
...that said:

162
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,841  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Must go out today. "

163
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:20,485  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
So you just keep looking
in there, all right?

164
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:27,971  X1:230 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:524
They're not here.

165
00:12:29,172 --> 00:12:30,571  X1:294 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
Puzzler.

166
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:35,564  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:484 Y2:524
Bit of a puzzle.

167
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:39,607  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't you check the copy room?
Maybe the contracts are in there.

168
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:42,565  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How could I have left them there?
- I don't know.

169
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,127  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:446 Y2:524
How can your genitals
make phone calls?

170
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:49,443  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay? It's not a perfect world.
Just go, please?

171
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:52,163  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Fine.
- Thank you.

172
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,370  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hello?

173
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:11,806  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:524
I still don't get it.

174
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:17,964  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:524
You still awake?

175
00:13:18,372 --> 00:13:20,090  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. You?

176
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,965  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
You do know that was me
that just said that, right?

177
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,200  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

178
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:31,170  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
As long as we're both up... .

179
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,731  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah?

180
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:39,642  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
I hope you're not thinking
about cleaning the living room.

181
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:47,567  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
Man, I'm starving. What the hell
was I thinking at dinner?

182
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:51,162  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Do you want soup or salad?"
Both, always order both.

183
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:57,245  X1:093 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:524
You know, I'm looking,
and I don't think anyone's home here.

184
00:13:57,452 --> 00:14:00,012  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
I say we just break the window...

185
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:01,406  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
...crawl through...

186
00:14:01,612 --> 00:14:03,887  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and you know, explain later.

187
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,889  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:450 Y2:524
- No one's home?
- I don't think so.

188
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:07,161  X1:305 X2:412 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hello?

189
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:16,365  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
So when you get in there... .

190
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:27,171  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay. This is where
you and I part ways.

191
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:28,561  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Noisy bitch!

192
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,806  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, what? What are you doing?

193
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,368  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you know what just happened?

194
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:43,161  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah. We had sex
and then we fell asleep.

195
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,362  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:488 Y2:524
No. We were in the middle of sex...

196
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:51,560  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and you fell asleep.

197
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:55,809  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:486 Y2:524
No. No, that's not true.

198
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,168  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, best time ever.

199
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,570  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah. You rock my world.

200
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,163  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Monica?
- What?

201
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:10,808  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was giving you some of
my best moves, and you missed it.

202
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:15,364  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
So please wake up
so we can do it right.

203
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:19,160  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

204
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,363  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Come on, big fella.
- Okay.

205
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,563  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Give me the good stuff.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:28,167  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.

207
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:32,369  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay, I'm going
to make you some coffee.

208
00:15:34,252 --> 00:15:38,370  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I probably won't spill coffee
grounds all over the kitchen floor.

209
00:15:38,612 --> 00:15:40,170  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.

210
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:46,369  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hi. I got you some coffee to...

211
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,770  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:484 Y2:524
So you got anything for me?

212
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:50,724  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Still no luck.
- Oh, my God.

213
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:53,605  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:524
You checked your entire desk
and all the drawers?

214
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,201  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Want me to check again?
- I wish you would.

215
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,970  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, no, it's not in there.

216
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:01,920  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:524
How about that drawer?

217
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:12,766  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, it's not out here.
Any chance it could be in your office?

218
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,370  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know.

219
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,125  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:486 Y2:524
I mean, let me check.

220
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,171  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:524
Any luck?

221
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:36,682  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
See you in my office for a minute?

222
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:41,289  X1:234 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:524
You found them!

223
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:45,130  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm not even gonna gloat.

224
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:48,449  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm just really relieved it's...
- You put these on my desk.

225
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:49,767  X1:270 X2:448 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I did not.
- Oh, really?

226
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:51,724  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:484 Y2:524
So they left your bottom drawer...

227
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:54,730  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
...crawled across the floor,
then jumped onto my desk?

228
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,571  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:446 Y2:524
How did you know
they were in my bottom drawer?

229
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,082  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
I am so hot for you right now.

230
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:20,127  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God!
How did you get back here?

231
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,050  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe Buffay?

232
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,044  X1:271 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
Fire Alarm?

233
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:34,641  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.
Can I help you?

234
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:36,683  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
Your fire alarm was in the trash.

235
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,684  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:448 Y2:524
- That's not mine.
- Yes, it is.

236
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:39,688  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
How do you know?

237
00:17:39,932 --> 00:17:42,810  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you dump a fire alarm,
don't use a blanket that says:

238
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:45,850  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
"Property of Phoebe Buffay,
not Monica. "

239
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,450  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do you have a search warrant?

240
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,962  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
Because the last time I checked,
this was still America.

241
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,930  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please reattach it.
It's illegal to disconnect them.

242
00:17:56,132 --> 00:18:00,045  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
Fine. But please, God, tell me
how to stop it from going off?

243
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,765  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:488 Y2:524
Press the reset button.

244
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:05,442  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

245
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,405  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh. There's a reset button?

246
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,563  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
My God!

247
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:12,962  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why didn't I see that?

248
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:17,080  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:524
Reset button. Reset button.

249
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:20,369  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:448 Y2:524
Where is there a reset button?
Oh, here it is! Oh!

250
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:40,766  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, you have a good grip?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:43,691  X1:081 X2:634 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm gonna start to climb down you now.

252
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,443  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
- All right, just hurry up.
- Okay.

253
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:51,928  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
Now, should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

254
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,488  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
...or should I climb down
your back so we're...

255
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,364  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:488 Y2:524
...butt to face?

256
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:00,927  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Face to face.
- I like face to face.

257
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:04,485  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

258
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:10,211  X1:067 X2:650 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?

259
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:16,087  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
I prefer not to answer. I'm still
carrying a little holiday weight.

260
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,522  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:488 Y2:524
When we talked about face to face...

261
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:28,485  X1:158 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I don't think we thought it
all the way through.

262
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:32,767  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What do you want me to do?
- Just shimmy down me and drop.

263
00:19:37,812 --> 00:19:39,291  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hi.

264
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:44,442  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, maybe I should hang,
and you should climb down me.

265
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:48,088  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yeah? Maybe we should talk
about that for a little while!

266
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:53,007  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
- It still looks pretty far.
- It's not that far. Just drop.

267
00:19:53,212 --> 00:19:54,884  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:524
Do not rush me!

268
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:07,123  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
My pants are starting to come down,
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

269
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:14,881  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
My ankle! I really hurt my ankle!

270
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:18,488  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
I think I twisted it when...
A quarter!

271
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,041  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:052 Y2:131
That really was
some of your best work.

272
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:27,844  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:052 Y2:093
I told you.

273
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:32,487  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:052 Y2:089
I can't believe it.

274
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:36,651  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:127
I've only got two hours
until I call in sick for work.

275
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,048  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:052 Y2:093
I have to be up in seven minutes.

276
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:44,045  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:052 Y2:132
Well, you're not gonna believe this,
but if you have seven minutes... .

277
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:46,245  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:052 Y2:093
Really?

278
00:20:46,732 --> 00:20:48,085  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:052 Y2:088
You want to?

279
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,602  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:131
You get the vacuum cleaner.
I'll get the furniture polish.

1
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:05,920  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:10,125  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What are you doing?
- I was thinking of moving the couch.

3
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:11,651  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why would you want to do that?

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:14,161  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:524
So there'd be a decent place
for me to sit?

5
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:19,491  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Rach, there is a decent place.
- And your lap does not count.

6
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:23,852  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Come on, help me move this.
- No, no, no.

7
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,321  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:450 Y2:524
- No?
- No.

8
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,170  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:524
Rosita does not move.

9
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:32,446  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...?

10
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:34,882  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:488 Y2:524
As in "Rosita does not move. "

11
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:37,168  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's just a chair.
What's the big deal?

12
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:40,682  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's the exact equal distance
from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:45,801  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and it's at an angle where you
don't get any glare coming off Stevie.

14
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,170  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
Stevie the TV?

15
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:52,249  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Is there a problem?
- No.

16
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:56,646  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:488 Y2:524
What does he know?

17
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:59,929  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
Come on, Rosita.
Us <i>chicas</i> gotta stick together.

18
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,641  X1:276 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
You bitch!

19
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:14,562  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One Where Rosita Dies

00:01:48,252 --> 00:01:49,207  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Ross?

22
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,761  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:088
I checked the real estate section.

23
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:53,647  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look at this.

24
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:55,524  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:052 Y2:089
Looks like Mom and Dad's house.

25
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:59,003  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:126
Even has a tree
with a broken limb out front.

26
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,927  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:052 Y2:088
And the window in the attic... .

27
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:05,288  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:052 Y2:093
Oh, my God!

28
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:08,610  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:052 Y2:126
What happened
to the window in the attic?

29
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:13,080  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:052 Y2:132
- I can't believe they're selling it.
- And they didn't tell us.

30
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:15,760  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:052 Y2:126
What happened
to the window in the attic?

31
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,649  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:052 Y2:094
I'll buy you a new one, okay?

32
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:23,168  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:052 Y2:132
We'll go to the store and get you
a new chair right now.

33
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:28,766  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
She's not even cold yet.

34
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:33,364  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:052 Y2:132
Wouldn't Rosita have
wanted you to move on?

35
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,890  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:052 Y2:131
I mean, you know, she did always
put your comfort first.

36
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:41,365  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:052 Y2:089
That's true.

37
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:49,287  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe we have to say goodbye
to the house we grew up in.

38
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:52,245  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:524
Man, some stranger's gonna be
in my room.

39
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:55,251  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
For 15 years they kept it
as a shrine to you.

40
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,841  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's time the velvet ropes came down.

41
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,445  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:524
They kept your room a while.

42
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:05,043  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
Please! Dad turned my room into
a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

43
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:09,251  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack
of Victoria's Secret catalogs?

44
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:10,771  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Not a gym.

45
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:14,842  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Come on. You know they love you.
- As much as they love you?

46
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:18,965  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
They thought she was barren
until I was born. It's not my fault.

47
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:23,850  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
I hate this year.

48
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:25,644  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's wrong with this year?

49
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:29,003  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's February and I've only
given two massages...

50
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:31,442  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and they were both horrible tippers.

51
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:32,926  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:524
That was me and Ross.

52
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:37,008  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, that's right.

53
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,051  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
If you want some extra cash...

54
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:42,682  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
...some college friends made
good money doing telemarketing.

55
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,925  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'd be better than the last
telephone job I had.

56
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:48,925  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:524
I probably won't have to say
"spank" as much.

57
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,531  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

58
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:56,652  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah, like you never called.

59
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:05,845  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is very easy.
You read from the script...

60
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,606  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and try to sell as much
toner as you can.

61
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,404  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I can do that.

62
00:04:10,652 --> 00:04:13,803  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:484 Y2:524
By the way, I love my office.

63
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:17,010  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Why don't we do a trial run?
- Oh, okay.

64
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,406  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right.

65
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:23,412  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, this is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

66
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:27,486  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Can I speak to your supply manager?
- I'm the supply manager.

67
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,922  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd like to talk
about your toner needs.

68
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:31,008  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:524
We don't need any.

69
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:33,203  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

70
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,566  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

71
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:38,645  X1:089 X2:629 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. What was wrong with that call?

72
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:40,171  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, well, all right.

73
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:43,688  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
No offense,
but you were kind of rude.

74
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,885  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
They always say they
don't need toner. That's okay.

75
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:52,489  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
Whatever they say, you can find the
answer to it, here in the script.

76
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:55,081  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:524
So I think you're ready to sell toner.

77
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,283  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Do you have any last questions?
- No.

78
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:59,727  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait, yes, I do have one question:

79
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:01,451  X1:248 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
What is toner?

80
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:05,885  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey?

81
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:08,881  X1:312 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
Joe?

82
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:14,890  X1:286 X2:431 Y1:484 Y2:524
Full bag?

83
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,682  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
Beer's still cold.

84
00:05:20,372 --> 00:05:23,330  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
Something terrible
must have happened here.

85
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,203  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no, no, no!

86
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:38,492  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:486 Y2:524
Stevie, I was never here.

87
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,800  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Dad?
- I'm here!

88
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,891  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hi.

89
00:05:47,092 --> 00:05:51,210  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:524
Seems like just yesterday you guys
used to come out to watch me work.

90
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,687  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:524
We can't believe
you're selling the house.

91
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:55,689  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:524
Time for a new family
to start here.

92
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:59,004  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
I hope their check clears before
they find the crack...

93
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:01,931  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
...in the foundation
and the asbestos in the ceiling.

94
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:06,525  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:524
Let's grab our stuff and
get the hell out of here.

95
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:10,328  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Sorry we can't store your things.
- Oh, it's okay.

96
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,642  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't wait to see everything again.

97
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:14,723  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know what's down here.

98
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:18,481  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524
But there are six or seven
Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

99
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:21,408  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
I used to love to play restaurant.

100
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:24,570  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
Not as much as you loved to play
"uncooked batter eater. "

101
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,970  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't expect a child to wait
for a light bulb to cook brownies.

102
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:34,006  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
So I think your boxes are over here.

103
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:35,565  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, great.

104
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,410  X1:305 X2:411 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey...

105
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:39,568  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
...whose cigarettes are these?

106
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:43,523  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know.

107
00:06:43,772 --> 00:06:46,047  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:524
They must be your mother's.

108
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:50,808  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
But please, please don't ask her.
I'll throw these away.

109
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:57,843  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
Cool! Dad, my report cards!

110
00:06:58,092 --> 00:06:59,411  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, check this out.

111
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:04,606  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
Math, "A. " Science, "A. "
History, "A. " Gym... .

112
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:13,045  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
My rock polisher!

113
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,568  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Uh-oh.
- What?

114
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,888  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know how the garage
floods every spring?

115
00:07:21,132 --> 00:07:24,090  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
How are you ever gonna sell
this place?

116
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:27,006  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:524
I think I accidentally
used Monica's boxes...

117
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:29,561  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
...to keep the water away
from the Porsche.

118
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:35,244  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?

119
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:36,402  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
What the...

120
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:40,804  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, God.
Everything's ruined!

121
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,168  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.

122
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:47,008  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
You don't secretly smoke, do you?

123
00:07:48,772 --> 00:07:49,602  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

124
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:52,567  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:524
So it's just your mother then.

125
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:59,048  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

126
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:02,050  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can I speak to your
supply manager, please?

127
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:04,969  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
Earl. Thanks.

128
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,486  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe
from Empire Office Supplies.

129
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:12,200  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd like to talk to you
about your toner needs.

130
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,802  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't need any toner.

131
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:20,409  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
I hear what you're saying, but at
our prices, everyone needs toner.

132
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:23,126  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Not me.

133
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:25,170  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:524
May I ask why?

134
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,806  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to know why?

135
00:08:28,492 --> 00:08:29,766  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to know why?

136
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:31,803  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
I surely do.

137
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:33,441  X1:307 X2:408 Y1:484 Y2:524
<i>Okay. </i>

138
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,652  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't need any toner...

139
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,848  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
...because I'm gonna kill myself.

140
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,612  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:524
Is that because you're out of toner?

141
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:02,406  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, so no toner today.
Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

142
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,964  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wait, wait! I can't let you hang up.
Just please talk to me.

143
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,561  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well... .

144
00:09:09,812 --> 00:09:11,643  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
I only had one thing to do today.

145
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:17,371  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
I guess I could push it back.

146
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:20,406  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah. Now, why do you
want to kill yourself?

147
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:24,850  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:524
I've been working for 10 years
now at this...

148
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:27,048  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
...meaningless, dead-end job...

149
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,250  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and nobody here
even knows that I exist.

150
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:32,851  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler?

151
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:39,208  X1:279 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry?

152
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:42,051  X1:298 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look...

153
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,686  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I'm sure that people know
you exist.

154
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,923  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle...

155
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:48,571  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
...surrounded by people.

156
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:52,805  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:524
I've been talking to you for five
minutes now about killing myself...

157
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:56,529  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and no one's even looked up
from their desk. Hang on.

158
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:58,450  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, everybody...

159
00:09:58,652 --> 00:10:00,085  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I'm gonna kill myself.

160
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:05,840  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:524
I got nothing.

161
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,564  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:524
Good chair.

162
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,611  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:484 Y2:524
Now, if anybody asks...

163
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:15,491  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:484 Y2:524
...your name is Rosita.

164
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:40,650  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

165
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,760  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:524
Joey, the new chair
will be here in an hour.

166
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,440  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
Maybe we should move
Rosita out of here.

167
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:49,847  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:524
Start the healing process.

168
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:52,450  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, I guess you're right.

169
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:14,968  X1:255 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
She's healed!

170
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:19,928  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's weird.

171
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,525  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, it's not weird.

172
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,245  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's a miracle!

173
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:27,170  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not a miracle. I'm sure
there's an explanation.

174
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:31,411  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
There is. If your heart is pure,
wondrous things can happen.

175
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:36,412  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
She'll understand.
I didn't do it on purpose.

176
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,125  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:486 Y2:524
Dad, that won't matter to her.

177
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:40,602  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.

178
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:42,251  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:524
And all her stuff is...

179
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:45,211  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
...growing new stuff.

180
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,091  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
This is the kind of thing...

181
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,324  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
...that makes her think
you love me more than her.

182
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,603  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
My God. Does she think that?

183
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,040  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, can you blame her?

184
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:58,482  X1:072 X2:643 Y1:450 Y2:524
We may have favored you unconsciously.
You were a marvel.

185
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:01,923  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:450 Y2:524
- The doctors said your mom couldn't...
- I don't want to hear it.

186
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,646  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Really?
- Well, not right now.

187
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:09,246  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:524
Monica came here for some memories.
Damn it, we'll give her some.

188
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,164  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, grab... .

189
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:14,364  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:524
Grab some boxes. We'll take stuff
from mine...

190
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:18,651  X1:133 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and whatever we can pass off
as hers, we'll put in there.

191
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,602  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:486 Y2:524
Like, this. She could have made this.

192
00:12:21,852 --> 00:12:23,922  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This could have been hers.
- Sure.

193
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:31,367  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you want to tell the medical marvel
story while we work, that'd be fine.

194
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:38,248  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
I am so psyched
I kept this chair for myself.

195
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,043  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. Me too.

196
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:51,244  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, this thing has
speakers in the headrest?

197
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:52,766  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:450 Y2:524
- No, really?
- Yeah.

198
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:55,321  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
You can hook it to the TV
and you get radio.

199
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,688  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
My chair heals itself.

200
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:07,765  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
All right. Let's just forget about
the people at the office, okay?

201
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:11,607  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's gotta be someone
worth sticking around for.

202
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:15,600  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
What about family or friends?
Maybe a girlfriend?

203
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,526  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, right.

204
00:13:17,812 --> 00:13:19,723  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?

205
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:22,087  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I should...

206
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:24,766  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:524
...be getting back to my thing now.

207
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,491  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:524
See you.

208
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,365  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not finished!
Don't you dare hang up on me!

209
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:32,168  X1:208 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
The new girl's good.

210
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:36,570  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:488 Y2:524
Which boxes are mine?

211
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,206  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
- These are yours right here.
- Okay.

212
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,285  X1:235 X2:479 Y1:484 Y2:524
A coloring book.

213
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,085  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
You loved that thing.

214
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:45,931  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:484 Y2:524
You never went anywhere without...

215
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:47,969  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:484 Y2:524
...without that coloring book.

216
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,287  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

217
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,046  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:446 Y2:524
Looks like I had trouble
staying in the lines.

218
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:53,685  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Nuh-uh!

219
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,287  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wow, look at this.

220
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:59,251  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:450 Y2:524
I can't believe I even
fit into this shirt.

221
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:04,926  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, this is yours.

222
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:07,845  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't know how that got in there.

223
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:11,563  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, this isn't my stuff.

224
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:14,969  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ross, these are your boxes.

225
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:20,044  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
Where are my boxes?

226
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:25,682  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
The garage flooded, sweetie,
and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.

227
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:27,361  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Just mine?

228
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:29,085  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm afraid so.

229
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:32,483  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

230
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,847  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
I used your boxes to divert
water away from the Porsche.

231
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,646  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:524
Ross' stuff is fine,
but I have no memories...

232
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,730  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
...so you could keep the bottom
of your car from water?

233
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,446  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
There was also
leaves and gook and stuff.

234
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,571  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe this!

235
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:58,242  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:524
Screw it. I'm having one.

236
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,729  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hey.

237
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:07,969  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
How'd you like to sit
in a chair that reclines...

238
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,163  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
...has a rolling massage...

239
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,607  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and speakers in the headrest?

240
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:14,768  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've tried that so many times...

241
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,765  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:524
...they won't even let me
in the store anymore.

242
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,364  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
What if I said you could
do it in my apartment?

243
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:23,766  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you telling me...

244
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:27,209  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
...you bought the chair
that makes all others obsolete?

245
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:32,003  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
The chair that <i>Sit Magazine</i> called
"Chair of the Year"?

246
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:34,761  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just purchased...

247
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:39,011  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.

248
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:41,362  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, that's awesome! That's great!
What made you do it?

249
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:44,405  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's a long story, but,
I broke Joey's chair...

250
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:47,206  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You broke Joey's chair?

251
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:50,643  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
I thought I did, that's why
I replaced it with mine.

252
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,601  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's how it got fixed!

253
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:58,044  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:524
You thought that elves
came in and fixed it?

254
00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,571  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

255
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:01,570  X1:294 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:524
Angels.

256
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,563  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm getting my chair back.

257
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:10,763  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Well, looks like
it wasn't healed after all!

258
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:14,448  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
I guess this chair's mine now.

259
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,204  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey, you broke my chair!

260
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,367  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:524
Your chair?

261
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:23,405  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
He thought he broke it,
so he switched chairs.

262
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:25,250  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:488 Y2:524
So there was no miracle?

263
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,170  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, Joe. No miracle.

264
00:16:27,452 --> 00:16:29,329  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, no! This is devastating!

265
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:35,324  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
My faith is shaken. I'm glad I have
a new chair to get me through this.

266
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:41,646  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
Where can I find Earl?
He's the supply manager here.

267
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:43,245  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't know any Earl.

268
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,647  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm right here!

269
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:50,245  X1:313 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:524
Earl?

270
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,326  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm Phoebe.

271
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:54,851  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
Phoebe?

272
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:57,327  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:524
The lady who sells toner?

273
00:16:57,532 --> 00:17:00,092  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, you can't kill yourself.

274
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:03,326  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, I really appreciate
you coming down...

275
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:05,124  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, I can't let you do it.

276
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:09,411  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Why?
- Because, fate made me call you today.

277
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,250  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought it was toner.

278
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:16,043  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Think about it, okay?
This isn't even my regular job.

279
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:19,281  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
My first day, you're my first call.

280
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:22,922  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
Somebody else may have hung up,
but I wouldn't do that...

281
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,924  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:488 Y2:524
...because I know about this stuff.

282
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,732  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
- My mom killed herself.
- Really?

283
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,088  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
How?

284
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,805  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm not gonna give you tips.

285
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:34,450  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't you see that this...

286
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:38,361  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
...all came together so I could
stop you from doing this?

287
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:42,761  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
- No, it's fate.

288
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:46,570  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
It doesn't really seem like
enough to be fate.

289
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:47,881  X1:285 X2:430 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, well.

290
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,889  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, here's a weird thing.

291
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:54,045  X1:088 X2:627 Y1:484 Y2:524
My mother was also a supply manager.

292
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,329  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm actually the office manager.

293
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,443  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God! So was she!

294
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:01,768  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
And get this, okay.

295
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:05,482  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
Your name is Earl, right?
Her name was Pearl.

296
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:07,848  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:524
Puh-Earl.

297
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,690  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Was there anything else?

298
00:18:10,892 --> 00:18:11,881  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sure.

299
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:15,522  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:524
Where're you from?

300
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:18,292  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Philadelphia.
- Oh, my God, so was she!

301
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,804  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've got goose bumps.

302
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:23,208  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

303
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:25,448  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.

304
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:29,162  X1:085 X2:630 Y1:484 Y2:524
These jerks might not care about you...

305
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:33,121  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but the universe does,
and that says a lot.

306
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:36,644  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did you hear that?

307
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:39,487  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:524
I don't need you guys
to care about me...

308
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:41,683  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:488 Y2:524
...because the universe cares!

309
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:44,162  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:524
The whole universe!

310
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:52,244  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:524
I really wish they'd care
a little bit.

311
00:18:53,652 --> 00:18:55,449  X1:222 X2:493 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, this is terrible.

312
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,603  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everything is destroyed.

313
00:18:58,972 --> 00:18:59,927  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:524
Look at this.

314
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:04,211  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
It meant enough for me to save,
and now I can't tell what it is.

315
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,403  X1:261 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's still soft.

316
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,609  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do you think this is?

317
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:15,009  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:524
I think it was a mouse.

318
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:25,971  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
- How are you, honey?
- How do you think I am?

319
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:28,527  X1:066 X2:649 Y1:482 Y2:524
You've wrecked my childhood memories...

320
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:30,370  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
...you love Ross more than me.

321
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:33,331  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I just rubbed
a dead mouse on my face.

322
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:39,564  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Sweetheart, we love you
just as much as Ross.

323
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,603  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry about what happened...

324
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:45,128  X1:199 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and I probably can't
make it up to you...

325
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:47,124  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:524
...but here's a start.

326
00:19:49,932 --> 00:19:52,924  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's this?
- It's the key to my Porsche.

327
00:19:53,132 --> 00:19:55,202  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, the key to your Porsche.

328
00:19:56,332 --> 00:19:57,367  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

329
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,130  X1:297 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?!

330
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:04,962  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
I've considered getting rid of it.
I saw my reflection the other day.

331
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:08,249  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:450 Y2:524
Your mother's right,
I do look like an ass.

332
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:11,932  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're giving it to me?
You're kidding.

333
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:14,965  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, wait a minute.

334
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,721  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
A couple of stupid boxes get wet,
and she gets a Porsche?

335
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:22,683  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Let's take a drive?
- All right!

336
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:26,362  X1:087 X2:627 Y1:488 Y2:524
What about me? I'm a medical marvel!

337
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:40,880  X1:274 X2:441 Y1:052 Y2:093
Hey, guys.

338
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,884  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:052 Y2:094
Have you seen Chandler's chair?

339
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:45,048  X1:141 X2:572 Y1:052 Y2:093
Joey broke it. He got rid of it.

340
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:49,291  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:052 Y2:131
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
and the Barcalounger's gone?

341
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:52,450  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:052 Y2:093
This is the best day ever!

00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:07,208  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Happy birthday!

2
00:00:07,413 --> 00:00:08,289  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
Happy birthday!

3
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:13,005  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:524
Rach, come on.

4
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,568  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's your birthday!

5
00:00:15,373 --> 00:00:16,362  X1:300 X2:416 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey... .

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,965  X1:164 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
She's not as pretty as
she was when she was 29.

7
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:26,490  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:446 Y2:524
Ms. Greene wants to establish some
ground rules before she comes out.

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,924  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:524
Please don't use the words
"old" or "downhill"...

9
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,522  X1:214 X2:504 Y1:444 Y2:524
...or "They still look
pretty damn good. "

10
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:37,642  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:524
They do.

11
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,571  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:486 Y2:524
Rachel, come on out.

12
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:42,611  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica made breakfast.

13
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,212  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
Chocolate chip pancakes.

14
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:46,492  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:524
We've got presents.

15
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:50,283  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:524
Good ones?

16
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,564  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're all from the list
you gave us two weeks ago.

17
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:58,045  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
Can I keep the presents
and still be 29?

18
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:02,329  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
Come on, Rach, turning 30
is not that big a deal.

19
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:05,366  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Really? Is that how you felt
when you turned 30?

20
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:07,524  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why, God, why?

21
00:01:08,173 --> 00:01:11,563  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
We had a deal.
Let the others grow old, not me!

22
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:17,567  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:524
You guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?

23
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:22,244  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, it's not just you.
My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.

24
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,412  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
And now Chandler!

25
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,164  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're all getting so old.

26
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:30,807  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why are You doing this to us?

27
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:36,889  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524

You're in a great place in your life.
You have an amazing job, good friends.

00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:18,564  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:524
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

31
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:20,571  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:524
Your character is in a coma.

32
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,571  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:131
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry at this one.

33
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:30,483  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:052 Y2:132
I know my life's going pretty well,
but I see so many people...

34
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,964  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:052 Y2:132
...who've accomplished their goals
before they're 30.

35
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:36,892  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare
yourself to me.

36
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,168  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Come on, Phoebe!
- You can do it!

00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,526  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:446 Y2:524

38
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:51,890  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:131
I did it!
One mile on a Hippity Hop.

39
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:55,530  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:052 Y2:127
That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.

40
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:58,492  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:052 Y2:131
Except I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.

41
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,848  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:052 Y2:093
Oh, well. But, yeah!

42
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:05,288  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:052 Y2:131
Girls, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean.

43
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,685  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:524

What do you want to do?

00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:19,645  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't want to do anything.

45
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:24,608  X1:085 X2:629 Y1:052 Y2:131
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, like Ross.

46
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,569  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:052 Y2:093
That was a practical purchase.

47
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,412  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:052 Y2:093
I needed that car for transportation.

48
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:32,928  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay? I have a child.

49
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,563  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:488 Y2:524
How hot do I look in this?

50
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,692  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ross, a sports car?

51
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:42,090  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?

52
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,889  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's not what this is about.

53
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,283  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
I am a sports car enthusiast.

54
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,082  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I've always been into cars.
- What's the horsepower?

55
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:53,768  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't know, but look how shiny!

56
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:59,682  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:524
- I can't believe you bought this.
- So can I have a ride, stud?

57
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,292  X1:297 X2:418 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hop in.

58
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:06,043  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
Get ready for the
smoothest ride of your life.

59
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:30,692  X1:289 X2:426 Y1:488 Y2:524
Damn it.

60
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,291  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, who's next?

61
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:41,371  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:446 Y2:524
I am gonna do something today. I
won't sit around like some old lady.

62
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,848  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
I want to get something pierced.

63
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:47,250  X1:073 X2:643 Y1:484 Y2:524
Like my nose or my tongue or something.

64
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,091  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? Because that hurts.

65
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,091  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:446 Y2:524
So what?
The way I see it...

66
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,692  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:524
Son of a bitch!

67
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:57,087  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, I know what
you're going through.

68
00:04:57,293 --> 00:05:00,410  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm totally freaked out
about turning 25.

69
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,530  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Get out of my apartment.

70
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:08,882  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:524
Rach, I think that you're doing great.

71
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:11,806  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Let's face it,
no one handles this well.

72
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:13,845  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:524
Least of all you.

73
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,813  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Put that back on.
Monica will be here any minute.

74
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,083  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:524
But it hurts my Joey's apple.

75
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:31,044  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
For the last time, it's not named
after each individual man.

76
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:38,446  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
You've done a wonderful job with
the party. Everything's so lovely.

77
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:40,132  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, not as lovely as you.

78
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,683  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe you have a
30-year-old daughter.

79
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:47,568  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:524
And I can't believe you have
a tux that's 30 years old.

80
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:52,730  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's older than that. Ross was
conceived right near this tuxedo.

81
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,644  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:446 Y2:524
Everybody hide!
She's coming.

82
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,285  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everybody down!

83
00:06:05,813 --> 00:06:09,203  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Everybody stay here.
I'll find out what's going on.

84
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,846  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, you got the door open!

85
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,643  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, are you drunk?

86
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,048  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

87
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,408  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

88
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:27,812  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

89
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:32,330  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
See, I was a little nervous
about turning...

90
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:33,892  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
...30.

91
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,725  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
So the busboys took me out
for some drinks.

92
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:43,327  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
Might want to puke on you later.

93
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:49,523  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
Here's the thing. We've thrown
a very formal surprise party for you.

94
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,531  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Your parents and friends are in there.
- No!

95
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,722  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yes! Yes!
- No.

96
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:57,005  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, no! My parents have never
seen me drunk.

97
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:58,687  X1:218 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:524
That they know of.

98
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:03,652  X1:096 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
We'll get you some coffee.
They'll never know that you're drunk.

99
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,242  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You promise?
- I'll take care of it.

100
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,409  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love you so much.

101
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,521  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.

102
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:15,688  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
What about your breath?

103
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,649  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's still yours.

104
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,086  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:446 Y2:524
Now remember,
it's a surprise party.

105
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:25,523  X1:121 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
So when you go in, act surprised.

106
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,008  X1:298 X2:420 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ready?

107
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:36,241  X1:285 X2:429 Y1:484 Y2:524
Surprise!

108
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,805  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, forward. Forward.

109
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,128  X1:308 X2:406 Y1:484 Y2:524
Stop!

110
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:48,126  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, back... Stop!

111
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,332  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, for... Stop!

112
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,046  X1:263 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:524
Stop! Stop!

113
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,323  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

114
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:59,212  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'll break into this minivan,
put it in neutral.

115
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,132  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:446 Y2:524
You push it forward
so Ross can get out of the spot.

116
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:05,091  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right. Here we go.

117
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,287  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:524
Haul ass!

118
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:25,882  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Happy 30th birthday! Here.

119
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,806  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's for the child in you.
And the woman.

120
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,682  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:484 Y2:524
Happy 30th!

121
00:08:31,893 --> 00:08:33,611  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why do you keep saying that?

122
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:36,163  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
Because it's our 30th birthday.

123
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:39,604  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31. Okay.

124
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:41,732  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait.

125
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,206  X1:262 X2:453 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, it's you.

126
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,051  X1:255 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah. What?

127
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:49,209  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.

128
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:53,202  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's what it says
on my birth certificate.

129
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,926  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:524
You have a birth certificate?

130
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:57,926  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
I got a big box of family stuff
when my mom died.

131
00:08:58,573 --> 00:08:59,403  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:524
Our mom.

132
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,122  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:484 Y2:524
Right. Okay.

133
00:09:02,813 --> 00:09:06,726  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Do you have mine?
- No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.

134
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:10,726  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

135
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:13,649  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God, we are 31!

136
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,326  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

137
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:19,012  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just lost a whole year of my life.

138
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:20,447  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

139
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,287  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Your middle name is Pamela?
- Yes.

140
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:27,405  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?

141
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:28,563  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

142
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:29,643  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Phoebe.

143
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:34,482  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's my first name.
- Right. Okay. Then, no.

144
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:40,846  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
We made it across the room.
You're doing great.

145
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:42,288  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's going on?

146
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:44,006  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica's a little drunk.

147
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,249  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah! I love drunk Monica.

148
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,805  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, she's so much more fun
than regular Monica.

149
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,929  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:482 Y2:524
She doesn't want her parents to know.

150
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:59,371  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
All right, all right.
Here's what we'll do.

151
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:03,361  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'll get twice as drunk,
then no one will even notice her.

152
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,972  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's going on?

153
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:11,002  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica's wasted.

154
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:13,681  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe that'll liven up this party.

155
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:16,648  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you just help her get changed?

156
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:20,170  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:446 Y2:524
Taking care of a drunk, naked woman
seems like a job for Joey.

157
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:26,804  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:488 Y2:524
This one's from me.

158
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:29,567  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:524
It wasn't on your list,
but it's really fun.

159
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:32,845  X1:275 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
A scooter.

160
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,603  X1:238 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
Stick to the list.

161
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:41,131  X1:188 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
Always stick to the list.

162
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,122  X1:154 X2:562 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, no, I love it. Thank you.

163
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:47,004  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
Open ours next! Open ours next!

164
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,602  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
Now that you're a couple,
we don't get two gifts?

165
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,805  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:524
For my last birthday,
you gave me a hug.

166
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,689  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:488 Y2:524
Read the card! Read the card!

167
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,563  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Happy birthday, Grandma.

168
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:06,367  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's better to be over the hill...

169
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:09,049  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:488 Y2:524
...than buried under it.

170
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:14,965  X1:110 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
All our love, Monica and Chandler. "
That's funny.

171
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:17,488  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, no. That was a joke.

172
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:20,366  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:482 Y2:524
I know, I get it. It's funny.

173
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:22,450  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
Because you're not a grandma.

174
00:11:22,653 --> 00:11:26,043  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:524
To be a grandma, you have to
be married and have children.

175
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:30,565  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.

176
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,486  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm just gonna go... .

177
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:39,572  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
All you had to do was buy the card.

178
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:49,721  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was stupid to get upset about
not having a husband and kids.

179
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,123  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
All I really needed was a plan.

180
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,245  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:486 Y2:524
See, I want three kids.

181
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:59,283  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
And you want to have them all at the
same time and all for your brother.

182
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,691  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
As I was saying... .

183
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:06,284  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
I should have the first one
by the time I'm 35.

184
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,529  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
Which gives me five years.

185
00:12:09,213 --> 00:12:13,206  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't
have to get pregnant until I'm 34.

186
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:17,002  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity clothes.

187
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,448  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
But I want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

188
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:25,644  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? That long?

189
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:33,126  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look all you want, it's happening.

190
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:39,852  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't have to get married until
I'm 33. That's three whole years.

191
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,287  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait a minute, though.

192
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:44,969  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'll need a year and a half
to plan the wedding.

193
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:48,046  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:524
And I'd like to know the guy
for a year, year and a half...

194
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:50,363  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
...before we get engaged.

195
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:55,326  X1:103 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.

196
00:12:56,613 --> 00:13:00,447  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which is fine
because you just turned...

197
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:02,331  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
...28!

198
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,483  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

199
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:09,083  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
I should already be with
the guy I'm gonna marry.

200
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:17,724  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you quit hogging it?

201
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:26,447  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm telling you, it's like
watching Bambi learn how to walk.

202
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,326  X1:254 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're drunk.

203
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:33,082  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

204
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:37,010  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Maybe I'm a little drunk.

205
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:40,841  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:488 Y2:524
Are those crab cakes?

206
00:13:41,093 --> 00:13:44,642  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
I told you to come straight to me
when they were ready.

207
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:48,132  X1:232 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
How you feeling?

208
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,613  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:524
You are so handsome.

209
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:56,690  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
I want to make love to you
right here, right now.

210
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,052  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
I really wish that you wouldn't.

211
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:08,209  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just get through a little bit more,
then we can put you in bed.

212
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:12,332  X1:101 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:524
Just smile, and don't talk to anyone.

213
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:16,642  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
Speech, speech!
Let's hear from the birthday girl.

214
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:18,642  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:524
Pheebs!

215
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:20,764  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
See, everybody's looking at me.

216
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,326  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:524
The plan's working.

217
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:26,326  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:524
I didn't even have to
take off my top yet.

218
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,690  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Speech. Come on, speech!

219
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:35,370  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
You can't keep your hands off her
for one second.

220
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:37,092  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:524
I think it's nice.

221
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,170  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think it's necessary.

222
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,692  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:484 Y2:524
I want to thank you all for coming.

223
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,771  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
My family and...

224
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,002  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:524
...my friends.

225
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,527  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd really like to say that I'm... .

226
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,086  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
You know what I'd really like to say?

227
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,451  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm drunk!

228
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,730  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's right, Mom and Dad.

229
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:14,164  X1:073 X2:641 Y1:488 Y2:524
Your little old "Harmomica" is hammered.

230
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:17,568  X1:231 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
And guess what?

231
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,724  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:488 Y2:524
I've been drunk before.

232
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,922  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:524
And I've smoked a cigarette.

233
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:28,493  X1:215 X2:501 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's all okay.
It's okay because...

234
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,530  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I turned 30 today.

235
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,047  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I can do anything I want.

236
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,252  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Because I am a grownup.

237
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:45,447  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, quick. Help me get this off.

238
00:15:49,413 --> 00:15:50,812  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
I lost a whole year.

239
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,527  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:450 Y2:524
I can't believe it.
This is so unfair!

240
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,610  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.

241
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:57,041  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:488 Y2:524
Will it? Will it?

242
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,893  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
How would you feel if
you found out you were 31?

243
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,768  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's not gonna happen.
Because we have a new deal.

244
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:08,049  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
Plus, it ruined my schedule.

245
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:12,132  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:524
I haven't done the things
I wanted to do before I was 31.

246
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,129  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Like what?

247
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,450  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:524
Like I haven't met
any Portuguese people.

248
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,161  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:524
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

249
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,529  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
And I haven't been to sniper school.

250
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:26,530  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't we go and
have some birthday cake?

251
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:30,806  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just feel like being by myself.
See you guys later. Thanks.

252
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,212  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:488 Y2:524
Poor Pheebs.

253
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:38,203  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, you guys, I think
I'm gonna walk her home.

254
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:43,927  X1:279 X2:436 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, man.
- What?

255
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,044  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
He's gonna eat the cake.

256
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:49,132  X1:293 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:524
Pheebs!

257
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:50,847  X1:272 X2:444 Y1:486 Y2:524
Listen, I... .

258
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,728  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:524
Close your eyes.

259
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,728  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's one thing to
cross off your list.

260
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,132  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah.

261
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:15,732  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
Plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.

262
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,809  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, is everybody clear?

263
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:23,924  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
We're gonna pick it up...

264
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:27,326  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and move it.

265
00:17:28,493 --> 00:17:32,771  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
All we need is teamwork.
We're gonna lift the car...

266
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,649  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and slide it out.

267
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,562  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:524
Lift...

268
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,610  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and slide.

269
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,732  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Ross, I really don't think this...
- Lift...

270
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:47,963  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and slide.

271
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,687  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Okay, here we go.
- All right, everyone.

272
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:52,491  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:524
Lift...

273
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,129  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and slide.

274
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:05,802  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, Joey...
- Come on, Rach, my turn just started.

275
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,129  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:484 Y2:524
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.

276
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,211  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?

277
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,404  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
Whatever. I'm not your mother.

278
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:17,011  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:524
Not in the street!

279
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,606  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Are you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm... .

280
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:27,201  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let's talk.

281
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:30,806  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's up?

282
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,566  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, Tag... .

283
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:37,049  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're such a great guy.
And we have so much fun together.

284
00:18:37,253 --> 00:18:38,447  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:524
- But l...
- Wait.

285
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,250  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think I see where you're going.

286
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:45,008  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Before you say anything else,
can I say one more thing?

287
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:54,492  X1:279 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well said.

288
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,890  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
And a good example of the fun
I was referring to.

289
00:19:01,213 --> 00:19:06,003  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
But I think I'm past the point
where I can just have fun.

290
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:09,603  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't do this. This is just
because you're turning 30.

291
00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:11,246  X1:272 X2:442 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, it is.

292
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:15,130  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:524
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.

293
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:18,008  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Twenty-four, actually.
- Oh, God.

294
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:25,123  X1:136 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what I wish?
I wish you were six years older.

295
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:29,565  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, if I'm wishing for stuff,
I wish I was six years younger.

296
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:33,212  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Me too.
- Yeah. Sorry.

297
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:43,167  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, how'd it go?

298
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:49,004  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:446 Y2:524
If I only want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?

299
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:52,125  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
You did the right thing.

300
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,609  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
I don't like this anymore.

301
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:06,329  X1:149 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.

302
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:11,611  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you realize in 10 years
we're gonna be 40?

303
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:16,332  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why, God?

304
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:19,087  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why are you doing this to us?

305
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:29,845  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:052 Y2:094
Yes! My baby's finally free.

306
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:31,327  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:052 Y2:093
All right!

307
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,890  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:052 Y2:094
Start it up. Let's go!

308
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:44,012  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:052 Y2:088
How hot are we?

309
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:53,370  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:052 Y2:093
You want to buy a car?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:02,292 --> 00:00:03,645  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thanks for coming by.

2
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:07,805  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
We wanted to bounce some ideas off
of you about the wedding ceremony.

3
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:11,530  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- It's just... .

4
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:14,206  X1:188 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:524
Monica said "wedding. "

5
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:17,572  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
We thought one of you
could read something.

6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:21,608  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.

7
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:24,405  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:524
Too?

8
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,323  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
I kind of have something else
planned for you guys.

9
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:31,202  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Do you mind telling us what it is?
- Sorry.

10
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:34,603  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm kind of keeping this one
on the QT.

11
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:37,326  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Whatever it is,
I hope it involves winking.

12
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:40,966  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hey.

13
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:43,203  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:524
I talked to one of the <i>DOOL</i> writers...

14
00:00:43,452 --> 00:00:45,408  X1:216 X2:498 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What is <i>DOOL</i>?
<i>-Days Of Our Lives. </i>

15
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:51,007  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
You won't believe it. My character
is coming out of his coma!

16
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,129  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's wonderful.
- Wow, Joey.

17
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:56,921  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:446 Y2:524
And not only that.
I'm getting a new brain!

18
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:01,851  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
So great things are happening at work
and in your personal life.

19
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:04,485  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're getting a new brain?

20
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,326  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
They're killing off
one of the characters...

21
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:10,365  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and her brain is being transplanted
into my body.

22
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:15,488  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
What? A brain transplant?

23
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:17,245  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's ridiculous.

24
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:20,529  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's ridiculous that you
haven't had sex in three months.

25
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:28,687  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's winter.
There are fewer people on the street.

26
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:31,246  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who are they killing off?

27
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,881  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
Cecilia Monroe.
She plays Jessica Lockhart.

28
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,531  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No!

29
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:39,648  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
She is so good at throwing drinks
in people's faces.

30
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,452  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a drink.

31
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:45,126  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:446 Y2:524
The way she slaps people.
Wouldn't you love to?

32
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,805  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:488 Y2:524
Don't do it.

33
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,409  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:488 Y2:524
And she's been on the show forever.

34
00:01:49,612 --> 00:01:52,126  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
It's gonna be really hard
to fill her shoes.

35
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,761  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:524
Help me out here.

36
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:58,324  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
When you come out
of the brain transplant...

37
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:00,927  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
...you are going to be her?

38
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:03,925  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

39
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:10,208  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.

40
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:13,728  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
The One With Joey's New Brain

41
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:14,961  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:446 Y2:524

42
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,764  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:052 Y2:093
Rach, so that guy there:

43
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:50,047  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:052 Y2:093
Straight or gay?

44
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:55,810  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:052 Y2:132
Oh, yeah, he's too cute
to be straight.

45
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,043  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:052 Y2:131
Knockers will help us
figure it out.

46
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,170  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:052 Y2:093
All right, straight.

47
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,650  X1:242 X2:472 Y1:488 Y2:524
And not subtle.

48
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:12,524  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
He left his cell phone.

49
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:15,332  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:052 Y2:131
We could have Gunther
put it in lost and found.

50
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:19,042  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:052 Y2:131
Or we could use it to call China,
see how those guys are doing.

51
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,769  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:052 Y2:126
What if he calls his own cell phone
and I answer...

52
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:26,243  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:052 Y2:126
...and we start talking
and we fell in love?

53
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:28,522  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:052 Y2:093
Would that be a great story?

54
00:03:28,772 --> 00:03:31,445  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:052 Y2:131
Kind of like a fairy tale
for the digital age.

55
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,248  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
That does sound great.
I'm getting the phone.

56
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:37,643  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:131
What? Wait.
Why do you get the story?

57
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,446  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:052 Y2:132
I haven't been
out on a date in so long.

58
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:43,047  X1:083 X2:632 Y1:052 Y2:093
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

59
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:47,683  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:052 Y2:132
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having sex.

60
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,968  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. Great. I get the phone.

61
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:53,204  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
No way. You just broke up with Tag
a week ago.

62
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:58,480  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
Yeah, and until now, I didn't think
I would love again.

63
00:03:59,452 --> 00:04:00,680  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Nice try.
- Wait.

64
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,890  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
How do we fairly decide
who gets the phone?

65
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:05,850  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't know.

66
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,841  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Maybe we could... .

67
00:04:15,852 --> 00:04:17,126  X1:225 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ah-ha! Too slow!

68
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,926  X1:217 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ah-ha! Too cocky.

69
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,401  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm dating him.
There's nothing you can do.

70
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:29,601  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yes, there is.

71
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,969  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
Are you going to kill him
like you did Charles?

72
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,605  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my baby.

73
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:43,205  X1:317 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
<i>Cut! </i>

74
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:51,609  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
That was great. And that slap looked
so real. How do you do that?

75
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:55,327  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, just years of experience.
- Can I get some ice here?!

76
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:59,645  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just wanted to say how wonderful
I think you are.

77
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:02,401  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're not the fan who's dying,
are you?

78
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:06,444  X1:111 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.

79
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:09,883  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm the guy in the coma.
- Oh, that was a real person?

80
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:16,046  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:524
Since I'm getting your brain
when you leave the show...

81
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,049  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I was wondering if...

82
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,648  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm leaving the show?
- Why? Did you hear something?

83
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:25,328  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who told you that?

84
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,964  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:524
- One of the writers.
- Was it bald or was it tall?

85
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:32,924  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
You know, it doesn't matter,
because it is not true.

86
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:34,207  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

87
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:37,967  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:446 Y2:524
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

88
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,766  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
...about a character I've played
for 20 years!

89
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,451  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:446 Y2:524
Miss Monroe...
Oh, there you go.

90
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:53,966  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, look, I have an idea.

91
00:05:54,172 --> 00:05:58,324  X1:077 X2:639 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed dial...

92
00:05:58,572 --> 00:06:02,884  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and then whoever has more in common
with him gets the phone.

93
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:06,205  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Fine. All right.
- All right.

94
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,569  X1:089 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:524
First name on the speed dial is "Mom. "

95
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,485  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh. I lost my mom to suicide.

96
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,408  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't use that to get the cute guy
and the last blueberry muffin.

97
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:19,086  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
Did I use that already today? Sorry.

98
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:23,768  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:486 Y2:524
"Ben, Carlos, David..."

99
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:27,288  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, I win. He's got Barney's
on his speed dial.

100
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:29,841  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
You don't know it's Barney's
the store.

101
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,560  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:448 Y2:524
That could be his friend's
house, a bar...

102
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,882  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
Who has Barney's the store
on their speed dial?

103
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,123  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:484 Y2:524
His new girlfriend.

104
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:51,727  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
What is that?

105
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,566  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.

106
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:59,206  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
Sounds like it's coming
from across the street.

107
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,769  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my God.
- What?

108
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:05,242  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
The thing that Ross was gonna
do at our wedding?

109
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:09,007  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
He was hanging out with me and said,
"You're half Scottish, right?"

110
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:12,809  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.

111
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:24,008  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:446 Y2:524
Unbelievable.
Why is your family Scottish?

112
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:27,971  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why is your family Ross?

113
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,966  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
He cannot play at our wedding.

114
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,246  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
I mean, come on. That is just noise!

115
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,289  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's not even a song.

116
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,726  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait. If you listen very carefully...

117
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:43,844  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I think it's "Celebration"
by Kool and the Gang.

118
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:52,570  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're right.
They are writing me out of the show.

119
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:56,043  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
They don't know exactly when
it's going to happen, but soon...

120
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,805  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and then that's it.

121
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,930  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
If it was up to me,
you would never leave the show.

122
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:03,163  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah, thanks.
- I mean it.

123
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:06,529  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
I can't believe they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.

124
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:10,930  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're gonna be devastated.
Heartbroken. They love you so much.

125
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,329  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, you're right.

126
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:15,166  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you.

127
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,130  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's your name again?

128
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:19,850  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joey.
- Thank you.

129
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:22,162  X1:230 X2:484 Y1:488 Y2:524
That is so sweet.

130
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:25,280  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
The only reason
I came up to you before...

131
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:27,090  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:486 Y2:524
...is because, well...

132
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:30,244  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I'm really nervous about being you.

133
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:34,331  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
If you could help me capture
the essence of the character... .

134
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:37,166  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:524
Help me keep Jessica alive.
Please?

135
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:40,931  X1:205 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey, I will help you.

136
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:44,482  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...

137
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,769  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:524
...but because I owe it to Jessica.

138
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:50,685  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

139
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:53,492  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:524
I've been watching some tapes.
How's this?

140
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:57,682  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
Jessica Lockhart will never
step foot in this place again!

141
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:59,081  X1:302 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:524
Never!

142
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:04,930  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
Jessica doesn't have
an English accent.

143
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:07,168  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:484 Y2:524
I can do an English accent?

144
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,772  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:524
That baby's going on my resume.

145
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:17,607  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hi. How are you?
- Good.

146
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:20,167  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
Remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...

147
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:23,324  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
...we decided I was gonna keep
the cute guy's phone?

148
00:09:24,452 --> 00:09:27,922  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was gonna keep it in my purse, so if
it rang, I could just pick it up?

149
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:33,170  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you remember going into my purse
and stealing the phone?

150
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:35,846  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ooh, now you lost me.

151
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:38,323  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You stole the phone.
- No, I didn't.

152
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:41,450  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're saying if I called it,
it wouldn't ring?

153
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:42,727  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No.
- Okay.

154
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:47,329  X1:077 X2:637 Y1:446 Y2:524
But while you dial, let me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.

155
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:50,923  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, it does work.

156
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,123  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Phoebe.
- That is a different phone.

157
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:58,923  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi.
Is Rachel there?

158
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:02,408  X1:088 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yes, she is. Just one moment, please.
It's for me!

159
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:06,050  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:484 Y2:524
That is damning evidence.

160
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,924  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

161
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:13,402  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:524
My digital fairy tale's
about to begin.

162
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:18,167  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Would you stop doing that?

163
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:21,165  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
Hello? Yes, I'm the one
who found your phone.

164
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,846  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Phoebe, you can't...
- Shh, I'm on a call.

165
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:29,766  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
Say, 8:30?

166
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,731  X1:229 X2:485 Y1:484 Y2:524
At my apartment.

167
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,322  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's 5 Morton Street,
apartment 14.

168
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:40,531  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
And then maybe, you know, after,
we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.

169
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,967  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

170
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:47,727  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:524
I will be here when he comes over.

171
00:10:47,972 --> 00:10:50,042  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:524
How will you know what time
to come over?

172
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,487  X1:240 X2:474 Y1:484 Y2:524
You just said it.

173
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:56,601  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

174
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:05,249  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:524
The essence of the character
is rooted in her confidence.

175
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:08,211  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
So when Jessica enters a room,
for instance...

176
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:10,283  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:484 Y2:524
...she owns everything...

177
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:14,047  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and every person in that room.

178
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:17,250  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You try it.
- Okay.

179
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,163  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's not mad at the room.

180
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:31,324  X1:179 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Try it again. He owns it.
He owns the room.

181
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:36,043  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:524
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!

182
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:38,808  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's a little weird,
but it's getting better.

183
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:44,845  X1:100 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

184
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:47,242  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's been 20 years of my life.

185
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:51,048  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.

186
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:55,080  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'll give you a chance to shake
things up. Play different characters.

187
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,651  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:488 Y2:524
You're so talented.

188
00:11:56,892 --> 00:12:01,408  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
Probably should've just left years ago
when the offers were pouring in...

189
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:04,485  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but I just got
so comfy here and... .

190
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:07,047  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
I turned down some amazing work.

191
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:08,566  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Like what?

192
00:12:09,612 --> 00:12:12,206  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, let's just say
if I'd left 15 years ago...

193
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:16,809  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
...the landscape of Mexican
cinema would be very different today.

194
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,370  X1:305 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wow.

195
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:26,567  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
But, well, now... .
Now's a different time for me.

196
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:32,166  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.

197
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:34,562  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:524
Let me tell you something, okay?

198
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:39,283  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:524
When I watch you do a scene, I'm
thinking, "She is a great actress. "

199
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:43,969  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:524
But I'm also thinking, "She is hot. "

200
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:48,083  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:524
You think I'm hot?

201
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:51,090  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
You own the room.

202
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,369  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
We should probably get the... .

203
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,682  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...

204
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:07,691  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:524
So when Jessica kisses a man...

205
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,212  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
...she usually puts...

206
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:14,205  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:488 Y2:524
...both her hands on the man's face.

207
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,807  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:446 Y2:524
I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?

208
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:20,283  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:524
No, it's because that way
the camera only sees her.

209
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,889  X1:220 X2:496 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to try it?

210
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,083  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, okay.

211
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:42,286  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
That was good. That was really good.

212
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:49,091  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
But I think that maybe your hands
are just a little off. They should...

213
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:59,082  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, I feel like a snack.

214
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:02,802  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, like you are.

215
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:07,251  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything
from my Scottish heritage.

216
00:14:07,492 --> 00:14:08,925  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

217
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:13,406  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, it's just that my entire family
was run out of Scotland by...

218
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:16,051  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:484 Y2:524
...Vikings.

219
00:14:16,892 --> 00:14:21,488  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:524
It sounds like your family's ready
to rediscover its Scottish roots.

220
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,131  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't play bagpipes
at the wedding!

221
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,686  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
How did you know?

222
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:31,608  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:446 Y2:524
- We heard you play from our apartment.
- Were you the ones who called the cops?

223
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:35,087  X1:098 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's not really important right now.

224
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,682  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
What is important is, while we
appreciate the gesture...

225
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:42,885  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
...we just don't feel that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.

226
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,124  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Why not?
- Because we hate them.

227
00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:50,287  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just give me a chance to perform for
you, then decide whatever you want.

228
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:53,842  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not gonna tell you what song
I'm gonna play, either.

229
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:55,844  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let's just say when it's over...

230
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:59,801  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
...I'll bet there'll be
a wee bit o' celebration.

231
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:08,370  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, hey!

232
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:11,564  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
Who is it?

233
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,362  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's Tom.
I'm here to pick up the phone.

234
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,487  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why do you get to answer the door?

235
00:15:18,732 --> 00:15:21,200  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because it's my apartment.

236
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,408  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:484 Y2:524
Then I get to give him the phone.

237
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:26,962  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay. Good luck explaining
all the calls to China.

238
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:30,966  X1:326 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:524
Hi.

239
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,207  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wow, how long were we arguing for?

240
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:43,608  X1:084 X2:631 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're not the man who left the phone.

241
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:47,003  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:524
- No, that's my assistant.
- Is he coming?

242
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:49,120  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

243
00:15:49,372 --> 00:15:52,045  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Could you give us one second?
- Sure.

244
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,408  X1:189 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:524
We'll be right back, sir.

245
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:59,009  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

246
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,611  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you believe this?

247
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:03,889  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
We were waiting for a hot guy
and a hotter one shows up.

248
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,406  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know...

249
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,650  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

250
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:11,841  X1:242 X2:474 Y1:486 Y2:524
Rachel, listen...

251
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:15,971  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
...if you let me have him,
then I will really owe you one.

252
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:19,523  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right.

253
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,527  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, I will let you have him.

254
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,763  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
But you owe me. You owe me big.

255
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,286  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
Which one of you will I
take to dinner?

256
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,602  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, that'd be me, sir.

257
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,361  X1:309 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:524
<i>Nice. </i>

258
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:46,043  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, you certainly own that room.

259
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:51,926  X1:088 X2:628 Y1:446 Y2:524
Actually, I rent the whole place.
I just got what you meant. Thank you.

260
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:56,361  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- Hey.

261
00:16:58,012 --> 00:16:59,331  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

262
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:01,325  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

263
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:05,687  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!

264
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:09,049  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.

265
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,520  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's nice to know...

266
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:12,091  X1:293 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica!

267
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:16,042  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's my roommate, Rachel.

268
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,169  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:524
That explains the women's underwear.

269
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,925  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
Sure.

270
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:23,650  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, my God, it's true!

271
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,004  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can I just ask you to do me
just one favor?

272
00:17:29,252 --> 00:17:30,605  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:484 Y2:524
Certainly.

273
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:33,526  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
Would you slap me
right here in the face?

274
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:38,966  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'd love to, but my lawyer said
I can't do that anymore.

275
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:42,450  X1:204 X2:511 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, here we go.

276
00:17:42,652 --> 00:17:44,688  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, wait. Just one moment.

277
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:49,682  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
- You're a stupid bitch.
- I really can't slap you.

278
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:53,682  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:524
- My God, you're great.
- Thanks for stopping by.

279
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,682  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
- I am so sorry about that.
- Oh, no.

280
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:00,651  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:524
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.

281
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,245  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my God.
- What?

282
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,285  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:524
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.

283
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:08,602  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:450 Y2:524
- They don't?
- I'm in a coma.

284
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,207  X1:156 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
This must mean I have lines.

285
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:14,006  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

286
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:17,003  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
How does it happen?

287
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:24,401  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:524
You get thrown from a horse
into an electric fence.

288
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:28,328  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:524
A what? Jessica hates horses.

289
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:32,406  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
After this she's not gonna be crazy
about electricity, either.

290
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:40,522  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:448 Y2:524
Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse
was brilliant, Fredrick.

291
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:43,240  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
And the electric fence, inspired.

292
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:44,811  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thank you, sweetheart.

293
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,121  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:524
I can't believe she's really gone.

294
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:51,126  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look around you. All of this is ours.

295
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:53,010  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't think so.

296
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,207  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who are you?

297
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,204  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:486 Y2:524
What's the matter, Dina?

298
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:04,006  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't you recognize your own...

299
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,611  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:488 Y2:524
...mother?

300
00:19:08,412 --> 00:19:11,006  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>Cut! That was great, everybody. </i>
<i>Thank you. </i>

301
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,607  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:488 Y2:524
That was so wonderful!

302
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:17,009  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
I think that you're a better
Jessica than I ever was.

303
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:19,925  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, no.
- Of course not, but you were good.

304
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,241  X1:292 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:524
Thanks.

305
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,562  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:484 Y2:524
Good news. I got another job.

306
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:26,087  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Great. Hey, all right! What is it?

307
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,402  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
A film in Guadalajara.

308
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:31,005  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:484 Y2:524
The airport?

309
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:34,445  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, that's LaGuardia.

310
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,249  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:448 Y2:524
- This is Mexico.
- Oh, wow.

311
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,642  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, how long will you be gone?

312
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,610  X1:254 X2:461 Y1:484 Y2:524
Eight months.

313
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:50,007  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's a really long time.
- Yeah, but you could come and visit.

314
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:54,285  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
I bet you could own
a few places down there.

315
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:59,011  X1:131 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, you know, I should probably
buy a place in the city first.

316
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:03,406  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
And I just got what you meant.
That is...

317
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,802  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's a tricky one.
- It's tricky.

318
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:10,761  X1:273 X2:442 Y1:488 Y2:524
Good luck.

319
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,125  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
You too.

320
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:31,124  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
Now, remember, I'm still learning.

321
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,846  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:486 Y2:524
One, two, three, four!

322
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:02,287  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:093
You know this song. Sing along.

323
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:20,041  X1:319 X2:397 Y1:052 Y2:088
So?

324
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:21,881  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:052 Y2:088
No!

- Hi.
- Hi! Hi, Ben.

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:07,403  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- We have a bathroom emergency.

3
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:08,846  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:524
Go ahead.

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:14,251  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:524
Before we do, are any of Joey's
special "romance" magazines in there?

5
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:19,087  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No.
- Okay, all clear.

6
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:21,085  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:486 Y2:524
Thanks, Phoebe.

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,687  X1:249 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's Rachel.

8
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:26,851  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
But whatever.

9
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:30,450  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could you do me a big favor?

10
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:33,001  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:450 Y2:524
I have a meeting
at the dean's office.

11
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:35,243  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

12
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,920  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What about Monica?
- She isn't home.

13
00:00:39,612 --> 00:00:42,968  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
So it would just be me alone?

14
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,651  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ben would be there.

15
00:00:49,052 --> 00:00:50,371  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's the matter?

16
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:54,484  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:448 Y2:524
I've never done that before.
Me and him, alone.

17
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,291  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:488 Y2:524
He's not an ex-con.

18
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:58,610  X1:251 X2:464 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, okay... .

19
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:01,571  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:524
- What do I do with him?
- I don't know, talk to him.

20
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:03,603  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Entertain him. Keep him alive.

21
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:07,842  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Okay.
- Ben, come here.

22
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:11,971  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm gonna leave you here with
Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

23
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:13,088  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
Gonna be okay?

24
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:15,288  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I think so.
- I wasn't talking to you.

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,568  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:488 Y2:524

00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:55,330  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:052 Y2:126
What about the second minister?
I kind of liked him.

28
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:59,406  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:052 Y2:126
- You mean the spitter?
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.

29
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,212  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:052 Y2:131
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veil.

30
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:06,644  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
- And the third guy?
- He kept staring at your chest.

31
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:08,525  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:052 Y2:093
Can you blame him?

32
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:12,326  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:052 Y2:132
I don't like the idea of
me saying, "I do"...

33
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,563  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:052 Y2:127
...while he's thinking,
"I'd do it too. "

34
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:19,530  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Well, then we still have a problem.
- With what?

35
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:24,123  X1:065 X2:650 Y1:052 Y2:131
We need someone to perform our wedding
but they're all boring or annoying...

36
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:26,249  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:052 Y2:093
...or keep staring at the ladies.

37
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:31,443  X1:129 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:524
You should have one of us do it.

38
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,644  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:052 Y2:132
We're getting "married" married,
not "6th-grade" married.

39
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:37,130  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:052 Y2:094
No, it's a real thing.

40
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:41,126  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:052 Y2:131
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.

41
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,845  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:524
I call it!

42
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:45,683  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:052 Y2:093
What? It was my idea!

43
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:49,083  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
Thank you very much, but neither
of you is marrying us.

44
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:52,085  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
Does calling it not mean
anything anymore?

45
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:54,881  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:052 Y2:132
We're having a legitimate
clergy member.

46
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,606  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:052 Y2:131
And when I say legitimate,
I mean gay...

47
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:00,161  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and in control of his saliva.

48
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,567  X1:073 X2:642 Y1:484 Y2:524
Ben, you know, when you were a baby...

49
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:15,964  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
...we'd hang out all the time.

50
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:17,930  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:524
I was your daddy's girlfriend.

51
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:20,242  X1:186 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:524
But you're not anymore.

52
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,885  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:524
- No, I'm not.
- Because you guys were on a break...

53
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:27,168  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, we were not on a...

54
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:34,360  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:524
- When's my daddy coming back?
- Fifty-two minutes.

55
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:40,802  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:486 Y2:524
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

56
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,970  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

57
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:48,041  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Really? Like how?
- Well, you know, we would, um...

58
00:03:48,252 --> 00:03:50,686  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
...we'd repeat everything
the other said...

59
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:54,368  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
...or we'd jump out of closets
to scare each other...

60
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:58,082  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:446 Y2:524
...or switch the sugar with salt
so they put salt on their cereal.

61
00:03:58,532 --> 00:03:59,601  X1:219 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's a good one.

62
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:04,006  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Yeah, you like that one?
- Yeah, you're funny.

63
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:05,560  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm funny?

64
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,047  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, thank God.

65
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:09,764  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

66
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,963  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:484 Y2:524
You take a quarter...

67
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:17,002  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and you blacken the edge, right?

68
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:20,449  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
And then you say,
"I bet you can't roll this quarter...

69
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:22,922  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:446 Y2:524
...to your chin without it
leaving your face. "

70
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:28,160  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:524
And when they do it, they're left with
a line down the center of their face.

71
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:30,244  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can I do it to you?

72
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:34,006  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

73
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:42,681  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
So did you find anyone
to marry you yet?

74
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:46,004  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:524
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister
called...

75
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:49,646  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:524
...wondering if we're still together.

76
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:53,161  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
- We'll never find anybody.
- Then let me do it.

77
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:54,811  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joey...
- I've been thinking.

78
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:58,482  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of people.

79
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,042  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

80
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:05,486  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

81
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,883  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's true.
- The most important thing...

82
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,368  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
...is, it won't be some stranger
who barely knows you.

83
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,082  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:524
It'll be me. And I swear,
I'll do a really good job.

84
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:19,568  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Plus, I love you guys and it
would really mean a lot to me.

85
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,726  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:524
Might be kind of cool.

86
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,042  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:446 Y2:524
- So I can do it?
- Yeah, you can do it.

87
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,522  X1:239 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right! Okay!

88
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,567  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

89
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:32,040  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:524
Wait a minute.

90
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:35,126  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:446 Y2:524
Internet ministers
can have sex, right?

91
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:40,607  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:484 Y2:524
Coming.

92
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:51,087  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
I have a bone to pick with you.

93
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:54,804  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Uh-oh.
- Yes.

94
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,287  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ben learned a little trick.

95
00:05:59,812 --> 00:06:03,088  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, did he pull the old...?
- That's right, that's right.

96
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:07,091  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:484 Y2:524
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

97
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:10,090  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:484 Y2:524
...so the pee goes everywhere.

98
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:14,008  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

99
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:16,522  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know I hate practical jokes.

100
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:20,481  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're mean, they're stupid and
I don't want my son learning them.

101
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:24,884  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?

102
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:26,690  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I was barefoot.
- Oh.

103
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:32,091  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Tell me, the toilet thing is the
only thing you taught him, right?

104
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,041  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

105
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,326  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

106
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,604  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You got ordained?
- Yeah.

107
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:49,288  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

108
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,683  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
Our minister.

109
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:56,608  X1:112 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:524
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

110
00:06:56,812 --> 00:06:59,849  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:448 Y2:524
Listen, this is just
the first draft, so... .

111
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:03,849  X1:157 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
"We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

112
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,801  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
...to celebrate the special love
that Monica and Chandler share.

113
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:13,644  X1:198 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:524
It is a love based on
giving and receiving...

114
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,360  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
...as well as having and sharing.

115
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:21,362  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:524
And the love that they give
and have is shared and received.

116
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:26,005  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
And through this having and giving...

117
00:07:26,252 --> 00:07:28,971  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and sharing and receiving...

118
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:34,811  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:524
...we too can share and love
and have...

119
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,243  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and receive. "

120
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:42,043  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:484 Y2:524
Should we call the spitter?

121
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:52,364  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

122
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,921  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

123
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:58,001  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was just in the neighborhood...

124
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:01,642  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and I passed by your building and
thought, "What's up with Carol...

125
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,610  X1:187 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and sweet little Ben?"

126
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:07,124  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's nice. Well, come on in.
- Okay.

127
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,488  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'll make some coffee
and we can chat.

128
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:11,484  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'd love that.
I would love that.

129
00:08:13,772 --> 00:08:16,002  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:524
So where is sweet little Ben?

130
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:18,288  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:488 Y2:524
I would love to have a little...

131
00:08:21,652 --> 00:08:23,210  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:524
I found him!

132
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,009  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
Very funny. Come here.

133
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:29,888  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:524
That is exactly why I've
come here to talk to you, okay?

134
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:32,487  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Rachel, you want sugar?
- Yes, but...

135
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:34,609  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:484 Y2:524
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

136
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,645  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
No, just some milk would
be good, Carol. Thanks.

137
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:43,645  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:446 Y2:524
Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

138
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,770  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?"

139
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,164  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Don't do that.
- "Don't do that. "

140
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:53,121  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Your dad doesn't like pranks.
- "Your dad doesn't like pranks. "

141
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:55,563  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Oh, damn it.
- "Oh, damn it! "

142
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:57,291  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:524
No! Don't say that.

143
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:59,524  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Damn it!
- Go back to repeating.

144
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,205  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Damn it!
- Oh, crap.

145
00:09:01,452 --> 00:09:02,521  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Oh, crap! "

146
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:11,324  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

147
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:14,529  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, okay.

148
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:19,360  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
"When I think of the love that these
two givers and receivers share...

149
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:24,325  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I can't help but envy the lifetime
ahead of having and loving...

150
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:28,611  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:524
...and giving..." And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

151
00:09:28,852 --> 00:09:31,525  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
- How about "receiving"?
- Yes!

152
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:36,888  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:524
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

153
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:41,610  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:446 Y2:524
...but one cool thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

154
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:43,444  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:524
...is that it can be about us.

155
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:47,002  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
It can be more personal.
You can tell stories about us.

156
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:52,643  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay! Maybe I'll talk about London,
when you hooked up.

157
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,360  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Only I won't say "hooked up"...

158
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:58,530  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I'll say, "began their
beautiful journey...

159
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:01,161  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:446 Y2:524
- There you go.
...by doing it. "

160
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:05,961  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Joe.
- Okay, all right.

161
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,769  X1:094 X2:622 Y1:446 Y2:524
So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

162
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:13,448  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
...then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

163
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:17,964  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Isn't that what happened to you?
- Yeah!

164
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:22,567  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:524
I call that "London style. "

165
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,444  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
That didn't happen with us.

166
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,321  X1:102 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe you should say it is,
because "London style" sounds nice.

167
00:10:30,772 --> 00:10:32,364  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, uh... .

168
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,089  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

169
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,760  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:524
And Chandler was really sweet
and he consoled me and...

170
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:44,572  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:446 Y2:524
...we drank too much.
- Yeah, baby.

171
00:10:46,732 --> 00:10:51,283  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was a gentleman and I walked her to
her hotel room and said good night.

172
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:52,768  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
Oh.

173
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:56,363  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
- But then, later that night...
- Yeah, baby.

174
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,802  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:448 Y2:524
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
here in London, huh?

175
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,000  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I wasn't exactly
expecting company after...

176
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:17,404  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:488 Y2:524
...9:15.

177
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:19,526  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:484 Y2:524
Is Joey here?

178
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:24,004  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:524
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

179
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:28,366  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:524
You're not still upset about
what that guy told you, are you?

180
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:30,646  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:524
Wouldn't you be?

181
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:34,806  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's been a really emotional time
and you've had a lot to drink... .

182
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:36,650  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:484 Y2:524
You have to let that go, okay?

183
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,804  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
You were the most beautiful
woman in the room tonight.

184
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:41,768  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

185
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:45,402  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:524
You kidding? You're the most
beautiful woman in most rooms...

186
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,245  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:524
Whoa, what's going on?

187
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:55,402  X1:223 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
We just made out.

188
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:57,762  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We're making out?
- Not anymore.

189
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:02,207  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
- But we don't do that.
- I know, I thought it would be fun.

190
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:04,402  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:484 Y2:524
How drunk are you?

191
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:09,442  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:446 Y2:524
Enough to know I want to do this. Not
so much that you should feel guilty.

192
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:12,320  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's the perfect amount.

193
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:20,970  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You know what's weird?
- What?

194
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:23,442  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

195
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:27,810  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

196
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:32,481  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
Want to get under the covers?
Okay.

197
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,291  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wow, you are really fast!

198
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:46,524  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:446 Y2:524
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

199
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:50,401  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:524
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

200
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,646  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:450 Y2:524
- At the same time?
- Count of three?

201
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:56,611  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:486 Y2:524
One, two, three.

202
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:04,881  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectively ruined.

203
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:07,009  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:524
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.

204
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,086  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey, Joey, Joey...!

205
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:15,928  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

206
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,447  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hey, Joe.
I was just watching a movie... .

207
00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:24,608  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

208
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,005  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No!

209
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:29,801  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's cool, I'm still
with my bridesmaid.

210
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:31,525  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:524
Where are the condoms?

211
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,531  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:484 Y2:524
In my bag over there.

212
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,691  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could you leave me one?

213
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:45,848  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:484 Y2:524
For just you?

214
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,321  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yeah.

215
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:53,690  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right. There you go, buddy.

216
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,646  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
Go nuts.

217
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:00,171  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's what that was?

218
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:05,089  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:524
If I hadn't left you one, you two
might've never gotten together.

219
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,845  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Imagine if I had sent that hooker
like I was gonna?

220
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:13,081  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:524
It's like it was in the stars.

221
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:14,965  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, totally meant to be.

222
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:18,568  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
Tell him who you originally
wanted to hook up with that night.

223
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:21,163  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What?
- What?

224
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:22,841  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

225
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,492  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:446 Y2:524
Who did you originally
want to hook up with?

226
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:31,081  X1:096 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

227
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:35,365  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.

228
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:39,890  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wanted something stupid and
meaningless. I just wanted sex.

229
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:43,091  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
So, when I went to your
room that night...

230
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,489  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
...I was actually looking for Joey.

231
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:54,411  X1:265 X2:449 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yeah, baby.

232
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,930  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, baby.

233
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,520  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God.

234
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:02,490  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
You came looking for Joey?

235
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:06,850  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Were you planning on telling me this?
- No, I didn't think it was important.

236
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:09,688  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not important?
It's not important?

237
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:12,765  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him.

238
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:17,523  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you know how unbelievably
glad I am that Joey wasn't there?

239
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:18,568  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey!

240
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:23,330  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm a man of the cloth
but I still have feelings.

241
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,329  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's no way you're
doing this wedding now, okay?

242
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:32,002  X1:194 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
What? That's not fair.
It's not my fault.

243
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:33,731  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was with my bridesmaid.

244
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,923  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:524
And who's to say
I would've said yes?

245
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:38,202  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
I mean, I would've said yes.

246
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:42,330  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
You are making way too
big a deal out of this.

247
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:44,090  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everything worked out okay.

248
00:15:44,332 --> 00:15:45,651  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's just weird, okay?

249
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:49,931  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mental image of you and Monica.

250
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:52,891  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:524
I need... I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.

251
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:56,522  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
- It is to me.

252
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,883  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:524
You wanted to sleep with Batman
and settled for Robin.

253
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:07,329  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:446 Y2:524
- This is crazy.
- No, Robin is so gay.

254
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:14,090  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:446 Y2:524
- So now what have we agreed?
- No more pranks.

255
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:17,729  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What else?
- You and Daddy were not on a break.

256
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:19,041  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Very good.

257
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:25,211  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:484 Y2:524
Rachel, what are you doing here?

258
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:28,445  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm just visiting
my good friend Carol.

259
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:31,202  X1:223 X2:494 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Your good friend?
- Yeah.

260
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:33,091  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's her last name?

261
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:36,800  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:524
Carol...

262
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:39,005  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:450 Y2:524
...Lesbian.
- Nice.

263
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,811  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:484 Y2:524
By the way, that line down my face... .

264
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:50,166  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
The line that prompted a student
in my last class of the day to say:

265
00:16:51,332 --> 00:16:53,641  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

266
00:16:55,292 --> 00:16:57,123  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

267
00:16:57,452 --> 00:17:00,489  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

268
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,604  X1:266 X2:449 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay?
- Fine. Fine.

269
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:06,407  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
Once I taught him that stuff,
he called me "fun Aunt Rachel. "

270
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,568  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

271
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:12,722  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm glad you guys were bonding but...

272
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,968  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look, he doesn't have any siblings.

273
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,407  X1:093 X2:621 Y1:484 Y2:524
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

274
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:21,247  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:524
I haven't taught him anything
a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.

275
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,448  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Crap!
- I gotta go.

276
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:31,209  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:35,730  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:446 Y2:524
You want this scone? It came for me
but it would rather sleep with you.

278
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:38,725  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nothing even happened.

279
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,442  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:524
I just don't want you to be upset.

280
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:44,364  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
How can I not be upset?

281
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:47,570  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:524
I finally fall in love
with this fantastic woman...

282
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:49,882  X1:204 X2:510 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and it turns out
she wanted you first.

283
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:52,930  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, for like a half an hour
one night.

284
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:56,961  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Chandler, she wants you
for the rest of her life.

285
00:17:57,492 --> 00:18:00,928  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
We look at you and we
see you together, and it just...

286
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:04,649  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:484 Y2:524
...it fits, you know?

287
00:18:05,052 --> 00:18:08,249  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:446 Y2:524
And you just know
it's gonna last forever.

288
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:13,043  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's what you should say.

289
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:15,446  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

290
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:21,249  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
When you're marrying us,
that's what you should say.

291
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:24,044  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really? I could do it?

292
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,446  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'd love you to do it.

293
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:28,651  X1:315 X2:401 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey.

294
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:35,485  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:524
But those are the words.
Those exact words.

295
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:38,841  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:524
Well, I don't remember exactly but...

296
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:44,807  X1:099 X2:615 Y1:444 Y2:524
...it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

297
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:54,410  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
- So you guys doing okay?
- Yeah.

298
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:58,281  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:524
We talked and Monica made me
see that I overreacted a little bit.

299
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:02,287  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Some things are more important.
- Yeah, baby.

300
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:08,601  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm really glad you guys are okay,
but I just keep thinking...

301
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:11,889  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:524
...what would've happened
if you two had hooked up.

302
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:16,570  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:524
Honey, dinner's ready!

303
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:24,761  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:524
What's my little chef
got for me tonight?

304
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:26,286  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Your favorite.
- Ho, ho, ho...

305
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:28,964  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:488 Y2:524
...fried stuff with cheese.

306
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:32,125  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
And lots of it!

307
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,891  X1:210 X2:504 Y1:486 Y2:524
Thanks, sweetheart.

308
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,771  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:484 Y2:524
Give me a little sugar... .

309
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:42,682  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:484 Y2:524
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

310
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,688  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
How you doing?

311
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,011  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey.
- Hey!

312
00:19:56,252 --> 00:20:00,689  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry to do this again, but
could you look after Ben for a bit?

313
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,484  X1:130 X2:585 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've got this meeting at school...

314
00:20:02,732 --> 00:20:05,565  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and he asked for his
fun Aunt Rachel.

315
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:08,367  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, of course I will watch him.

316
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:10,489  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:486 Y2:524
We have fun, don't we, Ben?

317
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,848  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:446 Y2:524
- See you later, pal.
- Okay.

318
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,806  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.

319
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,287  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You got something on your back.
- What?

320
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,764  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:524
That's great. That is great.

321
00:20:24,972 --> 00:20:27,281  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:052 Y2:131
What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?

322
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:30,285  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:052 Y2:132
"What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?"

323
00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:32,485  X1:199 X2:515 Y1:052 Y2:089
That's it! Come here!

324
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,166  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:052 Y2:129
- You're in big trouble, young man!
- No, wait.

325
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:37,448  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:052 Y2:093
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!

326
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,762  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:052 Y2:093
You guys, hold it. Seriously...

327
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,441  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:052 Y2:093
Oh, my God!

00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:05,403  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
Guys, you won't believe this!

2
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:08,365  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I just talked to my agent...
- Oh, my God!

3
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,647  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.

4
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:15,641  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:523
I got nominated for
<i>Days of Our Lives</i>!

5
00:00:16,252 --> 00:00:18,561  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Good for you!

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,522  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe you're nominated
for an Emmy!

7
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:25,921  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
- <i>Soap Opera Digest</i> Award?
- No. I'm up for a "Soapie. "

8
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:30,087  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is that something you're making up?

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,611  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:523
No, no, no, it's real!
And it has been, since 1998.

10
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,085  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm up for a Soapie!

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,202  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:44,968  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
My God! That's the third most
prestigious soap opera award there is!

13
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:48,921  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:523
Thank you! I guess we know
who I'll take to the awards!

14
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:52,209  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
Don't kid about that!
Will all the stars be there?

15
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:54,528  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
Many are scheduled to appear.

16
00:00:56,532 --> 00:01:00,161  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I can't go. I'll be too nervous!
- I'll go.

17
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,125  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're getting married.
This is all I have.

00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:47,123  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:054 Y2:132
Ernest Muhlbrat hypothesized that the
velociraptor, when threatened...

21
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:51,411  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:054 Y2:132
...would expand its collar and
emit a high-pitched noise...

22
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,443  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:094
...to frighten off predators.

23
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:54,881  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr. Lewis?

24
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,285  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
What kind of noise?

25
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:01,891  X1:212 X2:502 Y1:054 Y2:132
Just a high-pitched,
intimidating noise.

26
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,680  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
But like how?

27
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,326  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:054 Y2:092
Well, we don't know for sure.

28
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:11,841  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:054 Y2:132
But in my head,
it sounded something like this:

29
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:27,725  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:054 Y2:094
Of course, this is just conjecture.

30
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:32,408  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:095
Okay. That's all for today.

31
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:36,730  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Mr. Morse,
can I see you for a moment?

32
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,481  X1:287 X2:429 Y1:054 Y2:091
Yes, sir?

33
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:44,521  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:054 Y2:132
I need to talk to you
about your midterm exam.

34
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:48,921  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:133
- I'm afraid I had to fail you.
- Why?

35
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:52,007  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:054 Y2:094
Well, you need 60% to pass.

36
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:54,123  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:523
- What did I get?
- Seven.

37
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,329  X1:214 X2:500 Y1:054 Y2:095
That's not so good.

38
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:01,285  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:054 Y2:133
No, no, it's not.
What happened, Ned?

39
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:06,323  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:054 Y2:127
Maybe you can cut me some slack.
I'm sort of in love.

40
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,284  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm sorry, but that's
really not my problem.

41
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,530  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm in love with you.

42
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:17,126  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
That brings me in the loop a little.

43
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:22,130  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's why I did so bad on this test.
I'm having a hard time concentrating.

44
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:25,603  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:523
When you're up there
and you're teaching...

45
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:28,042  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and your face gets all serious... .

46
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:32,888  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:523
You look so good. When you wear that
tight little turtleneck sweater...

47
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:39,931  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.

48
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:41,651  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:486 Y2:523
You're a student.

49
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:43,683  X1:225 X2:490 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I like women.

50
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:47,931  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:523
In spite of what may be written
on the backs of these chairs.

51
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,483  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:444 Y2:523
That guy at the counter's
totally checking you out.

52
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:56,488  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

53
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:01,208  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Oh, my God, he's really cute!
- Go for it.

54
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,771  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe, I'm engaged.

55
00:04:03,972 --> 00:04:06,486  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm saying, get his number,
just in case.

56
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,971  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
But if Chandler's in an accident
and can't perform sexually...

57
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:16,967  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
...he'd want you to take a lover to
satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill.

58
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,928  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can I just tell you something?

59
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:26,891  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged.

60
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,523  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is kind of embarrassing.

61
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:33,610  X1:203 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
I actually came over
to talk to your friend.

62
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:38,050  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:523
You should be embarrassed.

63
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:45,929  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I thought you knew I looked at you.
- I did, but that was really fun.

64
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:51,090  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
"The winner is... Joey Tribbiani! "

65
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:59,563  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
"I honestly never expected this.

66
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,930  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
I didn't prepare a speech.

67
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:06,250  X1:120 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'd like to thank my parents,
who've always been there for me.

68
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:11,361  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:448 Y2:523
Also like to thank my friends,
Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel..."

69
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:13,130  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'm fourth?
- Jeez!

70
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,852  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look at you with your
maple syrup award!

71
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:21,169  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:448 Y2:523
Maybe you don't tell anyone
about this?

72
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:24,205  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
No big deal.
I do that with my shampoo bottle.

73
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:25,242  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Really?
- Yeah.

74
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,370  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What award are you practicing for?
- Grammy.

75
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:31,404  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:523
For Best New Artist.

76
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:37,363  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
The Soapies people called today.
I also get to present an award.

77
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:40,530  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
So you'll get on stage
even if you don't win.

78
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:47,125  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
- You don't think I'll win?
- Of course I do.

79
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:51,721  X1:125 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
But Favorite Returning Character?
That's a tough category.

80
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:55,408  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're up against the guy who
survived his own cremation.

81
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:59,529  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I know I might not win.
But it's just... .

82
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,725  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:448 Y2:523
I've never been nominated.
I want it so much.

83
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:04,405  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
You'll probably get it.

84
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:08,167  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
But you should start practicing
your "gracious-loser" face.

85
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:12,001  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
When the cameras are on you,
you want to look disappointed.

86
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:15,727  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:523
But also that your colleague
deserved to win. Like:

87
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,088  X1:271 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know?

88
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:26,207  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You practice losing the Grammys too?
- No, at the Grammys, I always win.

89
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:34,280  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hey!
- How'd your date go with Jake?

90
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:37,365  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
Great. We couldn't keep
our eyes off each other.

91
00:06:37,612 --> 00:06:42,527  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
Every once in a while, he'd lean over,
stroke my hair, then touch my neck.

92
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:45,690  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Stop it. You're getting me
all tingly.

93
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,005  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
All I could think of was,
is he gonna kiss me?

94
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,806  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Did he?
- I'm a lady. I don't kiss and tell.

95
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,162  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
But this hickey speaks for itself.

96
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,283  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, I got it. I got it.

97
00:06:56,732 --> 00:07:00,645  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
I like him so much, I feel like
I've had 10 drinks today.

98
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,080  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:482 Y2:523
I've only had six.

99
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:07,881  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:448 Y2:523
I haven't had that feeling since
I first went out with Chandler.

100
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:13,003  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'll never have that feeling again.
- You sound like a guy.

101
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:17,091  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, a guy would say, "I'll never
get to sleep with anyone else. "

102
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:19,687  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll never sleep with anyone else!

103
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:25,643  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm so busy planning the wedding,
I forgot about what I'll give up.

104
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,801  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll never have a first kiss again.

105
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:31,208  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:486 Y2:523
You'll have a last kiss.

106
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,642  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can I ask you something? Has
a guy ever had a crush on you?

107
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:41,843  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

108
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:47,122  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:523
A kid in my class said
he's in love with me.

109
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:48,287  X1:301 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whoa!

110
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,921  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Whoa, what?
- Ross has a boyfriend!

111
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:53,848  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
I do not have a boyfriend.

112
00:07:54,052 --> 00:07:57,806  X1:115 X2:602 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's a guy in one of my classes
who has a crush on me.

113
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,525  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Really?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:02,292  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid... .

115
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:06,002  X1:139 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
What is it?
Am I giving out some kind of...

116
00:08:06,212 --> 00:08:08,772  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:482 Y2:523
...sexy-professor vibe?

117
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,284  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
Not right now.

118
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:18,607  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:523
The point is, my natural charisma has
made him fail his midterm.

119
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:20,723  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now I feel bad for the kid.

120
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:24,083  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:523
I had a crush on a teacher once,
and it was so hard.

121
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:28,371  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
I couldn't concentrate.
I blushed every time he looked at me.

122
00:08:28,572 --> 00:08:31,689  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:523
You remember what it's like
to be 19 and in love.

123
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,682  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:523
- I can cut him some slack.
- Yeah.

124
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:41,887  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:523
- How'd you get over that teacher?
- I didn't. I got under him.

125
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:44,601  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:523
Problem solved.

126
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,441  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Bye, Phoebe.
- Okay, bye.

127
00:08:55,532 --> 00:08:58,330  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:444 Y2:523
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

128
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:08,571  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
We said goodbye at the door
so as not to flaunt our new love.

129
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:12,367  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's okay.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.

130
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:14,847  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:448 Y2:523
I've thought about it.
You know what?

131
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:17,202  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm okay, not having that
new-relationship feeling.

132
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:20,962  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I miss you already!
- I miss you too!

133
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:28,485  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:448 Y2:523
That's great, but I wouldn't
trade what I have for that.

134
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:32,765  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'll be with Chandler the rest
of my life. That makes me happy.

135
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:38,123  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come sit down. We're talking
about how our relationship's deep...

136
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,926  X1:203 X2:514 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and meaningful.
It is, don't you think?

137
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,281  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, totally.

138
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:44,488  X1:250 X2:465 Y1:482 Y2:523
Pull my finger.

139
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:55,360  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523

140
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,164  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Got your speech?
- Got my speech.

141
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:58,725  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Got your gracious-loser face?

142
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:04,325  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Try to remember, if you win,
you have to hug me.

143
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:06,364  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can I squeeze your ass?

144
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:08,687  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
On TV?

145
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:10,641  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah!

155
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:05,371  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:450 Y2:523
Any one of the brilliant actresses

156
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:10,003  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
...deserves to take it home.
Unfortunately, only one can.

157

162
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,565  X1:086 X2:626 Y1:482 Y2:523
Jessica Ashley from <i>Days of Our Lives. </i>

163
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:39,289  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
Unfortunately, Jessica
couldn't be with us tonight...

164
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,960  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:448 Y2:523
...so I'll accept this award
on her behalf.

165
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:48,212  X1:161 X2:553 Y1:486 Y2:523
And I'm sure that Jessica...

166
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,602  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
...wants to thank my parents...

167
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:52,888  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
...who always believed in me.

168
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:55,050  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
She'd also like to thank my friends:

169
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:59,291  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:523
Chandler, Monica, Ross,
Phoebe and Rachel...

170
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,483  X1:168 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
...who's sitting right there.

171
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:15,730  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why'd we rush out so fast?

172
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:20,050  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:523
We had to get out of there
because... Look what I won!

173
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:24,929  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God. You stole her award!

174
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:28,841  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, no, no. I'm accepting it
on her behalf.

175
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:32,047  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:448 Y2:523
I don't think you know
what "behalf" means.

176
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:36,251  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:448 Y2:523
Sure I do. It's a verb.
As in "I be half-in' it"!

177
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:44,450  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You've got to take this back.
- I should've won. I really wanted it.

178
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:48,924  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
She didn't care enough to come to the
thing. It could also be a Grammy.

179
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:53,607  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, Joey.

180
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:57,441  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:523
No one saw me take it.
There's a whole table of them.

181
00:12:57,692 --> 00:13:00,047  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you want an award you didn't win?

182
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:04,490  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I want an award I did win.
But nobody's given me any of those!

183
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:09,087  X1:096 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
If I put it up, when people come over,
they'll see it...

184
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,725  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
...and think I won it.

185
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:13,844  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey, it says
"Best Supporting Actress. "

186
00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:16,202  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can scratch that right off.

187
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:19,761  X1:178 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:523
This is wrong.
You have to take it back.

188
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:24,250  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
You don't want to win an award
this way. You're very talented.

189
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:29,441  X1:090 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
Someday you'll win one of these for
real and that one will mean something.

190
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:34,645  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Oh, all right.
- All right? Thank you.

191
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:37,643  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'll take it back tomorrow.

192
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:51,680  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:444 Y2:523
If I can't have it,
you can't have it!

193
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:02,046  X1:091 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Professor Geller?
- Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?

194
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:05,489  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know I didn't do well
on my midterms and stuff.

195
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:08,729  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
But I was hoping you could
change my grade.

196
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,287  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
And why, exactly, would I do that?

197
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:13,603  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
Because I'm in love with you.

198
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:17,208  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

199
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:21,881  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah. I'm all in love
with you and stuff.

200
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:26,612  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:523
- So could you change my grade?
- No!

201
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:29,643  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why not? You changed Ned's grade.

202
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:33,771  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's different. Because he was
actually in love with me.

203
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:36,845  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, he's not!
He's totally yanking your chain.

204
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:39,612  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:448 Y2:523
He's done this with
three other teachers.

205
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:43,488  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What?
- He's got a girlfriend.

206
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:48,045  X1:171 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe someone
would do that for a grade.

207
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,446  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know.

208
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:50,971  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:486 Y2:523
It's awful.

209
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,080  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

210
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:59,809  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, why?

211
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:02,924  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
I keep thinking about all
the things I won't have.

212
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,925  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:448 Y2:523
It's freaking me out.
I don't know what to do.

213
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:07,247  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:486 Y2:523
Don't sweat it.

214
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:12,003  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Chandler's not around, so get it
out of your system. That guy's cute.

215
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:15,210  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:484 Y2:523
Come on, I'm serious.

216
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:20,604  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I've got to talk to him about this.
- That's the last thing you want to do.

217
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:24,402  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Why?
- Because you're marrying him!

218
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,009  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:523
You gotta help me out here.

219
00:15:27,612 --> 00:15:30,763  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
I've never been engaged.
I've never really been married.

220
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,532  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can only tell you
what my mother told me.

221
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:37,845  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
When you have doubts or fears or
anxieties about a relationship...

222
00:15:38,092 --> 00:15:40,606  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
...don't communicate them
to your husband.

223
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:45,164  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not supposed to share
my doubts and fears...

224
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:48,284  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
...with the guy I'm spending
the rest of my life with?

225
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:50,130  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:488 Y2:523
That is correct. Yes.

226
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:54,490  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're supposed to put all that stuff
in a little box in your mind...

227
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:55,886  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and lock it up.

228
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,570  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
Your mother told you this?

229
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:03,129  X1:068 X2:649 Y1:444 Y2:523
The woman who married a bunch of times
and killed herself when you were 13?

230
00:16:04,412 --> 00:16:05,925  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, you're right.

231
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,851  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Tell Chandler.
Hurry, before it's too late!

232
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:13,568  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wait! Does this also mean that
putting out doesn't get you love?

233
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,570  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:523
- I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
- Wait, wait.

234
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,321  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:523
Rach, please be cool, okay?
I work with this woman.

235
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:27,324  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, I'm totally cool.

236
00:16:28,412 --> 00:16:29,322  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come in.

237
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:31,887  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Jessica.

238
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:33,167  X1:276 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hey, Jess.

239
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:35,640  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is my friend Rachel.

240
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:37,365  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hi.
- What's up?

241
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,930  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:523
Here's your Soapie.
I accepted it for you.

242
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:48,011  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God. I won?
Do you have any idea what this means?

243
00:16:51,132 --> 00:16:54,329  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're not gonna put it
on your shelf or anything?

244
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:58,724  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, I try to save that for real
awards. Now if you'll excuse me?

245
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:03,570  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Take it back?
- Absolutely.

246
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:10,085  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, you do!

247
00:17:12,892 --> 00:17:15,770  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
Honey?
As we get closer to the wedding...

248
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:18,440  X1:215 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
...is there anything
you'd like to share?

249
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:22,401  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay. I think the centerpieces
are too big.

250
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:25,331  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're wrong.
The centerpieces are fine.

251
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:30,726  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Do you ever get scared at all?
- Kind of. They're really big.

252
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:37,487  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Doesn't it freak you out that you'll
never be with anybody new again?

253
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:39,248  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

254
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,211  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you so much.

255
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:47,320  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Sometimes it bothers me that
I'll never have that feeling.

256
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,523  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
When you first meet someone...

257
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:53,128  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:523
...and it's new and exciting.
You know that rush?

258
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:58,520  X1:120 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, when I first meet somebody...

259
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:02,930  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
...it's mostly panic, anxiety
and a great deal of sweating.

260
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:06,124  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. But you're a guy.

261
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:10,371  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Aren't you freaked out that you'll
never sleep with anybody else?

262
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:12,927  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:482 Y2:523
Sleeping with somebody, no.

263
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:16,920  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid,
even more sweating.

264
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:19,526  X1:249 X2:468 Y1:488 Y2:523
Even with me?

265
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:24,123  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was dangerously dehydrated the
first six months of our relationship.

266
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:30,447  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:444 Y2:523
For me, the rush is knowing that we'll
be together the rest of our lives.

267
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,409  X1:266 X2:450 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

268
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:38,403  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
Knowing you're having these thoughts,
we're back to panic, anxiety and...

269
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:41,888  X1:172 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I'll definitely need
some kind of sports drink.

270
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,562  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come here. Oh, you don't
have to worry.

271
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:52,323  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
Besides, you know what? I'll have
a lot of new things with you.

272
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:56,844  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
The first time we buy a house. Our
first kid. Our first grandkid.

273
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,407  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:523
Water. Water. Water.

274
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:04,084  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:450 Y2:523
Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you
for a moment?

275
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:11,170  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
That was a great lecture today.
Did you get a little haircut?

276
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:14,808  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yeah, yeah. Do you like it?
Do you love it?

277
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:19,045  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
I want you to know I'm
changing your grade back.

278
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,527  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? Why?

279
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:25,322  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know what you're trying
to pull here. It won't work.

280
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:29,730  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not trying to pull anything.
Look, I love you, dude.

281
00:19:30,772 --> 00:19:34,924  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not even gonna talk about this.
This little "thing" is over.

282
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:39,643  X1:085 X2:629 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know you have a girlfriend.
And I know about the other professors.

283
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:43,168  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:523
How do you think that makes me feel?
You used me!

284
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:45,681  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:523
You don't love me and you never did!

285
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:51,360  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:523
Professor Winston.
Professor Frederickson.

286
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,403  X1:207 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll be right with you.

287
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,843  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
Don't make this worse and I'll
give you a "C. " Shall we?

288
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:07,764  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'll be out in a second.

289
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:15,721  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
"It's just so unexpected!

290
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:21,925  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'll tell you, it's such
an honor to just be nominated...

291
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:24,407  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
...for a Nobel Prize.

292
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:30,125  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:132
And, you know, to win one
for a massage!

293
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:34,286  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:054 Y2:132
Especially just after winning a
Tony Award for Best Actress..."

294
00:20:34,492 --> 00:20:36,244  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:054 Y2:089
Our reservations are at 8.

295
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:39,922  X1:174 X2:547 Y1:054 Y2:133
"...in <i>Reservations at Eight</i>
by Neil Simon.

296
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:43,727  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:054 Y2:132
Thank you, Neil.
Thank you for the words. "

297
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:46,932  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:054 Y2:132
Finish this later.
We're gonna be late.

298
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:50,329  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:054 Y2:133
Please don't play the music.
Just one more thing.

299
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:54,127  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:054 Y2:133
Okay. "Live from New York,
it's <i>Saturday Night</i>! "

1
00:00:06,252 --> 00:00:10,450  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524
Out of all of us, who do you think
will get married next?

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,480  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:484 Y2:524
Probably Monica and Chandler.

3
00:00:16,572 --> 00:00:19,086  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:484 Y2:524
Could I have a pack of Newport Lights?

4
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:23,080  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:524
We don't sell cigarettes,
but they do across the street.

5
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,806  X1:176 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:524
That'd be great. Thanks.

6
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:31,405  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
Melissa Worbert. I don't think
I have the energy for this.

7
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:36,162  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene?

8
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:43,963  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:524
You've been MIA
for seven sorority newsletters.

9
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:46,248  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
What's up with you?

10
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,886  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why don't I tell you over here?

11
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:54,129  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:446 Y2:524
So last I heard
you were gonna get married.

12
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:55,964  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:484 Y2:524
Poor Ray-Ray.

13
00:00:56,572 --> 00:00:58,688  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, no. It's all good.

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,645  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
- Shut up!

15
00:01:01,852 --> 00:01:05,731  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:524
I will not. I'm the divisional head
of men's sportswear.

16
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,447  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
Shut up more!
Are you friends with Ralph?

17
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,961  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Oh, please.
- Are you?

18
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,685  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

19
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:17,722  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
We have to have dinner.
What are you doing tomorrow?

20
00:01:17,932 --> 00:01:21,447  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Tomorrow. I don't know.
- You're having dinner with me.

21
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,804  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
Shut up.

22
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:27,084  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
I've gotta go.
This has been so great.

23
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:29,681  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, there you are.

24
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:32,964  X1:197 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
So listen, just call me.
Here's my card.

25
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:36,323  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You're in real estate?
- No, that's an old card.

26
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:39,928  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:524
I got out of that to do something
where I could...

27
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:42,686  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:484 Y2:524
...help people and make a difference.

28
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:44,405  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:484 Y2:524
What do you do now?

29
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:47,287  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm a party planner.

30
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:50,046  X1:196 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

31
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:54,089  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.

32
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,970  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:446 Y2:524
That was my friend, Melissa,
from college.

33
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:00,891  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:484 Y2:524
She seems really, really fun!

34
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:05,128  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:524
She's actually sweet,
and we used to be very close.

35
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:09,291  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wait a minute.
She's not the one who you...?

36
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:12,285  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
Who you what? Who you what?

37
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:15,129  X1:301 X2:414 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yes.
- Wow!

38
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:17,840  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wow, what? Who you what?

39
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,202  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, it's not a big deal.

40
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:21,561  X1:227 X2:488 Y1:484 Y2:524
They were lovers.

41
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:23,364  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What?
- What?

42
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:25,483  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, we weren't. It was nothing.

43
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:29,281  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was one night, senior year,
and we went to a party...

44
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:33,690  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:446 Y2:524
...had a lot of sangria,
and you know, ended up...

45
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:35,445  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:524
...kissing for a bit.

46
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:38,724  X1:165 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:524
So that's two of my wives.

47
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:42,282  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:524
The One With Rachel's Kisses

48
00:02:44,812 --> 00:02:45,801  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:446 Y2:524

49
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:23,682  X1:155 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:126
So this is where the band is.
And here's the bar.

50
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:28,881  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:052 Y2:132
And all these pins have people's names
on them. Rach, here you are.

51
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:33,562  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
Why don't we just put me
with a Manhattan in my hand...

52
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,650  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
...talking to the cute bartender.

53
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:42,285  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
These pins aren't for playing,
are they?

54
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:45,410  X1:192 X2:523 Y1:446 Y2:524
The red are my guests,
and the blue are yours.

55
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:48,331  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:052 Y2:131
This is so sad.
I only have like 10 pins.

56
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:51,325  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:052 Y2:091
Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.

57
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:53,688  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:052 Y2:093
Certainly not a close one.

58
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:01,884  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Rach.

59
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:06,087  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:052 Y2:093
Stop picturing it!

60
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:13,083  X1:119 X2:600 Y1:052 Y2:132
I think that's it. The seating chart
is done. This is our wedding.

61
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,965  X1:104 X2:610 Y1:052 Y2:094
They all look like they're having fun.

62
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,130  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:052 Y2:093
So where are my parents gonna be?

63
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,284  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:052 Y2:093
Well, if this is the wedding hall...

64
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:26,241  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
...your parents would be over here
at home in Queens.

65
00:04:26,452 --> 00:04:30,411  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:052 Y2:132
They're not invited?
Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!

66
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:33,126  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:052 Y2:094
Why would they think they're invited?

67
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:35,647  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:052 Y2:094
You got me. I don't... .

68
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:38,889  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Joey!
- Look, I thought parents were coming.

69
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:42,004  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:052 Y2:131
Your parents are coming.
Chandler's are coming.

70
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,527  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:052 Y2:094
Ross' parents are coming.

71
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:48,202  X1:148 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:524
Ross' parents are my parents.

72
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:51,081  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, see, parents are coming.

73
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:55,281  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:446 Y2:524
- We should invite them.
- You just want more blue pins.

74
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:57,881  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, this is just sad.

75
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:03,129  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
All right. Maybe I can fit them in
if I just do some rearranging.

76
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:05,687  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
Rachel may have to sit at the bar.

77
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:08,326  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
That is not a problem.

78
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:12,491  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
- Get out of here!

79
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:20,723  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
These are our tuxedos. If you like
anything, we can make a deal.

80
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:25,403  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:446 Y2:524
Anything at all. But these are
the three that Monica pre-approved.

81
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,488  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Thanks a lot for hooking me up.

82
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:33,567  X1:081 X2:633 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I want you to know that I want
you to attend our wedding as my guest.

83
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:38,284  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm Monica's maid of honor.

84
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:41,370  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.

85
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,204  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Well, these look nice.
- They are nice.

86
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:49,803  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:446 Y2:524
When celebrities are done with them,
they send them back.

87
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:52,890  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You mean like for award shows?
- Some of them.

88
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:56,368  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:524
They've been down the red carpet
with people yelling...

89
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:59,490  X1:177 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
..."Who are you wearing?
You look fabulous! "

90
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,929  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
Might I suggest watching
a little more ESPN...

91
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:05,288  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and a little less E! .

92
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,443  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. Who wore those?

93
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:13,285  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.
- Not bad.

94
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,484  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:524
This one is Paul O'Neil.

95
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:19,087  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:488 Y2:524
Who's that?

96
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:23,171  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
He plays for the Yankees.
Seriously, ESPN.

97
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:26,961  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just once in a while.
Have it on in the background.

98
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:32,528  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This one was Pierce Brosnan.
- Pierce Brosnan?

99
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,887  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you serious?

100
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:34,962  X1:311 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:524
007?

101
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:40,286  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:524
This is James Bond's tux? I have to
get married in James Bond's tux.

102
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,005  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's a pretty cool tux.

103
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:46,768  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's not just that. I would be
England's most powerful weapon.

104
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:50,931  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
A jet-setting heartbreaker
on Her Majesty's secret service.

105
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:54,881  X1:177 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:524
A man who fears no one,
with a license to kill.

106
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,292  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
Would Monica let me wear this?

107
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:06,529  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
We should really learn
how to play the real way.

108
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:08,888  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:484 Y2:524
I like our way.

109
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:12,083  X1:300 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chess!

110
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,963  X1:267 X2:449 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Nice move.
- Yeah.

111
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:22,766  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
I hooked Ross and Chandler up
with tuxedos. Do you need one?

112
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,042  X1:171 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:524
No, I'm not wearing a tux.

113
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:28,881  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What are you gonna wear?
- Multi-colored robes.

114
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,844  X1:227 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
And maybe a hat.

115
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:33,162  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Does Monica know about this?
- No.

116
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,966  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can I please be there
when you tell her?

117
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:40,208  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to go to a movie tonight?

118
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:42,761  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm having dinner with Melissa.

119
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:44,690  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:488 Y2:524
Can I come?

120
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:48,764  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:524
I won't talk.
You'll just hear my video camera.

121
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:51,770  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
- What? What's going on?
- Can I tell her?

122
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,362  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you want what happened,
or Joey's lewd version?

123
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,721  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:524
Joey's.

124
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,810  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:484 Y2:524
I had this college friend...

125
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,806  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
...and I made the mistake
of telling Joey that one time...

126
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:07,886  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
...she and l, you know,
kissed a little bit.

127
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:11,602  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.

128
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:14,844  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:450 Y2:524
- It did.
- Sure.

129
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:19,884  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey. It happened.

130
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:24,801  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:446 Y2:524
It was senior year.
It was after the Sigma Chi luau...

131
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:27,327  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.

132
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:31,451  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
And we ended up kissing.
For several minutes.

133
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:35,884  X1:081 X2:636 Y1:446 Y2:524
Which means she had a couple spritzers
and a peck on the cheek.

134
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:39,131  X1:083 X2:633 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why are you taking this away from me?

135
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:42,002  X1:105 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Why is it so hard for you to believe?

136
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:46,285  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay. I just didn't know
that you were a lesbian.

137
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:56,920  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
I'm just saying that this happened.

138
00:08:57,132 --> 00:09:01,410  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
It just seems pretty wild.
And you're so...

139
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:02,607  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:488 Y2:524
...vanilla.

140
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:08,482  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
I do lots of crazy things.

141
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:11,445  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
I mean, I got drunk
and married in Vegas.

142
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:14,162  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:524
To Ross.

143
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,484  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
If you don't believe me...

144
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:20,520  X1:097 X2:623 Y1:446 Y2:524
...just come with me to dinner tonight
and she'll tell you.

145
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,882  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay. Because I can't picture it.

146
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,885  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:484 Y2:524
You should get inside my head.

147
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,682  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:484 Y2:524
Guess what I got for your wedding?

148
00:09:33,932 --> 00:09:36,890  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:446 Y2:524
A freakishly thin date
with a hanger for a head?

149
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:40,767  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
But not just any tux.

150
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:42,769  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:524
Batman's tux!

151
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:44,731  X1:259 X2:457 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What?
- That's right.

152
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:49,682  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
and worn by him in the hit film...

153
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,287  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:488 Y2:524
...that Batman film he was in.

154
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:56,840  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
You can't wear that.
I'm wearing the famous tux.

155
00:09:57,052 --> 00:10:00,601  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you wear that,
it'll make mine less special.

156
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:03,087  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:446 Y2:524
You need something to
to make it special?

157
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,886  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
You have
the most special thing of all.

158
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:09,169  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:484 Y2:524
You are marrying the woman you love.

159
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:16,090  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:524
Don't take away my cool thing.
Pretty please?

160
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:20,325  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Pretty please?" Not very 007.

161
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:24,525  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you were getting married,
I'd never do anything to upset you.

162
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:29,123  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
- You slept with my sister.
- That was pretty 007.

163
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:35,888  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right, I figured it out.

164
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:38,890  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
add your parents...

165
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:41,287  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and make them into 3 tables of 6.

166
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:44,325  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
And I called the caterer.
We are good to go!

167
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:47,046  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:482 Y2:524
Yeah. They're not coming.

168
00:10:48,572 --> 00:10:49,402  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

169
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:53,088  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:524
They think that you only
invited them because of me.

170
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,884  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:484 Y2:524
They feel unwanted.

171
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:58,801  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:524
That's too bad.
It's true. But too bad.

172
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:01,486  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:484 Y2:524
If you could just call my mom.

173
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,292  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:446 Y2:524
Just let her know
you want them there.

174
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:07,768  X1:122 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
This is a woman
who has sent you many lasagnas.

175
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:08,882  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, she hasn't.

176
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,811  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
Is it her fault
if some didn't make it to you?

177
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:13,491  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:484 Y2:524
What am I gonna say?

178
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:18,123  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:446 Y2:524
Tell them you mixed up invitations.
No, blame it on the post office.

179
00:11:18,372 --> 00:11:21,967  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:450 Y2:524
They hate the post office.
And the Irish.

180
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:25,284  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
But I don't think
you could blame it on them.

181
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:32,088  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:524
Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbianni?
This is Monica Geller.

182
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:36,763  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm just calling to say that I really
hope you can make the wedding.

183
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:40,766  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:524
Apparently some of our invitations
weren't delivered.

184
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:45,369  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
I guess there was some screw-up
at the damn post office.

185
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,005  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:524
Tell me about it!

186
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:53,246  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
No. More like U.S. Lost Office.

187
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:56,366  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are they, Irish?

188
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:06,681  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:524
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
been going out for three years.

189
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,964  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:446 Y2:524
He was my first client
when I became a party planner.

190
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:14,171  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:446 Y2:524
He was actually planning a party
for his girlfriend at the time.

191
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,289  X1:285 X2:430 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, well.

192
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:22,006  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:446 Y2:524
- He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
- That's great.

193
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:24,925  X1:155 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Were you ever in a sorority?
- Of course.

194
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:29,324  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.

195
00:12:31,372 --> 00:12:32,327  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
What one?

196
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:35,683  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:446 Y2:524
We were huge too.
But they had to shut us down...

197
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:39,481  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:446 Y2:524
...when Regina Phalangie
died of alcohol poisoning.

198
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:43,691  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:450 Y2:524
Isn't it a shame when one girl
ruins it for the whole bunch?

199
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:48,685  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
Anyway... .

200
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:52,129  X1:139 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:524
Speaking of drinking too much,
I told Phoebe...

201
00:12:52,332 --> 00:12:56,769  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
...about that crazy night after the
Sigma Chi luau where we made out.

202
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:58,601  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

203
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:03,966  X1:062 X2:655 Y1:446 Y2:524
Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs
on and the coconut bikini tops.

204
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:07,130  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:446 Y2:524
We went back to the house
and got really silly...

205
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:09,408  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:524
...and we made out.

206
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:14,123  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

207
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:15,924  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:484 Y2:524
Really?

208
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,650  X1:240 X2:476 Y1:488 Y2:524
Ross is Batman.

209
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:30,289  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
Well, he did manage to keep
his identity secret for a long time.

210
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:34,684  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:524
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
that Val Kilmer wore in <i>Batman.</i>

211
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:37,526  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
Batman is so much cooler
than James Bond.

212
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:42,527  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:446 Y2:524
- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
- Batman has a utility belt.

213
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:47,283  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
- 007 has a fancy car.
- Batman has the Batmobile.

214
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:53,612  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:524
- 007 gets all the ladies.
- Batman has Robin.

215
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,571  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:524
We get ESPN, right?

216
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:07,766  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
How about you go put on your 007
tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini?

217
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,803  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:488 Y2:524
I don't like martinis.

218
00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:13,607  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:524
- A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw?
- Yum.

219
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,722  X1:128 X2:587 Y1:484 Y2:524
I know the invitation says 6 p.m.

220
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:22,760  X1:118 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:524
But does that mean get there at 6,
or the show starts at 6?

221
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:24,963  X1:273 X2:444 Y1:488 Y2:524
The show?

222
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:29,682  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:484 Y2:524
Right, the wedding. Gotcha.

223
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:33,009  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:446 Y2:524
But weddings start
a little late, right?

224
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,806  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:446 Y2:524
Have you ever
been to one of my weddings?

225
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:40,004  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:524
Well, it's the same day
as my niece's christening...

226
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:42,402  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:484 Y2:524
...and I want my parents to see me.

227
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:47,043  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:524
My part's in the beginning. I'm not
in the rest of the show... Wedding.

228
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,208  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:484 Y2:524
The wedding starts at 6.

229
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:51,767  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay. I totally hear you.

230
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:54,611  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:446 Y2:524
How about this?
I vamp till they get there.

231
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:56,607  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:524
You'll "vamp"?

232
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:59,685  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:446 Y2:524
Like warm up the crowd.
Ask where they're from.

233
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:04,090  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:450 Y2:524
In Joey Tribbianni, you get
a minister and an entertainer.

234
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,010  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:488 Y2:524
I'm a "ministainer."

235
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:10,530  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's no one better.
There's no one greater.

236
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:14,721  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:484 Y2:524
How can you not remember us kissing?

237
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:19,369  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't know. I don't remember
a lot of things that never happened.

238
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:24,769  X1:107 X2:610 Y1:446 Y2:524
Remember, we were on the sleeping
porch? We couldn't stop giggling.

239
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:27,327  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:484 Y2:524
Our coconuts kept knocking together.

240
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:30,729  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:482 Y2:524
Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.

241
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,092  X1:150 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable...

242
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:38,285  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:524
...but I told Phoebe it happened,
and she doesn't believe me.

243
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:43,083  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:524
I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
it happened, I would say it.

244
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:47,405  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
to me while I was sleeping.

245
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,764  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:524
It's okay, you don't have to do this.
I believe you.

246
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:55,721  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:446 Y2:524
If you say you kissed Melissa,
then you kissed Melissa.

247
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:58,810  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Thank you, Phoebe.
- Okay.

248
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:01,480  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:450 Y2:524
- But she didn't.
- I know.

249
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:07,205  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
You carry that around?

250
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:11,001  X1:186 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
I find it to be something
of a conversation piece.

251
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:15,601  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Between you and...?
- Gunther.

252
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:17,490  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:482 Y2:524
Why don't we put them on?

253
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:20,525  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:446 Y2:524
Get a picture of Batman
and James Bond, together.

254
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:23,087  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:446 Y2:524
I would, but my pants
are a little tight.

255
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:28,047  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:446 Y2:524
A little tight?
I could see 00 and 7 in those things.

256
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:32,723  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:446 Y2:524
I was looking forward to wearing
our celebrity tuxes together.

257
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:37,801  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:444 Y2:524
- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!

258
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,763  X1:238 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:524
Let me try it on.

259
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:45,881  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay. But just the jacket.
00 and 7 are not getting in there.

260
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:54,322  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:484 Y2:524
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!

261
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,366  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:524
What's this?

262
00:16:57,572 --> 00:17:00,291  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:446 Y2:524
An invitation to
the <i>At First Sight</i> premiere?

263
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:03,290  X1:209 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:524
Val Kilmer didn't
wear this in <i>Batman. </i>

264
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:08,282  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:446 Y2:524
He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
love story where he was a blind guy.

265
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:10,284  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let me see that.

266
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:13,085  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, man.

267
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:18,082  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:446 Y2:524
The only super power you have is the
slightly heightened sense of smell.

268
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,881  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:484 Y2:524
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

269
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:24,925  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:446 Y2:524
I give up.
Whatever you want, you can have it.

270
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,288  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:484 Y2:524
You want to sing a song or do a dance?

271
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:32,401  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:446 Y2:524
You want your mom at the altar
screaming racial slurs? I don't care.

272
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,884  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:446 Y2:524
I just want to thank you guys
for what you did for my parents.

273
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:40,482  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:524
They're so happy
to be a part of your special day.

274
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:43,602  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:524
Tell them we're glad they're coming.

275
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:48,846  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:446 Y2:524
I will. Oh, check out what they got
me to wear for the ceremony!

276
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:55,681  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:446 Y2:524
I wear it like this when I
marry you guys. And then this...

277
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:58,287  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
...is for party time.

278
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:07,641  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
It happened.
I am telling you it happened.

279
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,604  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:484 Y2:524
It was great meeting you.

280
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:13,686  X1:160 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
And, Rachel? I don't think
I'll be calling you because...

281
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,281  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:524
...you know, you've gotten weird.

282
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:19,291  X1:206 X2:509 Y1:484 Y2:524
Take care, you guys.

283
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,807  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:484 Y2:524
Wait a minute. Okay, look.

284
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:26,091  X1:123 X2:593 Y1:446 Y2:524
That night was the one wild thing
I've ever done in my life.

285
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,283  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:482 Y2:524
I won't let you take it away.

286
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:32,770  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:524
So if you don't remember that,
maybe you'll remember this... .

287
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:43,169  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God. You love me.

288
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:45,002  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

289
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:48,887  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
Of course I remember.
I think about it all the time.

290
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:53,563  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:446 Y2:524
I can still hear
the coconuts knocking together... .

291
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:59,606  X1:108 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:524
I didn't want to tell you, because I
didn't think you'd return my love... .

292
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:06,688  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:524
Look who's being suddenly shy.

293
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:09,281  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:488 Y2:524
You have to feel what I feel.

294
00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:12,290  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
Nobody can kiss that good
and not mean it.

295
00:19:12,532 --> 00:19:15,683  X1:198 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm just a good kisser.

296
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:18,127  X1:287 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
Shut up.

297
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,531  X1:281 X2:434 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:23,532 --> 00:19:26,888  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
You don't have to be sorry.

299
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,010  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm obviously kidding.

300
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,211  X1:183 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm not in love with you.
I'm not in love with her.

301
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:38,650  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't hear coconuts
banging together.

302
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:43,084  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't picture your face
when I make love to my boyfriend.

303
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,485  X1:213 X2:502 Y1:484 Y2:524
Anyway, I gotta go.

304
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:47,802  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:484 Y2:524
A kiss goodbye?

305
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:50,691  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:484 Y2:524
No? Okay.

306
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:03,681  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:450 Y2:524
I mean, I had no idea
that that would... .

307
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,885  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:524
What the hell was that?

308
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:14,289  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:524
Just wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

309
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:17,000  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:450 Y2:524
- And?
- I've had better.

310
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:25,891  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:524
I found one that fits.

311
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:30,728  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:052 Y2:126
Well, you know what they say?
23rd time's a charm.

312
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,562  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:052 Y2:093
Look at you, all handsome.

313
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:38,129  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Whose is it?
- Does it matter?

314
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:41,523  X1:146 X2:568 Y1:052 Y2:131
All that matters
is that you look so handsome.

315
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:47,729  X1:209 X2:506 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Whose is it?
- I don't want to say.

316
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:51,044  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:052 Y2:091
Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?

317
00:20:51,732 --> 00:20:53,609  X1:253 X2:462 Y1:052 Y2:088

00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:07,322  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:444 Y2:524
Do you realize we're
getting married in four weeks?

2
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:10,405  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

3
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:13,202  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:484 Y2:524
You realize you get louder each week?

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:17,568  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:524
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows?

5
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:22,129  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:524
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow. "

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:26,082  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:524
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to this.

7
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:32,168  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

8
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:36,004  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:446 Y2:524
Do you happen to know
what I'm gonna say?

9
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:40,241  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

10
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:42,289  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:524
Say what's in your heart.

16
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:47,443  X1:163 X2:551 Y1:052 Y2:126
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

17
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:52,326  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:052 Y2:132
You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

18
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:56,770  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:052 Y2:126
With Carol I promised never
to love another woman until I die.

19
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:58,730  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:052 Y2:093
She made no such promise.

20
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:03,969  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:052 Y2:132
I'm pathetic. Monica knows what
to say, you should have seen her.

21
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:08,450  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:052 Y2:094
What's the emergency?

22
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:12,446  X1:103 X2:611 Y1:052 Y2:126
You have to help me write my vows.
All I have is this.

23
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:16,241  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:052 Y2:131
I like the pretty drawing
of you in the wedding dress.

24
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:21,131  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Thank you.
- Except your breasts look small.

25
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:24,322  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:052 Y2:093
Those are my eyes!

26
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:29,487  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:052 Y2:131
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah.

27
00:02:32,132 --> 00:02:35,329  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:052 Y2:132
Why don't you start
with something simple?

28
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:40,566  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:052 Y2:132
"Monica, from the moment I met you
I knew I loved you. "

29
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:42,325  X1:246 X2:470 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't do that.

30
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,961  X1:169 X2:546 Y1:484 Y2:524
Everyone, this is Chandler.

31
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:47,128  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:486 Y2:524
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

32
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:49,325  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

33
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:54,849  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:524
Okay, okay.
Maybe you could start with:

34
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:57,771  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

35
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:01,209  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
...there was a part of me
that knew I wanted more. "

36
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:05,963  X1:096 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:524
All right, there's a nuclear

00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:08,128  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:524
Would you go out with me?

38
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,321  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:488 Y2:524
Are we allowed to lie in the vows?

39
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:20,924  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:524
Okay, don't talk about those feelings.
Just say something about...

40
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:24,124  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
...all the things
he's taught you, like...

41
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:32,241  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:484 Y2:524
Or all the things you taught him.

42
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,766  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:448 Y2:524
Everybody knows the erogenous zones.
One, two, three...

43
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:41,963  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:486 Y2:524
...four, five, six and seven.

44
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,924  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:488 Y2:524
There are seven?

45
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,928  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:524
- That's one?
- Kind of an important one.

46
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,882  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:484 Y2:524
I was looking at it upside down.

47
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:58,126  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:484 Y2:524
You know, sometimes that helps.

48
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,564  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, start out with a little one...

49
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,485  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:486 Y2:524
...a two, a one-two-three...

50
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:12,723  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:486 Y2:524
...a three, a five...

51
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:16,372  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:486 Y2:524
...a four, a three-two...

52
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:18,568  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:486 Y2:524
...two, a two-four-six.

53
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:23,008  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:486 Y2:524
Two-four-six, four, two...

54
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,726  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:486 Y2:524
...two, four-seven...

55
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,321  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:486 Y2:524
...five-seven, six-seven...

56
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:31,961  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:492 Y2:524
...seven, seven...

57
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:35,363  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:492 Y2:524
...seven, seven, seven...

58
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:36,925  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:524
...seven!

59
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:47,448  X1:170 X2:545 Y1:484 Y2:524
How about something like:

60
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:52,129  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:524
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together... . "

61
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,563  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Yeah?
- I can't do all of it.

62
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,007  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look back over your time together.

63
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:05,564  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, look, twins!

64
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:09,327  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

65
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:12,326  X1:243 X2:472 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

66
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:16,167  X1:154 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:524
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

67
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,971  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:446 Y2:524
...what do you say we have one?
- Why wouldn't I be married?

68
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,163  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:484 Y2:524
I just meant hypothetically.

69
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:27,250  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:446 Y2:524
Hypothetically,
why won't I be married?

70
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,521  X1:296 X2:420 Y1:486 Y2:524
No, no.

71
00:05:28,732 --> 00:05:32,168  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:524
What is it? Is there
something unmarriable about me?

72
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:35,331  X1:308 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well?

73
00:05:35,612 --> 00:05:38,729  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:446 Y2:524
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

74
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,162  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:524
I'm getting married today!

75
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,330  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:524
Think he knew I was here?

76
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:55,561  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:484 Y2:524
Nice try.

77
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,524  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:486 Y2:524
Wait, wait, wait.

78
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:01,527  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:486 Y2:524
Look, Monica...

79
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:09,128  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:524
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this'll work.

80
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:19,732  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:484 Y2:524
You are so great! I love you.

81
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:30,240  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:524
What?

82
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:34,041  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:524
I said you're so great,
and then I stopped talking.

83
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:39,284  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You said you love me!
- No, I didn't.

84
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,407  X1:253 X2:463 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

85
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,886  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:448 Y2:524
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

86
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:48,764  X1:236 X2:478 Y1:484 Y2:524
Stop it! Stop it!

87
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:56,726  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:446 Y2:524
You know, I was thinking,
what if I unpack here?

88
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:59,207  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:484 Y2:524
Then all your stuff would be here.

89
00:07:00,812 --> 00:07:02,131  X1:295 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:524
Well... .

90
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,330  X1:211 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:524
What if it was here?

91
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,924  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:524
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

92
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:11,925  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
Doesn't make any sense.

93
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,925  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay.

94
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:19,931  X1:098 X2:618 Y1:446 Y2:524
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

95
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,283  X1:162 X2:552 Y1:484 Y2:524
We wanted to surprise you.

96
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,771  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

97
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,525  X1:272 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler...

98
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,524  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:524
...in all my life...

99
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,932  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:482 Y2:524
...I never thought I'd be so lucky...

100
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:02,728  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:484 Y2:524
...as to fall in love with my best...

101
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:08,045  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
My best... There's a reason
why girls don't do this!

102
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:10,288  X1:160 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

103
00:08:11,412 --> 00:08:13,130  X1:275 X2:442 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought...

104
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:18,685  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can do this.

105
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,925  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:484 Y2:524
I thought...

106
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:29,126  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:524
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

107
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:34,726  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:446 Y2:524
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

108
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:42,725  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:446 Y2:524
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

109
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,409  X1:215 X2:499 Y1:484 Y2:524
And if you let me...

110
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:52,128  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:524
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

111
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:02,245  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:524
Monica?

112
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:05,565  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you marry me?

113
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,330  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

114
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,280  X1:201 X2:514 Y1:446 Y2:524
Can we come in?
We're dying out here!

115
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:26,925  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:524
Come in! Come in!

116
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:30,329  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:450 Y2:524
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

117
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:43,649  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

118
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:47,049  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:524
Helping Chandler write his vows.
He kicked us out.

119
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:49,891  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:446 Y2:524
Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

120
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:55,521  X1:141 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:524
How is "Monica, I love
your sweet ass" inappropriate?

121
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:58,845  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:524
How's Monica doing?

122
00:09:59,052 --> 00:10:02,806  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:524
Lucky she's got a sweet ass.
She's not so good at writing.

123
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:06,845  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:524
In four weeks
they're gonna be married!

124
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:09,128  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:524
Let's just hope it works.

125
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,971  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:524
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

126
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:13,605  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's not true.

127
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,928  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:524
You're right. How's the missis?

128
00:10:17,772 --> 00:10:18,807  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe...

129
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:21,242  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:524
...they're together 3 years.
- That long?

130
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:24,762  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:446 Y2:524
It seems like less
because they hid it from us.

131
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,326  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:524
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

132
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:37,126  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:524
I've had a very long, hard day.

133
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:41,208  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm getting some chicken. Want some?
- No. Bye, then.

134
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:49,328  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

135
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:51,766  X1:286 X2:432 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chicken?

136
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,530  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:524
I could eat some chicken.

137
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:57,331  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:484 Y2:524
Hey, Joe!

138
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:03,606  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:448 Y2:524
Can I get a three-piece,
coleslaw, beans and a Coke?

139
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:05,931  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:524
Diet Coke.

140
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:13,931  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Why didn't they tell us?
- I know, we were cool about it.

141
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:16,925  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:484 Y2:524
You? And you?

142
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:20,087  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:524
You cannot tell. No one knows.

143
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:22,044  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:524
How? When?

144
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:24,722  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:524
- It happened in London.
- In London?!

145
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:30,968  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:524
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

146
00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:33,322  X1:220 X2:495 Y1:484 Y2:524
But it is a big deal!

147
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:36,127  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:448 Y2:524
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

148
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,051  X1:271 X2:444 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You can't.
- Please!

149
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:42,922  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:524
We don't want to deal with telling
them. Just promise you won't tell.

150
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,646  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:484 Y2:524
All right!

151
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:52,564  X1:130 X2:582 Y1:446 Y2:524
<i>I can 't wait to be with you. </i>
<i>I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry. </i>

152
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,531  X1:103 X2:614 Y1:484 Y2:524
<i>Laundry? Is that my new nickname? </i>

153
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,572  X1:115 X2:605 Y1:484 Y2:524
<i>You know your nickname, Mr. Big... </i>

154
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:08,961  X1:087 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:524
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

155
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:21,168  X1:202 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:524
Chandler and Monica!

156
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:22,925  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, my God!

157
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:25,925  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

158
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,648  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

159
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:33,362  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:524
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

160
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:34,721  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:524
I know! I know!

161
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:36,166  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:450 Y2:524
- You know?
- Yes!

162
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:39,409  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:524
And Joey, but Ross doesn't,
so stop screaming!

163
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,322  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:524
- Hey, what's going on?
- Oh, hi!

164
00:12:43,892 --> 00:12:45,166  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:524
What? What?

165
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:48,290  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:524
We're excited that you
might get this place!

166
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:52,885  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

167
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,731  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:524
Get in here! Come on!

168
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:00,927  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:450 Y2:524
So they don't know
that Rachel knows?

169
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,925  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:524
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

170
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:08,323  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524
Enough of us know.
We can just tell them we know.

171
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:11,291  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:524
The lying and the secrets
will be over.

172
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:15,929  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:450 Y2:524
Or, we can not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

173
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:19,690  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:524
We better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

174
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:21,564  X1:311 X2:405 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Bye.
- Bye.

175
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:24,332  X1:116 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

176
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:32,165  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:446 Y2:524
Did you see
the inappropriate pinching?

177
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:33,441  X1:247 X2:467 Y1:484 Y2:524
Actually, I did.

178
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,928  X1:166 X2:550 Y1:450 Y2:524
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

179
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:40,925  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:446 Y2:524
Oh, my God!
My God, she knows about us!

180
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,448  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Phoebe knows about us!
- I didn't tell them.

181
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:47,406  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:524
Them? Who's them?

182
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:51,046  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:484 Y2:524
Phoebe and Joey.

183
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,006  X1:307 X2:407 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey!

184
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,566  X1:264 X2:450 Y1:488 Y2:524
And Rachel.

185
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:58,645  X1:119 X2:595 Y1:484 Y2:524
They made me promise not to tell.

186
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:02,128  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:446 Y2:524
They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

187
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:05,330  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
They don't know that we know
that they know.

188
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,523  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:446 Y2:524
- So... .
- Ah, yes!

189
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:11,525  X1:116 X2:598 Y1:488 Y2:524
The messers become the messees!

190
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:15,928  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:524
My God, he wants me to come
over and feel his biceps!

191
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,121  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:484 Y2:524
Are you kidding?

192
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,721  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:524
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

193
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:31,760  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:484 Y2:524
Joey? Do they know that we know?

194
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,368  X1:304 X2:412 Y1:446 Y2:524
- No.
- Joey!

195
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,132  X1:194 X2:521 Y1:450 Y2:524
- They know you know.
- I knew it!

196
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:40,088  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:524
I cannot believe those two!

197
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,728  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:524
They thought that they could
mess with us? With us?

198
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:49,442  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:524
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

199
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:52,563  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:524
Joey, you can't say anything.

200
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,603  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:488 Y2:524
Couldn't if I wanted to.

201
00:14:56,572 --> 00:14:59,325  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:484 Y2:524
She wants me to put lotion on her!

202
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:00,925  X1:248 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:524
She's bluffing!

203
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:03,930  X1:180 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
She's not backing down.
She went like this.

204
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,603  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:444 Y2:524
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

205
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:13,689  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:482 Y2:524
Aren't you guys done yet?

206
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:18,283  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:524
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over.

207
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,331  X1:273 X2:443 Y1:446 Y2:524
- I like that.
- Okay.

208
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:25,123  X1:094 X2:621 Y1:450 Y2:524
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

209
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,721  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:524
Wow! You didn't rip off
any buttons.

210
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:36,485  X1:205 X2:510 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's not my first time.

211
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,161  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524
You go seduce her until she cracks.

212
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:43,130  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
Okay, give me a second.

213
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:46,730  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

214
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:53,566  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, you're going?

215
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:55,928  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:484 Y2:524
Not without you, lover.

216
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:03,804  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:484 Y2:524
So, this is my bra.

217
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,323  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:524
It's very, very nice.

218
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,846  X1:233 X2:482 Y1:486 Y2:524
Well, come here.

219
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:16,612  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:524
I'm happy we're gonna
have all the sex.

220
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,404  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:524
You should be. I'm very bendy.

221
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:29,244  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- Not if I kiss you first.

222
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:51,490  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:524
There's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

223
00:16:52,332 --> 00:16:54,129  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:488 Y2:524
Here it comes.

224
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:56,605  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:524
Our first kiss.

225
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:08,529  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

226
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:10,410  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:444 Y2:524
- I can't have sex.
- Why not?

227
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,251  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:524
- I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

228
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:20,527  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:450 Y2:524
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

229
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:26,730  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love you, Monica.

230
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,728  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:484 Y2:524
I love you too, Chandler.

231
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:39,005  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:446 Y2:524
I thought you guys were doing it,
I didn't know you were in love.

232
00:17:40,252 --> 00:17:42,686  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:444 Y2:524
That's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

233
00:17:42,892 --> 00:17:46,726  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:524
- Well, Ross doesn't.
- We'd like it if no one told him yet.

234
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,325  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:524
No.

235
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,722  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:484 Y2:524
What are you doing?

236
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:56,131  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:484 Y2:524
Get off my sister!

237
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,563  X1:183 X2:531 Y1:446 Y2:524
Friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

238
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,370  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:524
Think it'll be different?

239
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,524  X1:168 X2:546 Y1:446 Y2:524
How can it not be?
They're gonna have kids...

240
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:09,969  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:524
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

241
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,601  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:524
And maybe they'll leave the city...

242
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:15,531  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:484 Y2:524
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

243
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,810  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:484 Y2:524
Things change.

244
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:23,084  X1:143 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:524
I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

245
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:26,045  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:482 Y2:524
It'll be okay, Joe.

246
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:30,168  X1:149 X2:567 Y1:446 Y2:524
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

247
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,768  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:482 Y2:524
Who's this little naked guy?

248
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,968  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:484 Y2:524
That naked guy would be me.

249
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,130  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:484 Y2:524
Look at the little thing.

250
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,725  X1:315 X2:400 Y1:488 Y2:524
Yes.

251
00:18:40,932 --> 00:18:45,050  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

252
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:49,001  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

253
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,328  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:482 Y2:524
Oh, that's Nana right there.

254
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:53,927  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Wow.
- Let's see.

255
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,692  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:482 Y2:524
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's. "

256
00:18:56,892 --> 00:19:00,282  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:524
Monica, you look like your grandma.
How old was she?

257
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:02,325  X1:236 X2:479 Y1:486 Y2:524
Let's see, 1939.

258
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,523  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:486 Y2:524
Yeah, 24, 25.

259
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:07,530  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:484 Y2:524
Looks like a fun gang.

260
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:16,329  X1:214 X2:501 Y1:446 Y2:524
Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

261
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,290  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:524
Let me see.

262
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,729  X1:158 X2:557 Y1:484 Y2:524
No, that would be me again.

263
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:29,771  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:446 Y2:524
- Hey, you guys.
- What's going on?

264
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:32,327  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:484 Y2:524
Well, we were just talking about...

265
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:35,649  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:446 Y2:524
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

266
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:39,731  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:446 Y2:524
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

267
00:19:40,932 --> 00:19:42,285  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:524
That's so sweet.

268
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:47,207  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
- So, we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

269
00:19:47,412 --> 00:19:50,927  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:524
As long as I don't hear his
and he doesn't hear mine.

270
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,523  X1:213 X2:503 Y1:486 Y2:524
Oh, that's beautiful.

271
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:04,245  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:484 Y2:524
Funny one! Good!

272
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,805  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:484 Y2:524
Will you marry me?

273
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:12,364  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:524
What? I don't get it.

274
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:14,330  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:484 Y2:524
Oh, yeah!

275
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:19,406  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:450 Y2:524
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

276
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:23,126  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:524
Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.

277
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,723  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:052 Y2:093
Okay, what do you think?

278
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:38,324  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:052 Y2:126
- Dude... .
- I have never known love like this.

279
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,566  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:052 Y2:126
- You really like it?
- Dude!

280
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,650  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:052 Y2:093
How did you write this?

281
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:47,320  X1:190 X2:524 Y1:052 Y2:132
I stole Monica's
and changed the name.

282
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:52,923  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:052 Y2:131
- You can't do that!
- Lf he goes first he can!

1
00:00:03,132 --> 00:00:04,326  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:06,961  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
I saw the Porsche parked out front.

3
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:10,528  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can I get the keys?
I'll take that bad boy for a spin.

4
00:00:10,772 --> 00:00:15,368  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
Ross drives it? When I ask, you say
you're the only one allowed to.

5
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:18,882  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
He's my brother, plus he drives
so slow he couldn't hurt it.

6
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:21,652  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.

7
00:00:22,252 --> 00:00:26,131  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just replace the bulbs in the
brake lights after you're done.

8
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:29,247  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Hey.
- Hi.

9
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:33,730  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
When can I take it out again?

10
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:41,249  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:450 Y2:523
- You let Joey drive it?
- I've never driven it. Not once.

11
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:44,245  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:523
Okay, once. Okay, I drive it
all the time.

12
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:50,491  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:444 Y2:523
So much for the "you-can-drive-it
but-don't-tell-Rachel" plan.

13
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:53,528  X1:105 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.

14
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:58,408  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can fix this. Monica, Rachel thinks
all you talk about is the wedding.

15
00:01:00,652 --> 00:01:05,009  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
I won't let you drive the Porsche
because you're a terrible driver.

16
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:07,726  X1:082 X2:632 Y1:482 Y2:523
There. That wasn't about the wedding.

17
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:13,928  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you want a ride in the Porsche,
I'll take you around the block.

18
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:15,565  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:482 Y2:523
You got a couple hours?

19
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:19,322  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:486 Y2:523
The One With Chandler's Dad

00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:57,440  X1:154 X2:561 Y1:054 Y2:091
Whew, that was a brisk ride.

22
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:02,640  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:054 Y2:132
- Take the top down, did you?
- Only way to fly.

23
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:07,563  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:054 Y2:128
Give me the keys. Monica's wrong.
I'm an excellent driver.

24
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:11,651  X1:151 X2:563 Y1:054 Y2:133
You're fast and irresponsible.
That adds up to a bad driver.

25
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:15,282  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:054 Y2:127
In high school, that added up
to head cheerleader.

26
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:21,208  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:054 Y2:094
Did you see how she looked at me?

27
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,370  X1:148 X2:568 Y1:054 Y2:133
She must've seen me cruising
in the bad boy.

28
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,645  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:054 Y2:128
- She's checking out your beehive.
- What?

29
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:31,723  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:054 Y2:132
- Give me a brush.
- The keys.

30
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,445  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:448 Y2:523
- No way!
- Well, no brush.

31
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:35,483  X1:189 X2:527 Y1:054 Y2:090
Fine. It doesn't matter.

32
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:40,248  X1:100 X2:614 Y1:054 Y2:128
If I remember correctly, there's
a comb on the floor of the bathroom.

33
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:56,807  X1:286 X2:428 Y1:054 Y2:094
Alimony.

34
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,043  X1:174 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
We still haven't gotten an
RSVP from your dad.

35
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:08,649  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, right. Maybe that's because I
didn't send him an invitation.

36
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:12,684  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
He's your father.
He should be at our wedding.

37
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:16,720  X1:163 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't even know him.
I haven't seen him in years.

38
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:19,321  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:450 Y2:523
And when he finds out
he wasn't asked?

39
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,807  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:486 Y2:523
We don't run in the same circles.

40
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,885  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:482 Y2:523
I hang out with you guys and he...

41
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:27,566  X1:131 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.

42
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:30,962  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think I want to trade circles.

43
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,010  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
You don't want him there.
Nobody will stare at the bride...

44
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:37,403  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
...when the groom's father's
wearing a backless dress.

45
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:42,085  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:446 Y2:523
As long as he's not wearing a
white dress and veil, I don't care.

46
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,647  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think I need to do some shopping.

47
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:53,851  X1:311 X2:404 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice.

48
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,166  X1:289 X2:427 Y1:482 Y2:523
My God!

49
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:02,531  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just washing the windshield.

50
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:10,010  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's no way I'll let you
drive this car.

51
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:11,970  X1:180 X2:533 Y1:482 Y2:523
Just hand over the keys.

52
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,008  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh!

53
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,561  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do not start this car.

54
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:22,604  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Okay, okay.
I will give you 20 bucks...

55
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,884  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
...if you get out of this car
right now. Hey!

56
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:28,528  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look.

57
00:04:28,932 --> 00:04:31,651  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you're so freaked out,
get in the car.

58
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:33,444  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
With you? Yeah, right.

59
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:34,607  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right.

60
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:36,684  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, okay, okay.

61
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:44,401  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:523
- What are you doing? Get in front.
- In the death seat?!

62
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:52,444  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, sweetie.

63
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:55,883  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Ready to go?
- My purse is at Mon's. I'll be back.

64
00:04:56,132 --> 00:04:57,884  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Wait a minute.
- What? Oh.

65
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,890  X1:207 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
That one kept going.

66
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:12,523  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, you and Phoebe, huh?

67
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:15,485  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:523
- How long have you been going out?
- A month.

68
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,041  X1:187 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:523
We ought to get to
know each other better.

69
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:21,688  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:446 Y2:523
- Sure. I'd like that.
- Yeah. So, uh... .

70
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:24,164  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's your name?

71
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,164  X1:278 X2:437 Y1:444 Y2:523
- It's Jake.
- Joey.

72
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:31,372  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Do you like the Knicks?
- Yeah, big fan.

73
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:34,888  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
Me too. There's a game Tuesday.
Do you want to go?

74
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:38,681  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
Great! Let me make sure I'm not
doing anything Tuesday.

75
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,128  X1:310 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here.

76
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:51,489  X1:090 X2:626 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What's this?
- Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas.

77
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:54,883  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
Are you serious? Eloping?
No more stupid wedding stuff.

78
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:59,131  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
No more these flowers, these flowers.
Think of the money we'll save.

79
00:05:59,332 --> 00:06:03,007  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:444 Y2:523
We're not eloping.
Can our wedding be bigger, please?

80
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:05,929  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're going to see your dad.

81
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,402  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:444 Y2:523
I want to get to know
my father-in-law.

82
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,722  X1:132 X2:582 Y1:486 Y2:523
When we went over this, I won.

83
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:13,730  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, you didn't.
Honey, just so you know... .

84
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:17,322  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
Now that you're marrying me,
you don't get to win anymore.

85
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:21,601  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:448 Y2:523
Forget it. I don't want to go.
I don't want to see him.

86
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,327  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
I know your dad embarrassed you.

87
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:27,370  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
All kids are embarrassed
by their parents.

88
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:30,331  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
You need a new word
for what I went through.

89
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,930  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
In high school,
he came to all my swim meets...

90
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,521  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:482 Y2:523
...dressed as a Hollywood starlet.

91
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:41,927  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hard enough to be 14, skinny, wearing
Speedos Mom promised I'd grow into.

92
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:47,764  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
You look up in the stands.
There's your dad cheering you on.

93
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:51,891  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:523
Dressed as Carmen Miranda, wearing
a headdress with real fruit...

94
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:55,971  X1:156 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that he'll later give to your
friends as a healthy snack.

95
00:06:56,212 --> 00:07:01,161  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:444 Y2:523
He was at every one of your swim meets
cheering you on.

96
00:07:01,412 --> 00:07:03,164  X1:175 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's a pretty great dad.

97
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:05,243  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:488 Y2:523
He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.

98
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:09,081  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Who's Mr. Garibaldi?
- Does it matter?!

99
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:16,362  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're not 14 anymore, okay? Maybe
it's time you let that stuff go.

100
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:22,327  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
If he's not at your wedding, you'll
regret it for the rest of your life.

101
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:27,451  X1:101 X2:614 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.

102
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:33,766  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I never get to win anymore?
- How much did you ever win before?

103
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:43,371  X1:104 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know how when you're wearing
pants and you lean forward...

104
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:45,682  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I check out your underwear?

105
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,689  X1:182 X2:532 Y1:486 Y2:523
Well, when Jake did it...

106
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:52,487  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:450 Y2:523
...I saw that he was wearing
women's underwear.

107
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:54,370  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
I know. They were mine.

108
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,368  X1:321 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh!

109
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:00,041  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, no, wait. That's weird.

110
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:04,287  X1:138 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
We were goofing around,
and I dared him to try them on.

111
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:05,368  X1:257 X2:458 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's weird!

112
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:09,247  X1:126 X2:589 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'm wearing his briefs right now.
- That's kind of hot.

113
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:14,847  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think so too. And that little flap?
Great for holding my lipstick.

114
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,844  X1:161 X2:554 Y1:486 Y2:523
I wouldn't know about that.

115
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,325  X1:111 X2:605 Y1:444 Y2:523
Jake says that women's underwear
is actually more comfortable.

116
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:30,325  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
He loves how silk feels
against his skin.

117
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:34,286  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
Next he'll say your high heels
are good for his posture.

118
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:38,169  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:448 Y2:523
There's nothing wrong with Jake.
He is all man.

119
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:39,970  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think more than you.

120
00:08:40,172 --> 00:08:43,881  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
He looked like a real lumberjack
in those pink lacies.

121
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:48,368  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
Only a man completely secure
in his masculinity could...

122
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:52,247  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
...walk around in women's underwear.
I don't think you could.

123
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:56,286  X1:124 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I am secure with my masculinity.
- Okay, whatever.

124
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:58,966  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
You've seen my huge stack of porn.

125
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,730  X1:093 X2:622 Y1:482 Y2:523
God, I forgot how much I love driving.

126
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:15,526  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have got to get my license renewed.

127
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:22,240  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
You don't have a valid driver's
license? Pull over right now.

128
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:25,330  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're so tense.
You just gotta relax, okay?

129
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:30,447  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:523
Okay? Just need to relax. All right?
Just need to relax.

130
00:09:30,812 --> 00:09:34,282  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
What are you...? That's not funny.
Stop horsing around.

131
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,881  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:482 Y2:523
I am not horsing around, okay?

132
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,965  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
I am "Porsche-ing" around.

133
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:45,687  X1:301 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Uh-oh.

134
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:51,641  X1:130 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:523
Stay calm. Nothing will happen.
You're not in that much trouble.

135
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,171  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really? You think so?

136
00:09:53,372 --> 00:09:56,045  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm talking to myself.
You're going down!

137
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,730  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
Has someone taken your order?

138
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:44,847  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, yeah. She did. He did. She?
I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't... .

139
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:50,484  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I just ordered a beer.
- You're straight. I get it.

140
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,322  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:523
If we called your dad,
we'd have better seats.

141
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,201  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't want him to know we're
here yet. I'm not ready.

142
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:02,046  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:448 Y2:523
He won't be too happy
to see me either.

143
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:03,162  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why not?

144
00:11:04,412 --> 00:11:07,245  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:486 Y2:523
He's kind of tried to contact me...

145
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:11,047  X1:168 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:523
...a lot the last few years.
- What?

146
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:14,403  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:448 Y2:523
Yeah. He's made phone calls,
written letters.

147
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:17,450  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
He came to New York.
I said I was too busy.

148
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:21,207  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's very "Cats in the Cradle. "
I don't want to get into it.

149
00:11:23,972 --> 00:11:25,087  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:482 Y2:523
Here we go.

150
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:28,842  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, </i>
<i>welcome the incomparable... </i>

151
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:31,247  X1:199 X2:514 Y1:488 Y2:523
<i>... Helena Handbasket. </i>

152
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:36,804  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hello, darlings.

153
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:38,451  X1:217 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:523
And there's Daddy.

154
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:49,082  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
Switch places with me. Come on!
I'll go under, you go over.

155
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,125  X1:165 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Yeah, I'll get right on that.
- Come on!

156
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:54,488  X1:123 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
What? No. Hey, Rach, come on.

157
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,327  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm sure we won't get arrested
for this.

158
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:07,487  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hi, officer.
Was I going a little too fast?

159
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,205  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

160
00:12:10,012 --> 00:12:12,924  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Can I see your license, please?
- Absolutely.

161
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:18,047  X1:113 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's weird. I had a dream last night
that I was stopped by a policeman.

162
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:19,761  X1:243 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
And then he... .

163
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:23,322  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, I probably shouldn't
tell you the rest.

164
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:28,643  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Your license.
- Yes. Here you go, Officer...

165
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,251  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:488 Y2:523
...Handsome.

166
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:34,249  X1:170 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
- It's Hanson.
- Oops, sorry. My mistake.

167
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,330  X1:276 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dear Lord!

168
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:39,603  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Wow!
- Here it comes.

169
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,689  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:482 Y2:523
This is a great picture.

170
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:47,005  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
Really? You think so? You know,
I had just rolled right out of bed.

171
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:48,122  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
You look phenomenal.

172
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:51,130  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
She should!
It was taken 10 years ago!

173
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:56,368  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
You know, you probably...

174
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:58,449  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:488 Y2:523
...wonder about the old date.

175
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:01,684  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yes. You're an Aquarius, huh?

176
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,567  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'll bet you're a Gemini.
- No.

177
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:06,961  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Taurus?
- No.

178
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:08,890  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Virgo?
- No.

179
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,445  X1:263 X2:454 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Sagittarius?
- Yep.

180
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:13,325  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
I knew it. I knew it!

181
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:15,927  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
You won't speed anymore, right?

182
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:17,770  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
I won't speed.

183
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:19,411  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Promise to take care of this?
- I promise.

184
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,887  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:523
Let him drive.
Does he have a license?

185
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,600  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Can he handle a stick?
- Well... .

186
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:27,246  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can handle a stick!

187
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:45,884  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
- That can't be your father.
- I've been saying that for years.

188
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,162  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Oh, my God!
- What?

189
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:51,444  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
That's Mr. Garibaldi
playing the piano.

190
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,852  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hello, and welcome to the show.

191
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:10,767  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:450 Y2:523
I see some of our regulars
in the audience.

192
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:14,129  X1:169 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
And a couple of irregulars.

193
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:19,651  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:448 Y2:523
- He's coming into the audience.
- Relax. You'll be fine.

194
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:23,244  X1:206 X2:508 Y1:450 Y2:523
Oh, much better.
You're invisible now.

195
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:26,531  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Where are you from?
- Bakersfield.

196
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,643  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'm sorry?
- Bakersfield.

197
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:31,770  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.

198
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:35,327  X1:143 X2:573 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll meet you back at the hotel.

199
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:40,851  X1:127 X2:589 Y1:444 Y2:523
Look, a standing ovation already.
So early in the show.

200
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:44,846  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:444 Y2:523
Turn around, darling.
Let me see your pretty face.

201
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:56,526  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
Can we have our drinks, please?
Waiter? ...tress?

202
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:09,524  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

203
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,161  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:488 Y2:523
Check it out.

204
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:20,763  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
How much of a man am I?

205
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:25,409  X1:145 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
Wow, nice.
Manly, and also kind of a slut.

206
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:29,808  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm beginning to see what Jake
was talking about.

207
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,128  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
The silk feels really good.

208
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:37,482  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
And things aren't as smashed down
as I thought they would be.

209
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,801  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's great.

210
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:42,641  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:523
You have so many more choices
than with men's underwear.

211
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:47,010  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:448 Y2:523
Bikini, French cut, thong.
And the fabrics: cotton, silk, lace.

212
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,682  X1:150 X2:565 Y1:444 Y2:523
You know what I've always
wondered about? Pantyhose!

213
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:54,851  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
The way they start at your toe,
then they go all the way up to...

214
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:02,044  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I should go take these off.
- I think it's important you do.

215
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,281  X1:217 X2:499 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's your name?

216
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:08,921  X1:282 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chandler.

217
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:11,601  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chandler?

218
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,962  X1:189 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
What an unusual name.

219
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:17,369  X1:168 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
You must have had terribly
fascinating parents.

220
00:16:17,572 --> 00:16:19,449  X1:219 X2:496 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, they're a hoot.

221
00:16:21,492 --> 00:16:23,164  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:523
And who is your friend?

222
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:25,170  X1:267 X2:448 Y1:486 Y2:523
I'm Monica.

223
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:29,728  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Monica. Where are you from?
- New York.

224
00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:34,847  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:446 Y2:523
I'm not very fond of New York.
Queens, I like.

225
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:38,931  X1:250 X2:464 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is this...

226
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:42,967  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
...sparkling something, honey, huh?

227
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,845  X1:107 X2:607 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, Monica and I are engaged.

228
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:49,001  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

229
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:51,691  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Congratulations.

230
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,450  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
When's the big day?

231
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,044  X1:252 X2:464 Y1:488 Y2:523
In two weeks.

232
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:00,366  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
I see.

233
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:06,443  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.

234
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:08,725  X1:238 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, you're bald.

235
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:10,448  X1:271 X2:443 Y1:486 Y2:523
Wait, wait.

236
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:16,126  X1:119 X2:596 Y1:482 Y2:523
We'd love it if you could be there.

237
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:19,401  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:482 Y2:523
Really?

238
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:23,648  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:482 Y2:523
I know it would make me happy...

239
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:26,245  X1:282 X2:434 Y1:486 Y2:523
...ma'am.

240
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:31,200  X1:098 X2:616 Y1:486 Y2:523
Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.

241
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:35,046  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm getting all misty here.

242
00:17:35,412 --> 00:17:39,246  X1:079 X2:637 Y1:444 Y2:523
You'd think I was having my legs waxed
or something.

243
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,250  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:450 Y2:523
- You okay?
- Yeah.

244
00:17:45,452 --> 00:17:47,647  X1:144 X2:570 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks for making me do this.

245
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:53,088  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
Before we go on with the show, I want
to say to the bride and groom...

246
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:56,250  X1:152 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:523
...how lucky they are to have
found each other.

247
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:59,046  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:482 Y2:523
In every life a little rain must fall.

248
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:00,480  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:523
Fortunately...

249
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,444  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:482 Y2:523
...in my life... .

250
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:20,122  X1:127 X2:588 Y1:450 Y2:523
When I was growing up, I played
the one on the far left.

251
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:33,083  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:450 Y2:523
Remind me to introduce you
to someone.

252
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:34,651  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Who?
- Fourth gear.

253
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:41,603  X1:185 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
What does he want?
I wasn't doing anything.

254
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:46,727  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly
from the 10 and 2:00 position.

255
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:52,764  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius
coming back to flirt some more.

256
00:18:55,212 --> 00:18:57,203  X1:218 X2:498 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's a different guy.

257
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:03,367  X1:079 X2:639 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Good evening, sir.
- Do you know how fast you were going?

258
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:07,121  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:448 Y2:523
No, I don't, but it couldn't
have been more than 60.

259
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:09,004  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're right. It was 37.

260
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:16,963  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're not ticketing me
for driving too slow, are you?

261
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:18,008  X1:263 X2:452 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's right.

262
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,611  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:486 Y2:523
You know, officer... .

263
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,641  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
I had the weirdest dream last night.

264
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:34,171  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God!

265
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:36,806  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
Your license, please.

266
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:41,649  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
You don't want to hear
about my dream...

267
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:42,967  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
...Officer...

268
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:44,851  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:482 Y2:523
...Pretty?

269
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:49,526  X1:280 X2:435 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's Petty.

270
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,687  X1:125 X2:590 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll be right back with your ticket.

271
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:59,084  X1:231 X2:484 Y1:450 Y2:523
- You have a son.
- I know. I know.

272
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,122  X1:252 X2:464 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Feel better?
- Yeah. Much.

273
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,481  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:488 Y2:523
Listen... .

274
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:13,845  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:444 Y2:523
Not that I'm insecure about
my manhood or anything, but...

275
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:17,885  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I need to hook up with
a woman right now.

276
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:19,527  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
I understand.

277
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:30,012  X1:117 X2:599 Y1:054 Y2:094
You look familiar. Do I know you?

278
00:20:30,252 --> 00:20:31,446  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:054 Y2:090
I don't think so.

279
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:33,961  X1:101 X2:615 Y1:054 Y2:095
Maybe it's because I'm on television.

280
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:39,721  X1:116 X2:599 Y1:054 Y2:133
- I'm an actor on <i>Days of our Lives. </i>
- Wow. Really?

281
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:42,605  X1:212 X2:503 Y1:054 Y2:132
- $4.50, please.
- Oh, let me get this.

282
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:54,331  X1:223 X2:491 Y1:054 Y2:094
These are for you.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>

1
00:00:02,813 --> 00:00:06,488  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:450 Y2:523
Do you realize this is the last time
we'll be here...

2
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,212  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:482 Y2:523
...as six single people?

3
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:11,246  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:18,169  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:448 Y2:523
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

5
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:21,763  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:523
The little woman. The wife.
The old ball and chain.

6
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:25,126  X1:139 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Old?
- The young, hot ball and chain.

7
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,762  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Much better.
- We gotta go.

8
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:30,407  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Where?
- Get the dress and lunch with mom.

9
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,730  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey, you too?

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,049  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
I just heard "lunch. "

11
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,444  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

12
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:44,768  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.

13
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:47,447  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:444 Y2:523
I need to talk to you
about something.

14
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:50,646  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What's up?
- This may be a little awkward.

15
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:55,483  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying 128 dinners tomorrow.

16
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,851  X1:235 X2:481 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, it's not that.

17
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:02,005  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

18
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,522  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:486 Y2:523
...but as Monica's older brother.

19
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:08,043  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:448 Y2:523
- But you're still my friend?
- Not for a few minutes.

20
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:12,252  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Right now, are you still my best man?
- No.

21
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,044  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do I still call you Ross?

22
00:01:18,093 --> 00:01:23,087  X1:141 X2:573 Y1:450 Y2:523
You guys are getting married,
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

23
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:26,890  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:444 Y2:523
But as her older brother,
I have to tell you this:

24
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:32,050  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
If you ever hurt my little sister...

25
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:37,687  X1:142 X2:573 Y1:444 Y2:523
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

26
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:40,044  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I will hunt you down...

27
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,844  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and kick your ass.

28
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,853  X1:216 X2:499 Y1:486 Y2:523
What? I'm serious.

29
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:58,568  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
- I hear what you're saying...

30
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,364  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and thanks for the warning.

31
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:02,841  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:523
No problem.

32
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:05,967  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are we friends again?

33
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,441  X1:306 X2:408 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

34
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:11,848  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
You won't believe what Monica's
brother just said to me!

35
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,324  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:444 Y2:523
The One With Monica
and Chandler's Wedding

36
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:50,972  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:054 Y2:094
What you doing, Mon?

37
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,047  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:054 Y2:133
I'm listing things that
could go wrong at the wedding.

38
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,371  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I can be prepared.

39
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:02,811  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:054 Y2:132
- What are they?
- "The dresses won't get picked up...

40
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:06,329  X1:125 X2:589 Y1:054 Y2:132
...veil gets lost,
and I'm missing something blue. "

41
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,529  X1:158 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm responsible for all those.

42
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,764  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:054 Y2:094
I had to go with the odds.

43
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,808  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:482 Y2:523
Remember I didn't get that part?

44
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:17,883  X1:234 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:523
The commercial?

45
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:18,929  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:482 Y2:523
That play?

46
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,532  X1:237 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:523
That other play?

47
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:22,731  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:450 Y2:523
- The movie?
- Yes!

48
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,242  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:054 Y2:132
The one about the dog
who flies planes?

49
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:28,326  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:091
No. But man, that one hurt.

50
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:32,526  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:054 Y2:132
- This is the one about WWI soldiers.
- Oh, yeah.

51
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:35,412  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:054 Y2:127
Back then we called it
"The Great War. "

52
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,525  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:054 Y2:094
It really was.

53
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:43,442  X1:137 X2:577 Y1:054 Y2:132
A guy they wanted backed out!
I start shooting today!

54
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:44,762  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Congratulations!

55
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:48,289  X1:207 X2:508 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Today's the dinner.
- I'll be done by then.

56
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:51,127  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

57
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,973  X1:226 X2:488 Y1:444 Y2:523
See you. I'm off
to fight the Nazis.

58
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:58,365  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:054 Y2:129
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWII, not WWI.

59
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,524  X1:301 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whoa.

60
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,571  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who was in WWI?

61
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:06,932  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go ahead.

62
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,933  X1:202 X2:512 Y1:448 Y2:523
You're gonna be late!
Go! Go!

63
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:14,527  X1:171 X2:545 Y1:482 Y2:523
Who did we fight in WWI?

64
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:17,202  X1:229 X2:486 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Mexico?
- Yes. Very good.

65
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,212  X1:175 X2:540 Y1:446 Y2:523
- Hey, Joey. We're ready.
- Yeah, me too.

66
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:37,409  X1:152 X2:563 Y1:482 Y2:523
Richard, we're ready for you.

67
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,123  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey Tribbiani, Richard Crosby
is playing Vincent.

68
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,006  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'm acting with you?
- Nice to meet you.

69
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:49,212  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe this. Incredible.
You just won an Oscar.

70
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:51,531  X1:265 X2:450 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I didn't.

71
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:53,726  X1:245 X2:470 Y1:482 Y2:523
I think you did.

72
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:57,766  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:486 Y2:523
I think I lost, three times.

73
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:01,523  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Cookie? Would you...?
- No.

74
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:06,047  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:444 Y2:523
We're about an hour away
from getting the scene lit.

75
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:10,332  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Can you guys run it a couple times?
- Yeah, sure.

76
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:12,325  X1:205 X2:509 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right. Let's do it.

77
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,922  X1:258 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
And... action!

78
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:20,092  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
- We have to find the platoon!
- Forget it, the platoon is gone!

79
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:27,132  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What?
- Platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

80
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:31,764  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:523
What'll we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

81
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:35,608  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

82
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:39,964  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hang on. Joey, you keep
touching your face.

83
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:41,248  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
Something wrong?

84
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:43,811  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

85
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:48,411  X1:196 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought it might be
a cool character thing.

86
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:51,326  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:486 Y2:523
He's a face toucher.

87
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,246  X1:239 X2:476 Y1:486 Y2:523
I don't think so.

88
00:05:57,533 --> 00:06:01,492  X1:140 X2:574 Y1:448 Y2:523
Let's take it back
to Richard's last lines. Action!

89
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,721  X1:107 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
No weapons, but we still have food.

90
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,651  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
Potatoes, pasta...

91
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:08,724  X1:180 X2:536 Y1:488 Y2:523
...and a few tins of tuna!

92
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,369  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, we gotta go!

93
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:16,247  X1:192 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Here's a question
you never want to ask:

94
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:20,202  X1:136 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Can my dad borrow one of your
pearl necklaces?

95
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,966  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
Did he say what kind of neckline
he's wearing?

96
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,282  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

97
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:28,122  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:444 Y2:523
I just met him once,
but I'm guessing...

98
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,368  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:482 Y2:523
...plunging?

99
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:34,044  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:523
He is more of a if-you've-got-it-
flaunt-it kind of father.

100
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,249  X1:119 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let me see if Rachel has anything.

101
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,523  X1:174 X2:540 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yes, include more people.

102
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:45,247  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you realize that tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

103
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,404  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have a date tomorrow night.

104
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:52,692  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I can't believe we made it.
- Don't sound so surprised.

105
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,332  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry, but... .

106
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,562  X1:284 X2:431 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Nothing.
- What?

107
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:01,964  X1:153 X2:562 Y1:444 Y2:523
Well, honestly?
Ever since we got engaged...

108
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,886  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I've waited for you to flip out.

109
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,567  X1:221 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honestly? Me too.

110
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,806  X1:294 X2:424 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Really?
- Yeah.

111
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:13,329  X1:196 X2:518 Y1:444 Y2:523
I think that something
will come up and I'll...

112
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,321  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:482 Y2:523
...go all Chandler.

113
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,373  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:444 Y2:523
- But nothing has.
- I'm so glad.

114
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:21,252  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thank you for staying
so calm during this.

115
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:23,609  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's made me stay calm.

116
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,804  X1:195 X2:520 Y1:486 Y2:523
I could've been worse.

117
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:28,932  X1:230 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll be right there.

118
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,803  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:523
<i>Before Saturday, you've reached</i>
<i>Monica and Chandler. </i>

119
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:43,683  X1:112 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>But if you're calling after Saturday, </i>
<i>you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing. </i>

120
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,011  X1:151 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
<i>Please leave a message for... </i>
<i>the Bings! </i>

121
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:04,811  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maureen!

122
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:09,403  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
- This is my cousin, Maureen.
- We're the Bings.

123
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:15,132  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi! You guys look so beautiful.

124
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,005  X1:222 X2:494 Y1:482 Y2:523
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!

125
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:21,804  X1:249 X2:466 Y1:486 Y2:523
Wow, Monica.

126
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,682  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:523
So you know, I had my
older-brother talk with Chandler.

127
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,207  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is that?

128
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:30,407  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:482 Y2:523
I told him that if he ever hurt you...

129
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:34,328  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:523
...I would hunt him down
and kick his ass.

130
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:40,404  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:523
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

131
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,803  X1:210 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
I would kick his ass!

132
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:47,485  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:482 Y2:523
Ross, please, my makeup!

133
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:51,923  X1:277 X2:438 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Chandler.
- Mom.

134
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:54,607  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks for wearing... something.

135
00:08:56,813 --> 00:09:01,443  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
This is so exciting! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

136
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:07,364  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just think, soon there will be
lots of little Bings.

137
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:15,329  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't believe I'm going back
to get spit on again.

138
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:19,208  X1:156 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're lucky, the people
who spit on you are famous.

139
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:23,723  X1:129 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Who spits on you?
- I don't want to talk about work.

140
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:29,052  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack Geller.

141
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,922  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Are you his mother or father?

142
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,811  X1:307 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jack!

143
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,247  X1:113 X2:601 Y1:486 Y2:523
What? I've never seen one before.

144
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,683  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:448 Y2:523
Dad, there's Ross.
Go talk to him.

145
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:44,010  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
I wasn't even able to act
like I'm okay with it.

146
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:49,089  X1:283 X2:433 Y1:486 Y2:523
Hello, all.

147
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:52,007  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hi... Dad.

148
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,690  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi, Mr. Bing.

149
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:00,085  X1:286 X2:429 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Nora.
- Charles.

150
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,532  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:448 Y2:523
- It's so great to see you both here.
- Yes.

151
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:08,288  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Although we may be seeing
too much of some people.

152
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:14,090  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:448 Y2:523
Aren't you too old
to wear a dress like that?

153
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,292  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:448 Y2:523
Don't you have too much penis
to wear a dress like that?

154
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,571  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

155
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:26,687  X1:106 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

156
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:30,289  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
You could kick anyone's ass
you want to.

157
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,693  X1:223 X2:492 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks, you guys.

158
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:38,247  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Rach, Rach?
- Yeah?

159
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:42,327  X1:097 X2:618 Y1:444 Y2:523
Talk to Chandler's dad and
keep him away from Chandler's mom.

160
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:46,691  X1:185 X2:531 Y1:448 Y2:523
- What's he look like?
- A man in a black dress.

161
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:57,322  X1:190 X2:525 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm Rachel, a friend of
Monica and Chandler's.

162
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,525  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'm Amanda.
- Oh, I get it.

163
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:03,890  X1:250 X2:466 Y1:484 Y2:523
"A man, duh! "

164
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,364  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
Could I have your attention?

165
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:15,491  X1:236 X2:480 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I'm Ross Geller.
- Dr. Ross Geller.

166
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:20,281  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
Dad, please. As I was saying...

167
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:23,093  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:486 Y2:523
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.

168
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:26,325  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:486 Y2:523
And I'm the best man.

169
00:11:27,173 --> 00:11:30,882  X1:173 X2:541 Y1:444 Y2:523
This marriage
is doubly special for me...

170
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:34,842  X1:133 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
...because not only is the groom
my best friend...

171
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:39,524  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
...but the bride is my little sister.

172
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:44,725  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
She's the greatest sister
a guy could ask for.

173
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,492  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:482 Y2:523
Please join me in raising a glass...

174
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:51,805  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:448 Y2:523
...to the couple we're
here to celebrate.

175
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:55,284  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:444 Y2:523
- To the Bings.
- To the Bings!

176
00:12:03,253 --> 00:12:05,289  X1:167 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm gonna steam my dress.

177
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:08,001  X1:162 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
Who will make sure nothing
happens to it?

178
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,892  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'll do it.
- Who wants it? Anybody?

179
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:13,683  X1:244 X2:472 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I said I'll do it.
- Nobody?

180
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,812  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
- All right, I'll do it myself.
- I'm not gonna screw it up.

181
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:21,483  X1:157 X2:557 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big help tonight.

182
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:25,169  X1:128 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Thanks for helping
my grandmother get to the hotel.

183
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:29,406  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Of course! That's what I'm here for.
- Okay. Sorry.

184
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:32,692  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:482 Y2:523
What grandmother?

185
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:40,169  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Where have you been?
- Taking my parents to the hotel.

186
00:12:40,413 --> 00:12:42,404  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Going back to work?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:46,089  X1:140 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Nice shades.
- Lf I wear these in my scenes...

188
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:48,602  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I won't get spit in my eyes.

189
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:54,487  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban
was the official sponsor of WWI.

190
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:57,926  X1:237 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Great! All right!

191
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,971  X1:234 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'll see you later.

192
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,410  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Where's Chandler?
- I think he's in Rachel's room.

193
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:06,092  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chandler?

194
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,805  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Is Monica here?
- She's steaming her dress. Why?

195
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,487  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:448 Y2:523
- I think Chandler's gone.
- What?

196
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:41,167  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
- He left that.
- "Tell Monica I'm sorry. "

197
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,684  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

198
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,282  X1:269 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's up?

199
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:49,882  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Tell Monica I'm sorry. "

200
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:53,092  X1:233 X2:481 Y1:482 Y2:523
Tell her yourself.

201
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:01,725  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
Chandler just left, though?

202
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,441  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
Maybe it's not what we think.

203
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:08,322  X1:159 X2:556 Y1:448 Y2:523
"Tell Monica I'm sorry
I drank the last of the milk. "

204
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:13,204  X1:133 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
Or maybe he was writing to tell
her that he's changed his name:

205
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,411  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:482 Y2:523
"Tell Monica, I'm Sorry. "

206
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:23,608  X1:125 X2:591 Y1:444 Y2:523
- It means he freaked out and left!
- Don't be so negative!

207
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:29,207  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
Good God, isn't it possible that
"Sorry" is sitting in there right now?

208
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:34,127  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

209
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,809  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

210
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:41,483  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

211
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,725  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:444 Y2:523
But, if you don't find him
and bring him back...

212
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:49,125  X1:155 X2:564 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

213
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,485  X1:251 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
I will find him.

214
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:58,650  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey? Can you
go through these lines with me?

215
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:01,771  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

216
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:06,170  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Just the last two pages.
- All right.

217
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,965  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
I found the picture!

218
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,971  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
Picture? What picture?

219
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:18,131  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:444 Y2:523
The picture of my wife
I found in your pack.

220
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:22,809  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Could you lower the script?
- I don't want to.

221
00:15:23,813 --> 00:15:27,886  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
I need to see your face so
I can play off your reaction.

222
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:30,046  X1:270 X2:446 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, look.

223
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:34,684  X1:091 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
I know you're great
and play all those Shakespeare guys...

224
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:37,003  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:446 Y2:523
...but you're spitting
all over me, man.

225
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:40,730  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Of course I am!
- You know you've been spitting?

226
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,123  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's what real actors do.

227
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:47,610  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

228
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:50,925  X1:114 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
And when you enunciate, you spit!

229
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:55,441  X1:181 X2:534 Y1:486 Y2:523
Wow. Didn't know that.

230
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,524  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

231
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:02,126  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:482 Y2:523
Picture? What picture?

232
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:14,128  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, I haven't seen him.

233
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,285  X1:094 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Damn.
- He's getting married tomorrow, right?

234
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,127  X1:222 X2:492 Y1:444 Y2:523
Yes. Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

235
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,525  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:523
- See you at the wedding.
- I wasn't invited.

236
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:28,330  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then we'll see you the
day after tomorrow.

237
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:32,612  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mom? Dad?

238
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,051  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
What are you doing here?

239
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:38,603  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:448 Y2:523
We thought we'd see what
the fuss is all about.

240
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:42,368  X1:102 X2:613 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I see why the girls like coming here.
- Why?

241
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:45,207  X1:112 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
The sexy blond behind the counter.

242
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:54,401  X1:142 X2:574 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Gunther?
- She just added him to her list.

243
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:58,922  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Your list?
- Of people we're allowed to sleep...

244
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:01,204  X1:193 X2:522 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know what the list is.

245
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:04,367  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:444 Y2:523
Come on, sit down.
Have a cup of joe.

246
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,969  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
Dad, I can't. I'm sorry.

247
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:11,449  X1:163 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
If you see Chandler,
tell him I'm looking for him.

248
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:15,845  X1:131 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
And if you see Rita Moreno,
let her know I'm looking for her.

249
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:22,406  X1:296 X2:418 Y1:488 Y2:523
Action!

250
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:27,411  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
I found the picture!

251
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:29,924  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:523
What picture?

252
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,925  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
A picture of my wife, in your pack!

253
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:37,133  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:482 Y2:523
You went through my personal property?

254
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,809  X1:092 X2:624 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why do you have a picture of Paulette
in your pack?

255
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,130  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:486 Y2:523
Because, Vincent, we were lovers...

256
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:51,124  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
...for two years!

257
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,927  X1:235 X2:480 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cut! Wonderful!

258
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,007  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:486 Y2:523
Great scene, huh?

259
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:01,723  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
You were awesome. In that
last speech, you soaked me.

260
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:05,251  X1:164 X2:551 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Tomorrow's call sheet.
- I'm not working tomorrow.

261
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:08,405  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You are now.
- No, you gotta get me out of it.

262
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,803  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:482 Y2:523
I have plans. Important plans!

263
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:22,448  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Still no word from Chandler.
- Oh, man.

264
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:25,924  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:444 Y2:523
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th.

265
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:29,329  X1:152 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, well there's one down.

266
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,530  X1:175 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm getting married today!

267
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:39,722  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

268
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,367  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
My day is finally here!

269
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,527  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
She might not even notice he's gone.

270
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:51,328  X1:149 X2:566 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm gonna start getting ready!

271
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:56,932  X1:108 X2:607 Y1:448 Y2:523
We can't let her start getting ready.
This is too awful!

272
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:00,125  X1:191 X2:523 Y1:444 Y2:523
She'll be in the gown,
and he won't show up.

273
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:03,126  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then she'll
have to take off the gown...

274
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,893  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:482 Y2:523
Stop it. You can't do this here.

275
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:08,886  X1:208 X2:507 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

276
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:11,488  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's just so sad.

277
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,605  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:444 Y2:523
Pull it together.
She can't see you like this.

278
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,890  X1:129 X2:587 Y1:448 Y2:523
- She'll know something's wrong.
- I know. I know.

279
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,291  X1:226 X2:489 Y1:486 Y2:523
There's no tissue.

280
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:22,888  X1:109 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
Can you grab me some toilet paper?

281
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:26,881  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

282
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:30,081  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
I found one.

283
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,482  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you.

284
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:36,490  X1:285 X2:430 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, God.

285
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,690  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I have another one?

286
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:43,046  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure.

287
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,884  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Do you need some floss?

288
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:53,088  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
I can't imagine what will happen
if he doesn't show up.

289
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,766  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:486 Y2:523
Here's a whole bunch.

290
00:19:54,973 --> 00:19:57,089  X1:117 X2:598 Y1:482 Y2:523
She'll be at the wedding waiting...

291
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,689  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and people will be whispering,
"That poor girl. "

292
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:04,124  X1:110 X2:606 Y1:448 Y2:523
Then she'll have to come back here
and live alone.

293
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,130  X1:256 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Oh, my God.
- What?

294
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:11,572  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
There was a pregnancy test in the
garbage, and it's positive.

295
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,164  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
Monica's pregnant.

296
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:18,966  X1:095 X2:620 Y1:482 Y2:523
So I guess she won't be totally alone.

298
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:28,412  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:054 Y2:130
- We've gotta tell her.
- No, we can't.

299
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:30,166  X1:211 X2:503 Y1:054 Y2:095

5
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:17,801  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:444 Y2:523
Do you think
this is why he took off?

6
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:22,125  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:444 Y2:523
She had to have just taken it.
I took out the trash last night.

7
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:24,721  X1:184 X2:530 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's turning into
the worst wedding ever.

8
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:29,244  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
The bride's pregnant, the groom's
missing and I'm holding this.

9
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:34,683  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:444 Y2:523
Phoebe, we cannot tell
anyone about this.

10
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:36,848  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay?

11
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:40,368  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:523
Do you know what kind
of birth control she uses?

12
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:41,567  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:482 Y2:523
No. Why?

13
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:45,646  X1:124 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
Just for the future.
This is hardly a commercial for it.

14
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:49,807  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:054 Y2:132
The One With Monica
and Chandler's Wedding

15
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,808  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:054 Y2:094
Anything?

16
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:10,283  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:054 Y2:127
No. I talked to Joey.
He hasn't heard from him.

17
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:13,000  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:054 Y2:095
I talked to Chandler's parents again.

18
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:15,123  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:054 Y2:127
- You said he was missing?
- No.

19
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:17,408  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:054 Y2:089
It seemed like I called to chat.

20
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:20,644  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:054 Y2:127
Pretty sure they both think
I'm interested.

21
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:23,207  X1:199 X2:516 Y1:446 Y2:523
- We've got to tell her.
- No, we can't.

22
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:25,602  X1:141 X2:574 Y1:482 Y2:523
She'll start getting ready soon.

23
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:29,930  X1:142 X2:572 Y1:054 Y2:133
Can't you stall her? I'll go
to the places I went last night.

24
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,360  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:488 Y2:523
How much time?

25
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:34,166  X1:091 X2:627 Y1:054 Y2:094
How long before she has to get ready?

26
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:35,851  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:450 Y2:523
- One hour.
- Give me two.

27
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:38,088  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
Then why do you ask?

28
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,767  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:054 Y2:132
- Wish me luck.
- I'm going with you.

29
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:43,451  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Why?

30
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:47,531  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:054 Y2:133
You're tired. You looked all night.
And clearly, you suck at this.

31
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:49,887  X1:252 X2:462 Y1:054 Y2:094
See you later.

32
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:51,770  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:054 Y2:132
Wait, do you know how
you're gonna stall her?

33
00:01:51,972 --> 00:01:55,123  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I'll figure something out.
- Okay, good luck.

34
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:00,724  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:054 Y2:133
Let's start with my makeup
and then do my hair.

35
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:04,641  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:054 Y2:132
Okay. But before you do that,
I need you to talk to me.

36
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,564  X1:260 X2:456 Y1:054 Y2:089
About what?

37
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:12,367  X1:155 X2:560 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm never gonna get married!

38
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:15,405  X1:182 X2:533 Y1:444 Y2:523
You will. The right
guy's around the corner.

39
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,768  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, are we done with that?

40
00:02:18,532 --> 00:02:20,170  X1:240 X2:475 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I'm serious.

41
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:25,400  X1:113 X2:602 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe I should just forget about it.
Become a lesbian or something.

42
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,490  X1:076 X2:639 Y1:482 Y2:523
Any woman would be lucky to have you.

43
00:02:29,972 --> 00:02:32,725  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:444 Y2:523
Maybe I'd feel better
if I slept with Joey.

44
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:35,730  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rachel? Are you okay?

45
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:43,482  X1:121 X2:594 Y1:444 Y2:523
Excuse me, Aaron? I have
a little problem with the schedule.

46
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:48,322  X1:097 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
I wasn't supposed to work today.
I have a wedding that I have to be at.

47
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:51,291  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's my best friend's,
and I'm officiating...

48
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:53,369  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:482 Y2:523
...so I really can't work past 4.

49
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:57,685  X1:118 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
You've gotta stay until the end.
We can't stop filming just for you.

50
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:00,531  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's not like it's your wedding.

51
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,643  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm having surgery.

52
00:03:03,812 --> 00:03:05,040  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

53
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:09,165  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
I made up the wedding,
because I didn't want you to worry.

54
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:11,448  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:482 Y2:523
But I'm having surgery today.

55
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:13,210  X1:199 X2:517 Y1:482 Y2:523
What kind of surgery?

56
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,128  X1:270 X2:444 Y1:482 Y2:523
Transplant.

57
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,722  X1:097 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're supposed to work on Monday.

58
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,772  X1:244 X2:471 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hair transplant.

59
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:25,043  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:482 Y2:523
But you're not bald.

60
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,487  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's not on my head.

61
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:35,488  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:444 Y2:523
There's nothing I can do.
You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.

62
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:39,964  X1:112 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
We've got one scene. It's just you
and Richard, and he's a pro.

63
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:42,163  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:486 Y2:523
You'll be fine.

64
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:43,966  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
Morning, Richard.

65
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:47,090  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
Hey, you're here! Great!
Let's go, buddy!

66
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:49,562  X1:177 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
We got a scene to shoot!

67
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:53,762  X1:197 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm wearing two belts.

68
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:58,322  X1:240 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Are you drunk?
- No.

69
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:00,250  X1:256 X2:458 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yes, you are!

70
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:01,971  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right.

71
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:07,165  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
So this is your office?

72
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,490  X1:120 X2:596 Y1:444 Y2:523
How'd you guys find me?
I knew I should've hid at the gym.

73
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:14,806  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What the hell are you doing?
- Panicking.

74
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:19,528  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:523
And using the Internet to try to prove
that I'm related to Monica.

75
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:24,131  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
- How is she?
- She doesn't know you're gone.

76
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:27,847  X1:138 X2:577 Y1:444 Y2:523
And she doesn't have to know.
Come on, we're going home.

77
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,327  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:444 Y2:523
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

78
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:33,569  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:444 Y2:523
If I go home,
we're gonna become the Bings.

79
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:35,450  X1:211 X2:504 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't be the Bings.

80
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,091  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's wrong with it?

81
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,203  X1:143 X2:572 Y1:482 Y2:523
The Bings have bad marriages.

82
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,006  X1:191 X2:524 Y1:444 Y2:523
They yell, fight,
and use the pool boy...

83
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,527  X1:115 X2:601 Y1:482 Y2:523
...as a pawn in their sexual games.

84
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:50,082  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:444 Y2:523
Have you ever put on a black dress
and asked me up to your hotel room?

85
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:54,410  X1:095 X2:621 Y1:444 Y2:523
- No.
- Then you are neither of your parents.

86
00:04:56,012 --> 00:05:00,210  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
It's not just their marriage.
Look at yours. Look at everybody's.

87
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:03,324  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:444 Y2:523
Only Paul Newman
can make marriage work.

88
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:05,329  X1:166 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I am no Paul Newman.

89
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:10,327  X1:113 X2:603 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't race cars or make popcorn.
None of my proceeds go to charity.

90
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,331  X1:209 X2:507 Y1:486 Y2:523
But look, Chandler...

91
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:17,927  X1:128 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
...right now no one has
a lower opinion of you than I do.

92
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:21,480  X1:108 X2:608 Y1:482 Y2:523
But I totally believe you can do this.

93
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:25,806  X1:144 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:523
I want to. I love her so much,
but I'm afraid...

94
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:27,646  X1:256 X2:460 Y1:482 Y2:523
It's too huge.

95
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,803  X1:185 X2:529 Y1:482 Y2:523
You're right. It is huge.

96
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,408  X1:183 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
So let's take it
just a little bit at a time.

97
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:36,610  X1:133 X2:583 Y1:482 Y2:523
Forget getting married for a sec.

98
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:40,646  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:523
Can you just come home
and take a shower?

99
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:42,808  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's not scary, right?

100
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,480  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:482 Y2:523
Depends on what you mean by "we. "

101
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,682  X1:166 X2:548 Y1:482 Y2:523
The nights are the hardest.

102
00:05:51,932 --> 00:05:53,968  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
But then the day comes...

103
00:05:54,212 --> 00:05:58,125  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and that's every bit
as hard as the night.

104
00:05:58,332 --> 00:06:02,166  X1:118 X2:597 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Then the night comes...
- Days and nights are hard, I get it!

105
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:06,166  X1:157 X2:559 Y1:444 Y2:523
I have to start getting ready.
I'm getting married today.

106
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:09,051  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know. At dusk.

107
00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:11,846  X1:136 X2:578 Y1:486 Y2:523
That's such a hard time for me.

108
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,887  X1:134 X2:580 Y1:448 Y2:523
I'm gonna put makeup on.
We have to be there in an hour.

109
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:17,406  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Wait!
- What?

110
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,728  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let's go to lunch!

111
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:22,082  X1:218 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
I can't go to lunch!

112
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:23,970  X1:306 X2:410 Y1:482 Y2:523
Right.

113
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:28,247  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, good God, I've fallen down.

114
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:32,443  X1:229 X2:488 Y1:482 Y2:523
What's going on?

115
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:36,570  X1:193 X2:521 Y1:482 Y2:523
All right, honey, listen.

116
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:42,124  X1:147 X2:567 Y1:444 Y2:523
When I tell you what I'm
about to tell you, remember...

117
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:45,762  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:444 Y2:523
...that we're all here for you,
and we love you.

118
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,645  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay, you're really freaking me out.

119
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:52,242  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:486 Y2:523
We can't find Chandler...

120
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:55,050  X1:287 X2:428 Y1:488 Y2:523
His vest.

121
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:57,808  X1:144 X2:571 Y1:486 Y2:523
We can't find Chandler's vest.

122
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:00,606  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
How can that be?
Wait, are you serious?

123
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:03,367  X1:242 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Found the vest.

124
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:07,963  X1:126 X2:590 Y1:444 Y2:523
We'll have to keep an eye on it,
make sure we don't lose it again.

125
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:12,047  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, wow! Okay, don't
scare me like that, okay?

126
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:16,530  X1:073 X2:644 Y1:444 Y2:523
For a minute, I was like,
"Oh, my God! The worst has happened! "

127
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:32,441  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
So you two were married, huh?

128
00:07:33,892 --> 00:07:36,690  X1:103 X2:613 Y1:482 Y2:523
What happened, you just drift apart?

129
00:07:37,932 --> 00:07:40,492  X1:201 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here comes the bride.

130
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,922  X1:205 X2:511 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God, Monica!

131
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,800  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
I want to wear this every day.

132
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:50,968  X1:200 X2:514 Y1:488 Y2:523
You look so beautiful.

133
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,931  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm so happy for me.

134
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:00,724  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Hello?
- Did Chandler show up yet?

135
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:04,288  X1:100 X2:616 Y1:448 Y2:523
- We got him back. Everything's fine.
- Damn it!

136
00:08:04,492 --> 00:08:06,926  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Where are you?
- I'm still on the set.

137
00:08:07,132 --> 00:08:10,090  X1:105 X2:610 Y1:482 Y2:523
The wedding is in less than an hour.

138
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:14,888  X1:102 X2:612 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
They won't let me go until we get it.

139
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:18,528  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:448 Y2:523
Oh, my God. I'm gonna
have to find another minister.

140
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,246  X1:210 X2:506 Y1:484 Y2:523
No, I'm the minister!

141
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:25,405  X1:148 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
Put them both on the phone
and I'll marry them right now.

142
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:26,971  X1:218 X2:495 Y1:482 Y2:523
Joey, I have to go.

143
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:31,927  X1:099 X2:616 Y1:444 Y2:523
Don't hang up on me! I'll marry you
and me right now! I have the power!

144
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:37,764  X1:104 X2:611 Y1:482 Y2:523
There you go! You put on a tuxedo!

145
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,283  X1:169 X2:547 Y1:482 Y2:523
That wasn't scary, was it?

146
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:42,724  X1:322 X2:394 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

147
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:45,844  X1:183 X2:529 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm telling you,
just a little bit at a time.

148
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:48,971  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay. What's the next little bit?

149
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,123  X1:238 X2:476 Y1:482 Y2:523
Getting married.

150
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:56,042  X1:095 X2:619 Y1:444 Y2:523
You can do that too.
Just like you've done everything else.

151
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:01,122  X1:122 X2:592 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, you're right. I can do that.

152
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:05,361  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Where you going?

153
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:09,048  X1:172 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm not gonna run away.
I just want some fresh air.

154
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:11,528  X1:302 X2:414 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Okay.
- Okay.

155
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,126  X1:258 X2:458 Y1:486 Y2:523
Oh, fresh air!

156
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:27,851  X1:091 X2:625 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Cover for me.
- Maybe you overreacted. You do that.

157
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:29,764  X1:186 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
We gotta do something.

158
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:34,369  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:444 Y2:523
Joey won't make it, so I'll
look around for other weddings.

159
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:38,844  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:444 Y2:523
Don't tell them Monica's pregnant,
because they frown on that.

160
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:40,320  X1:307 X2:409 Y1:482 Y2:523
Okay.

161
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:54,963  X1:115 X2:599 Y1:450 Y2:523
Anastassakis Papasifakis Wedding.
Excellent.

162
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,643  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:482 Y2:523
Congratulations.

163
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:02,849  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:523
Hi! Oh, great hat.

164
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:07,761  X1:084 X2:631 Y1:444 Y2:523
I need you to perform another wedding.
Can you do that?

165
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,770  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:444 Y2:523
I don't know.
Are they Greek Orthodox?

166
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:12,485  X1:259 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:17,044  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
They're my friends,
Monica Stephanopolis.

168
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:21,365  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:482 Y2:523
And Chandler Acidophilus.

169
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:35,689  X1:165 X2:553 Y1:482 Y2:523
Has anyone seen Chandler?

170
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:38,770  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:523
- I thought he was with you.
- He was with me.

171
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,606  X1:090 X2:624 Y1:482 Y2:523
We're playing a game. Hide-and-seek.

172
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:44,565  X1:195 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
You can't ask us, son.
That's cheating.

173
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:52,727  X1:106 X2:608 Y1:444 Y2:523
You're right.
Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.

174
00:10:52,932 --> 00:10:56,561  X1:140 X2:575 Y1:444 Y2:523
He can't come here and see
the bride in her wedding dress.

175
00:10:56,772 --> 00:11:00,890  X1:092 X2:623 Y1:444 Y2:523
When we got married,
I saw the groom in the wedding dress.

176
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:05,043  X1:158 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:523
That was after the wedding.
It's not bad luck then.

177
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,322  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:482 Y2:523
Honey, it isn't good luck.

178
00:11:11,492 --> 00:11:14,484  X1:200 X2:516 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God! Monica.

179
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,364  X1:295 X2:420 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know!

180
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:20,648  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:448 Y2:523
- How's Chandler doing?
- Great.

181
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:24,811  X1:130 X2:586 Y1:444 Y2:523
He's doing great.
Don't you worry about Chandler.

182
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:29,368  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,847  X1:189 X2:526 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What's going on?
- Chandler's gone again.

184
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:42,291  X1:082 X2:634 Y1:444 Y2:523
Why would you play hide-and-seek with
someone you know is a flight risk?

185
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:49,482  X1:162 X2:553 Y1:444 Y2:523
Aaron, you gotta let me go.
The guy's hammered.

186
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:54,402  X1:111 X2:604 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm sorry. As long as he's here
and conscious, we're still shooting.

187
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:07,006  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:444 Y2:523
You wouldn't happen to have
a very big fork?

188
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:11,126  X1:137 X2:578 Y1:482 Y2:523
So, I just talked to the director.

189
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:14,051  X1:117 X2:597 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's it. We're done for the day.

190
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,530  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
We finished the scene?

191
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:21,201  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:444 Y2:523
- You were wonderful.
- As were you.

192
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,048  X1:228 X2:487 Y1:444 Y2:523
So I got your car.
It's right outside.

193
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:27,130  X1:151 X2:564 Y1:482 Y2:523
Thank you. You're welcome.

194
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:31,286  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
No, we gotta go. Come on.
Here we go.

195
00:12:32,732 --> 00:12:34,882  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:482 Y2:523
Is that my ass?

196
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:44,292  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:523
- There he is!
- What?

197
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:48,163  X1:145 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
You won't get away this time!

198
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:51,409  X1:126 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
Unless you want
that ass-kicking we talked about!

199
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,244  X1:308 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ross!

200
00:12:56,772 --> 00:13:00,287  X1:178 X2:537 Y1:444 Y2:523
I'm serious! You're not
walking out on my sister!

201
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,130  X1:201 X2:513 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's right. I'm not.

202
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:05,842  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Then where have you been?
- I know about Monica.

203
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,888  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:450 Y2:523
- You know?
- What?

204
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:12,243  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:523
- I heard you and Rachel talking.
- About what?

205
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:13,521  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:486 Y2:523
You don't know?

206
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:16,963  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:444 Y2:523
If somebody doesn't tell me
right now... .

207
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,890  X1:198 X2:518 Y1:482 Y2:523
What, you'll "hi-yah"?

208
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:22,604  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:482 Y2:523
Monica's pregnant.

209
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:26,124  X1:261 X2:454 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

210
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,842  X1:155 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
Oh, my God.
And you're not freaking out?

211
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:33,840  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:444 Y2:523
I was. Then I went to the
gift shop for cigarettes.

212
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:37,203  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:444 Y2:523
- Cigarettes?
- Big picture, please!

213
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,890  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:523
So I was in the gift shop,
that's when I saw this... .

214
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,730  X1:134 X2:582 Y1:444 Y2:523
And I thought anything that can
fit into this can't be scary.

215
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,648  X1:200 X2:513 Y1:450 Y2:523
You obviously
didn't see <i>Chuckie III. </i>

216
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,523  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:523
But come on, look at how cute
and small this is.

217
00:13:56,772 --> 00:14:01,323  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:444 Y2:523
So I got it to give Monica,
so she'd know I was okay.

218
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:02,885  X1:306 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dude.

219
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:06,285  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:444 Y2:523
Way to go, son.
I knew you'd find him.

220
00:14:15,252 --> 00:14:17,482  X1:136 X2:579 Y1:482 Y2:523
Our little boy is getting married.

221
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,490  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:482 Y2:523
Look at you, so handsome.

222
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,887  X1:179 X2:536 Y1:486 Y2:523
You look beautiful, Mom.

223
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:28,081  X1:159 X2:555 Y1:486 Y2:523
You look beautiful too, Dad.

224
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:33,288  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you both.

225
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,483  X1:188 X2:528 Y1:482 Y2:523
I'm so glad you're here.

226
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:43,168  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you Chandler?

227
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:45,289  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:482 Y2:523
Are you Joey?

228
00:14:50,532 --> 00:14:52,887  X1:260 X2:455 Y1:450 Y2:523
- This is nice.
- What?

229
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:57,489  X1:129 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
I've never walked down the aisle
knowing it can't end in divorce.

230
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:15,882  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:450 Y2:523
I wish your grandmother
had lived to see this.

231
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:20,290  X1:131 X2:584 Y1:444 Y2:523
- She's right there.
- Not that old crone. My mother.

232
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:25,882  X1:184 X2:531 Y1:482 Y2:523
Congratulations, darling.

233
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:28,088  X1:176 X2:539 Y1:482 Y2:523
We love you, sweetheart.

234
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,888  X1:220 X2:494 Y1:488 Y2:523
You look beautiful.

235
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:37,080  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:450 Y2:523
- Is this new?
- Not now.

236
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:43,641  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:448 Y2:523
- Who's this?
- I'm Father Karabasos.

237
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,570  X1:203 X2:512 Y1:486 Y2:523
He's Greek Orthodox.

238
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:48,081  X1:268 X2:447 Y1:482 Y2:523
As are you.

239
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,730  X1:259 X2:456 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let us begin.

240
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:54,006  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:482 Y2:523
Dearly beloved...

241
00:15:54,212 --> 00:15:56,043  X1:246 X2:469 Y1:482 Y2:523
That's my line!

242
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,160  X1:132 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can take it from here. Thanks.

243
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,886  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:444 Y2:523
Dearly beloved,
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

244
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:14,085  X1:106 X2:609 Y1:482 Y2:523
You may be confused by this now...

245
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:18,086  X1:145 X2:571 Y1:444 Y2:523
...but you won't be
Memorial Day weekend, 2002.

246
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,321  X1:170 X2:544 Y1:444 Y2:523
Let's get started before
the groom takes off again.

247
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,886  X1:147 X2:568 Y1:482 Y2:523
We are gathered here today...

248
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,481  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:482 Y2:523
...to join this man...

249
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:39,890  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:444 Y2:523
...and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

250
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:44,731  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
I've known Monica and Chandler
for a long time, and I can't...

251
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:49,443  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:444 Y2:523
...imagine two people more
perfect for each other.

252
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:56,289  X1:141 X2:576 Y1:444 Y2:523
And now, as I've left my notes
in my dressing room...

253
00:16:57,412 --> 00:17:00,882  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:523
...we shall proceed
to the vows. Monica?

254
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:05,089  X1:241 X2:474 Y1:450 Y2:523
- He took off?
- Go on. Go on.

255
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:14,086  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:482 Y2:523
Chandler, for so long...

256
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,087  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:444 Y2:523
...I wondered if I would ever
find my prince.

257
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,163  X1:252 X2:464 Y1:482 Y2:523
My soul mate.

258
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,091  X1:200 X2:515 Y1:444 Y2:523
Then three years ago,
at another wedding...

259
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:25,800  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:488 Y2:523
...I turned to a friend for comfort.

260
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:31,046  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:444 Y2:523
And instead, I found everything that
I'd been looking for my whole life.

261
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,484  X1:270 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now...

262
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:38,284  X1:238 X2:478 Y1:488 Y2:523
...here we are...

263
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,487  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
...with our future before us.

264
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:45,286  X1:098 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I only want to spend it with you.

265
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:50,485  X1:173 X2:543 Y1:482 Y2:523
My prince. My soul mate.

266
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,683  X1:278 X2:438 Y1:482 Y2:523
My friend.

267
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:57,681  X1:174 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
Unless you don't want to.

268
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:01,485  X1:292 X2:422 Y1:482 Y2:523
You go.

269
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:03,841  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chandler?

270
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:07,088  X1:239 X2:477 Y1:482 Y2:523
No, that's okay.

271
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:15,484  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:444 Y2:523
I thought this would be the most
difficult thing I ever had to do.

272
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:21,284  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:444 Y2:523
But when I saw you walking down that
aisle, I realized it's simple.

273
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,040  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

274
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:31,886  X1:097 X2:620 Y1:444 Y2:523
Any surprises that come our way, it's
okay, because I will always love you.

275
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:38,085  X1:127 X2:587 Y1:444 Y2:523
You are the person I was meant
to spend the rest of my life with.

276
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:40,482  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:486 Y2:523
You want to know if I'm sure?

277
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:46,650  X1:157 X2:558 Y1:482 Y2:523
You may now kiss the bride.

278
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:53,801  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:444 Y2:523
I guess by the powers vested in me
by the State of New York...

279
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:56,407  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:482 Y2:523
...and the Internet guys...

280
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:02,491  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:450 Y2:523
...I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

281
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,611  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?

282
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,007  X1:309 X2:406 Y1:450 Y2:523
- I do.
- I do.

283
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,725  X1:252 X2:463 Y1:482 Y2:523
Yeah, you do!

284
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:12,201  X1:302 X2:416 Y1:482 Y2:523
Rings?

285
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:14,084  X1:283 X2:432 Y1:482 Y2:523
Oh, crap.

286
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,484  X1:224 X2:491 Y1:482 Y2:523
Let's do the rings.

287
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,686  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:482 Y2:523
We good? Yeah? Good?

288
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,530  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:482 Y2:523
Once again...

289
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,162  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:482 Y2:523
...I pronounce you husband and wife.

290
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:39,482  X1:215 X2:500 Y1:482 Y2:523
Now kiss her again.

291
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:55,690  X1:275 X2:440 Y1:482 Y2:523
I love you.

292
00:19:55,932 --> 00:19:57,968  X1:160 X2:554 Y1:482 Y2:523
And I know about the baby.

293
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:00,768  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:444 Y2:523
- What baby?
- Our baby.

294
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:02,644  X1:231 X2:485 Y1:482 Y2:523
We have a baby?

295
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,481  X1:115 X2:600 Y1:482 Y2:523
Phoebe found your pregnancy test.

296
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:08,762  X1:146 X2:569 Y1:482 Y2:523
I didn't take a pregnancy test.

297
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:10,724  X1:247 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then who did?

298
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:13,886  X1:254 X2:462 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at them.

299
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:16,885  X1:133 X2:581 Y1:482 Y2:523
And they're gonna have a baby.

300
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:57,721  X1:233 X2:483 Y1:054 Y2:132

{18}{121}Listen, I don't care|what the computer says.
{126}{206}We didn't take a bag|of Meshugga Nuts.
{212}{331}And we did not watch|{y:i}Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.
{361}{476}- Were you in our room last night?|- No.
{643}{740}I was told the movie's name|wouldn't appear on the bill.
{760}{881}- Checking out of the bridal suite.|- Right, I'm no longer a bride.
{886}{1006}I'll never be a bride again.|Now I'm just someone's wife.
{1025}{1115}And I'm the happiest guy|in the world.
{1120}{1239}- We have so much to look forward to.|- Yeah, right.
{1245}{1316}- The honeymoon.|- That's not till Thursday.
{1321}{1380}- Wedding pictures.|- It takes weeks.
{1385}{1524}- Not the disposable cameras.|- I knew I married you for a reason!
{1537}{1626}I'll go get them developed,|and you can go home.
{1706}{1831}- What did you take a picture of?|- Nothing. It was something.
{1851}{1921}Ross has the cameras.|Is he checked out yet?
{1926}{2001}Are you joking?|Checkout is not till noon.
{2006}{2109}- And he has a good 11 minutes left.|- So?
{2114}{2194}He never checks out a minute|before he has to.
{2199}{2352}Once we got a late checkout, he got|so excited, it was our best sex ever.
{2358}{2446}Until he screamed out "Radisson"|at the end.
{2476}{2591}Okay, I'll get Ross, get the cameras|and get them developed.
{2621}{2692}Thirty-two, Joe. You're 32!
{2750}{2807}- Here's your bill.|- Thanks.
{2818}{2902}Champagne, strawberries...

{4228}{4314}Soaps, shampoos.|Are you really taking all this?
{4319}{4451}- Why not? It's included in the price.|- Yeah, but you don't need...
{4457}{4545}- What is this?|- Thread.
{4556}{4658}Score!|Where are the disposable cameras?
{4663}{4759}- What cameras?|- Last night I asked you to take them.
{4764}{4863}- No, you didn't.|- Yes, before we cut the cake, I said...
{4868}{5006}Yeah, you asked me for a favor. Then|my Uncle Murray gave you a check.
{5012}{5126}Then you said, "Why is it called|a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"
{5196}{5303}- Yeah, then you did that.|- So you don't have the cameras?
{5308}{5387}- No, sorry.|- They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!
{5392}{5472}They're here somewhere.|I'll help you look.
{5477}{5556}- Great.|- In three minutes.
{5977}{6061}You're gonna open the presents|without Chandler?
{6141}{6268}They're calling out to me.|This guy even crawled into my lap.
{6273}{6382}He wouldn't mind if I opened one.|What do you think it is?
{6388}{6551}A mirror that when you look into it,|you see yourself as an old woman.
{6592}{6645}A tiny salt shaker!
{6650}{6742}Oh, my God, for tiny salt!
{6747}{6827}Oh, wow! Okay, that was fun.
{6833}{6941}Okay, I'll wait for Chandler|to open up the rest.
{6968}{7106}Although, you know, this is|part of a salt-and-pepper set.
{7111}{7188}It's only half a present.|What do you think?
{7193}{7298}It's okay to open one more if|it's a set. It's probably this one.
{7303}{7351}Or this one!
{7432}{7532}- Got any morning sickness?|- The guys don't know, do they?
{7537}{7606}No. Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.
{7620}{7700}Right. Chandler still thinks|I'm pregnant.
{7705}{7800}He hasn't asked me how I feel,|or offered to carry my bags.
{7805}{7896}I feel bad for the woman|who ends up with him.
{7923}{7986}After you, of course.
{7991}{8124}You'll only be pregnant a few more|hours. I'll tell the father today.
{8129}{8201}Is it that tall guy|from the first floor?
{8207}{8295}- No!|- What? I think he's cute.
{8300}{8379}- Then you have his baby.|- I'm trying.
{8408}{8557}It's so weird. You're gonna tell|this guy today, and he has no idea.
{8562}{8677}You'll just knock on his door|and change his life forever.
{8682}{8773}You're like Ed McMahon,|except without the big check.
{8778}{8841}Or the raw sexual magnetism.
{8877}{8997}- Yeah, I guess it's pretty big news.|- Pretty big? It's huge!
{9002}{9082}God, this guy is walking|around thinking:
{9088}{9168}"I had sex with Rachel Green.|I rock!"
{9173}{9250}Then, bam! He's a father,|everything's different.
{9255}{9354}Only if he wants it to be.|I won't ask for anything.
{9359}{9432}Okay, now he's walking|around thinking:
{9438}{9508}"Do I want to be a dad?"|Then, bam!
{9513}{9624}- What was that "bam"?|- I don't know. He's hit by a bus.
{9707}{9836}Joey, what would you do if someone you|slept with told you she was pregnant?
{9985}{10041}Who called here?
{10065}{10171}Did she sound blond? Any accent?|I gotta make a call.
{10176}{10268}Should have never walked|into that Sunglass Hut!
{10273}{10351}It's not you!|You didn't get anyone pregnant.
{10356}{10471}Why would you scare me like that?|What the hell's going on?
{10508}{10581}Is somebody pregnant?
{10597}{10640}Oh, yeah! That's me.
{10683}{10769}Oh, my God, Pheebs!|You're gonna have a baby?
{10774}{10904}Yes, I am.|Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
{10916}{11001}- Wait, who's the father?|- You don't know him.
{11007}{11101}He wants nothing to do|with me or the baby.
{11176}{11299}Who is this guy? Because I'll track|him down and kick his ass!
{11316}{11386}- David Linn.|- David Linn!
{11471}{11566}- Who's David Linn?|- Some annoying guy from my gym.
{11697}{11773}- Chandler?|- Did you find the cameras?
{11778}{11894}- No. Did you?|- Yes, that's why I'm under the table.
{11917}{12020}I checked in the lost and found.|No one's turned them in.
{12025}{12142}Great. Those cameras were the only|thing that will cheer Monica up.
{12147}{12213}You just got married.|Why is she depressed?
{12218}{12363}I'm not going to ask that question.|I can't believe I screwed this up!
{12378}{12427}I'm sorry, man.
{12475}{12572}Here's a thought.|This is the same ballroom.
{12578}{12661}There's a band.|There'll be dressed-up people.
{12666}{12741}Are you suggesting|we dance our troubles away?
{12746}{12891}No, we buy more of these, throw our|tuxes on and take a few pictures.
{12896}{12960}We make sure not|to get people's faces.
{12965}{13005}Are you serious?
{13010}{13152}I'm thinking about your new bride.|Do you really want to let her down?
{13157}{13240}Marriage advice? Really?
{13281}{13342}This looks just like your wedding.
{13347}{13429}- Same flowers?|- I don't know. Monica picked them.
{13434}{13489}- The chairs?|- Those too.
{13494}{13536}- The place settings?|- Her.
{13541}{13614}- What did you do?|- I took care of the cameras.
{13619}{13666}Gift shop?
{13801}{13880}- Did you do it yet?|- Not yet.
{13885}{13974}Then what are you doing here?|Are you about to do it?
{13978}{14036}Is it Gunther?
{14070}{14174}- It's not Gunther!|- Thank God. That hair on a baby?
{14212}{14347}The father is not here. I haven't|told him, and I don't think I can now.
{14353}{14378}Why not?
{14383}{14525}I was walking and thinking, "I'm gonna|tell the father. " And then, bam!
{14546}{14591}Bus?
{14608}{14737}No, you! You freaked me out.|You kept saying how huge this is.
{14743}{14791}- But it is huge.|- I know.
{14797}{14865}But I was thinking|how huge it is for me.
{14869}{14933}I didn't think about the father.
{14938}{15052}You're thinking about it too much.|Tell him and get it over with.
{15056}{15154}It's like ripping off this Band-Aid,|quick and painless.
{15158}{15223}Oh, mother of...!
{15259}{15306}See?
{15430}{15555}- Are we opening presents?|- No. I shouldn't be opening these.
{15567}{15680}Joey, I am out of control!|You have to do me a favor.
{15684}{15816}No matter what I say,|do not let me open another present.
{15896}{15949}Give me one more.
{16023}{16117}Good, you're here. Pheebs?|Listen...
{16125}{16206}Sit down,|I got something I want to say.
{16375}{16506}It's a scary world out there,|especially for a single mom.
{16511}{16656}I always felt that you|and I have a special bond.
{16683}{16781}So, Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
{16850}{16916}Oh, my God!
{16953}{17012}Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.
{17050}{17158}- You can't marry him!|- Your day's over, it's my turn.
{17188}{17296}- Why can't she marry me?|- I can and I will.
{17314}{17417}She's not pregnant.|Rachel's the one who's pregnant.
{17422}{17481}Oh, my God!
{17487}{17551}He'd notice|when you didn't have a baby!
{17557}{17616}It's Joey!
{17723}{17830}I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?|Who's the father?
{17836}{17886}We don't know.
{17928}{18012}- I wonder if it's that dude.|- There's a dude?
{18017}{18050}Who is it?
{18054}{18211}A month ago this guy spent the night.|I didn't see who it was, but...
{18324}{18376}Was that story over?
{18467}{18523}The guy left this.
{18527}{18641}Oh, my God!|I know who the father is.
{18725}{18816}People have got|to finish their stories.
{18952}{19039}- Could you take a picture of us?|- Of course.
{19125}{19266}- Would you take one of us?|- Yeah, sure.
{19278}{19315}Click.
{19336}{19402}- It didn't click.|- I heard it.
{19408}{19490}- There was no flash.|- You won't take our picture?
{19494}{19566}Yeah, I'll take your picture.
{19600}{19741}- Your finger was covering the lens.|- Who are you, Ansel Adams? Scram!
{19828}{19937}I feel really bad about how|I freaked you out before...
{19942}{20003}...so I asked the father|to come here.
{20008}{20104}What? Wait a minute.|How do you know who it is?
{20109}{20190}I may play the fool at times...
{20195}{20326}...but I'm more than a pretty blond|with an ass that won't quit.
{20341}{20425}I believe this belongs to the father.
{20430}{20551}Oh, God. He's in there right now?
{20557}{20694}You can turn around,|or go in and rip the Band-Aid off.
{20743}{20785}- Let's rip.|- Are you sure?
{20790}{20847}- Phoebe!|- Sorry.
{20915}{20954}Hey, Rach.
{21130}{21226}Go on-stage. I'll get a picture|of you doing the speech.
{21650}{21748}Will the owner of a 1995 LeSabre|see the front desk?
{21752}{21828}Your car is about to be towed.
{21871}{21936}That's my car!
{21955}{22024}- A '95 LeSabre?|- Yes.
{22036}{22095}- A green LeSabre?|- Yes!
{22161}{22253}- I'm sorry, I meant blue.|- Yes, green-blue.
{22340}{22415}Well, go. Go move it!
{22428}{22524}Ready for the last picture?|Get ready to run.
{22663}{22741}Congratulations on your wedding.
{22884}{22924}What's this about?
{22929}{22992}Rachel has something to tell you.
{22996}{23095}And I believe that|this is your red sweater.
{23099}{23198}No, this is my red sweater.
{23253}{23301}Oh, no.
{23353}{23446}Could I get anyone a coffee?
{23452}{23536}Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
{23561}{23605}What's going on?
{23610}{23712}Nothing.|Phoebe kind of made a mistake.
{23718}{23828}But you wear that sweater a lot.|Is it some kind of dare?
{23856}{23951}I'm actually glad Phoebe called.
{24052}{24211}I was immature, but I've grown up.|I think we should get back together.
{24218}{24267}It's not the right time.
{24272}{24387}It is the right time.|I'm ready for more.
{24392}{24447}Let's give it another try.
{24473}{24536}I'm having a baby.
{24726}{24796}- You can go.|- Thank you.
{24904}{24986}I don't know how|any of these got opened!
{25006}{25100}- You opened them all?|- I know, I am a terrible person.
{25104}{25175}Chandler won't trust me ever again.
{25211}{25284}- You got my parents' gift.|- What is that?
{25289}{25362}I think it does something|to salami.
{25443}{25500}- How'd it go?|- What did Tag say?
{25505}{25582}Tag is not the father.|And Joey knows now?
{25588}{25691}I do, and I'm so happy for you.
{25748}{25833}Wow, you didn't even try|to unhook my bra.
{25890}{26024}- Will you ever tell whoever it is?|- I will, just not tonight.
{26028}{26121}No matter what he says,|you're not gonna be alone.
{26127}{26159}I'm not?
{26164}{26231}No. Listen...
{26276}{26404}It's a scary world out there,|especially for a single mom.
{26408}{26536}I've always felt like|you and I have a special bond.
{26540}{26600}- Rachel, will you marry me?|- What?
{26679}{26753}- Pheebs, give me the ring back.|- No!
{26758}{26904}Joey, you're so sweet, honey,|but I'm not looking for a husband.
{26997}{27051}I understand.
{27063}{27166}If you'll excuse me,|I'm going to go and lie down.
{27294}{27376}I can't say that didn't hurt.
{27395}{27507}- But I'll take you back, Joey.|- About that, l...
{27512}{27596}- Oh, a Salami Buddy!|- There you go!
{27622}{27661}- We're back!|- Great.
{27667}{27766}We're hanging in the kitchen.|Let's stay in the kitchen.
{27777}{27857}- It's picture time.|- You're gonna love these.
{27865}{27982}Here's a picture of Ross.|And that's me.
{27988}{28076}And that's me and Ross.
{28090}{28192}And here's our first kiss|as a married couple.
{28197}{28265}That is a great picture.
{28270}{28401}And interesting, because I found|the cameras in one of our bags.
{28461}{28522}Didn't see that coming.
{28528}{28601}Okay, this isn't our first kiss...
{28606}{28703}...but it is my first kiss|with this lady.
{28743}{28871}Which I'm sure you'll remember,|so there's no need...
{28905}{29016}- I'll take these to get developed now.|- Good idea.
{29103}{29201}You opened the presents?|We were gonna do that together.
{29207}{29292}You kissed another woman?
{29297}{29371}- Call it even?|- Okay.
{29481}{29602}- I'll put these in water.|- You stole those from that wedding?
{29609}{29653}No, the hotel lobby.
{29657}{29811}They think they can charge me for|some dirty movie and a bag of nuts!
{29881}{29936}Hey, my sweater!
{30002}{30086}I've been looking for this|for a month.
{30187}{30262}Oh, my God!
{30405}{30443}Oh, my God!
{30607}{30722}- Hey, how you doing?|- Good. Long time no see.
{30726}{30813}- Like your sweater.|- Right back at you.
{30866}{30995}- It's crazy about Rachel.|- Well, she's one crazy lady.
{31012}{31141}- So whose is it?|- I don't know, some Italian guy.
{31166}{31256}Come on, read your own label.|See you later.
{31262}{31319}He is so weird.

{40}{130}- Are you excited about our honeymoon?|- Yeah, I am.
{216}{300}Get it out of your system|while we're alone.
{306}{399}- We came to say goodbye.|- Have a great honeymoon.
{404}{447}- Thanks.|- I'll go pack.
{452}{559}I already packed.|But I couldn't find your Speedo.
{614}{707}Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.
{713}{820}I'm gonna go pack|my regular, long bathing suit.
{860}{941}Good, you're still here!|Have a good honeymoon.
{947}{991}Oh, thank you!
{997}{1099}And I wanted you guys to know|I am telling the father today.
{1204}{1241}What? What? What?
{1283}{1362}- We know it's Ross.|- How? How do you know?
{1368}{1459}It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!
{1465}{1547}I wanted Ross to know first.|But I'm relieved!
{1553}{1644}- I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!|- I know.
{1649}{1767}- Me too!|- I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.
{1784}{1901}- You'll all be aunts and uncles.|- But I'm the only one related by blood.
{1919}{2051}Now that you all know, you can give|me advice on how to tell Ross.
{2056}{2093}What'll you say?
{2098}{2201}That I'm having it. And he can be|as involved as he wants.
{2206}{2246}That sounds good.
{2251}{2369}Yeah, but how do I start?|What's the first thing that I say?
{2445}{2526}- Okay, great. Thanks.|- Hey, good luck.
{2531}{2586}Yeah, bye.
{2591}{2627}What was that about?
{2633}{2746}No harm in telling you now.|Rachel and Ross are having a baby.
{2751}{2896}What? I didn't even know!|Why didn't you tell me?
{2902}{2974}Why am I talking like this?
{2993}{3084}I didn't think|you could keep it a secret.
{3090}{3167}I'm an excellent secret-keeper.|I've kept all our secrets.
{3176}{3238}- What secrets?|- No, no, Joey.
{3243}{3359}I'm not gonna tell you because|I am an excellent secret-keeper.

{4508}{4612}It's so romantic to send people off|on their honeymoon.
{4618}{4712}You know, they're married.|Ross and Rachel are having a baby.
{4718}{4864}- Maybe you and I should do something.|- All in good time, my love.
{4891}{5005}I left my guitar in their apartment.|You can let me in, right?
{5010}{5069}They took my key to give to you.
{5074}{5194}- What? They took mine to give to you.|- Why would they take our keys?
{5199}{5309}- Maybe they don't trust us.|- They let me keep my key last time.
{5314}{5439}When you broke the ketchup bottle|and cleaned it with Monica's towels?
{5444}{5505}- I washed those.|- No, you didn't.
{5510}{5570}Yeah, that didn't sound like me.
{5586}{5688}- I really need my guitar.|- I have stuff in there too.
{5693}{5801}- What stuff?|- Monica's chicken parm. I'll fix it.
{5846}{5999}Mr. Treeger? I need to get into|Monica's apartment. It's an emergency!
{6004}{6119}Gas leak.|Oh, and bring garlic bread.
{6204}{6266}- Did Rachel find you?|- No, why?
{6272}{6394}- She was looking for you.|- I guess I'll catch up with her later.
{6414}{6549}- She really wanted to talk to you now.|- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
{6584}{6664}- Oh, no.|- What?
{6679}{6759}I think I might know|what this is about.
{6798}{6829}Really?
{6834}{6989}Yeah. We promised we weren't|gonna tell anybody this...
{6995}{7083}...but a month ago,|Rachel and I slept together.
{7102}{7147}And?
{7224}{7374}- Wow, I thought you'd be more shocked.|- Oh, sorry. And?!
{7466}{7574}Well, we said we'd just|do it that one time...
{7580}{7669}...but now I think she may|wanna start things up again.
{7674}{7757}Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
{7763}{7889}- Why? What else could it be?|- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.
{7926}{8018}I'm telling you,|that's what it is.
{8023}{8114}No wonder she was looking|at me funny at the wedding.
{8121}{8180}She didn't say anything to you?
{8185}{8258}Maybe it's something you ate.
{8263}{8374}- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.|- Yeah, I guess I should.
{8420}{8478}You know what I have to realize?
{8483}{8604}I'm not the type of guy|women can have just one night with.
{8634}{8749}They always seem to want|a little bit more.
{8774}{8834}I should remember that.
{9056}{9104}Next.
{9115}{9202}- They're kissing, let's go around.|- They're in love.
{9207}{9288}I'm in love too.|But in an orderly fashion.
{9293}{9430}- Next.|- Hi. Can you do that and walk?
{9436}{9542}Sorry, we didn't hear you.|We're on our honeymoon.
{9547}{9692}Let me see what I can do.|There are some first class seats.
{9697}{9835}They bumped them up to first class!|Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
{9840}{9899}We are on our honeymoon.
{9905}{9996}- Grab my ass.|- Next.
{10001}{10130}Sorry, I almost didn't hear you.|I'm so in love with my new husband.
{10135}{10206}- We're on our honeymoon.|- Congratulations.
{10212}{10334}Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,|and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.
{10339}{10450}We're on our honeymoon, so can you|bump us up to first class?
{10456}{10543}I'm sorry, that couple|got the last two seats.
{10548}{10686}If we'd gone around them like I said,|she'd have given us those tickets!
{10692}{10794}25J and K, any chance|those aren't together?
{10819}{10902}They took my key.|You trust me with yours.
{10907}{10978}Of course, and I'll give it back...
{10983}{11074}...when they're done|at the key shining place.
{11145}{11207}What the hell is that?
{11228}{11320}- What are you doing?|- You said there was a gas leak.
{11325}{11442}- Why don't you use your key?|- I won't find it before it explodes.
{11448}{11588}If that happens at another building|I manage, people will ask questions.
{11651}{11719}We could have done that.
{11776}{11851}They're going into|the first class lounge.
{11856}{11909}- You know what's in there?|- No.
{11915}{11976}Me neither. We have to get in!
{12015}{12104}- Just act like you belong.|- Oh, my God! Oranges!
{12152}{12274}- Nice to see you again.|- May I see your tickets, please?
{12279}{12319}Yes, of course.
{12348}{12408}I can't see the seat number.
{12413}{12505}That's all right.|I have it memorized. It's 1 A.
{12551}{12645}- This isn't first class, sorry.|- Apology accepted.
{12650}{12764}Sir, I'm afraid I'm going|to have to ask you to leave.
{12777}{12817}Fine.
{12846}{12914}Go, go, go!
{13276}{13385}I think there's something that|we really need to talk about.
{13391}{13519}I think we do.|Why don't we go inside?
{13629}{13740}- Look, I know why you're here.|- You do?
{13746}{13909}Yeah, and to save you from any|embarrassment, I should talk first.
{14166}{14304}Ross and Rachel.|Rachel and Ross.
{14331}{14424}It's been one heck of a seesaw,|hasn't it?
{14443}{14473}What?
{14490}{14639}I mean, look, that one night we had|was fun and certainly passionate.
{14644}{14764}But don't you think it's better|if we just stay friends?
{14785}{14831}Seriously, what?
{14864}{14945}Okay, okay. You know what?
{14950}{15079}If you want to,|we can do it one more time.
{15110}{15245}I'd be okay with that.|In fact, I have some time right now.
{15250}{15354}- You know what? Can I talk now?|- Oh, sure.
{15500}{15554}I'm pregnant.
{15651}{15694}Ross?
{15801}{15844}Ross?
{15859}{15930}Okay, whenever you're ready.
{16096}{16184}And you're the father, by the way.
{16465}{16570}- Can I get you some water?|- I'm good, I'm good.
{16575}{16729}Ross, there is no pressure on you.|You can be as involved as you want.
{16810}{16964}Yeah, I... I'm just, I don't know.|I don't understand...
{16999}{17059}...how this happened.
{17113}{17189}- We used a condom.|- I know.
{17194}{17315}But you know, condoms only work,|like, 97%"%" of the time.
{17326}{17374}What? What?
{17418}{17469}What?!
{17486}{17581}Well, they should put that on the box!
{17630}{17731}- They do.|- No, they don't!
{17843}{17943}Well, they should put it|in huge block letters!
{17948}{18083}- Let's just forget about the condoms.|- Well, I may as well have!
{18121}{18280}- I was really freaked out too when...|- Freaked out? I'm not freaked out.
{18286}{18395}I'm indignant as a consumer!
{18400}{18493}- You know what? Let's talk later.|- No, I wanna talk now.
{18498}{18662}In fact, I wanna talk to|the president of the condom company.
{18667}{18739}Okay, maybe I should come back...
{18756}{18824}Yeah, I'll press one!
{18906}{19043}- I looked everywhere. No gas leak.|- So now I can heat this up?
{19056}{19110}I'll get moving on that door.
{19115}{19234}Great. Could you not tell|Chandler and Monica about this?
{19240}{19322}They don't have any kids|of their own...
{19328}{19434}...and this door was|like a child to them.
{19439}{19532}I have to put in a new lock.|They'll find out anyway.
{19553}{19676}This looks like an all-day job.|I'll have to cancel my yoga class.
{19681}{19764}Could you tell Jasmine|I can't make it to yoga?
{19769}{19844}- Sure.|{y:i}- Namaste.
{19925}{20029}- What happened to the door?|- So it's noticeable?
{20036}{20120}- Is Rachel here?|- Didn't you two already talk?
{20125}{20179}Yeah, but...
{20186}{20329}You guys know Rachel and I slept|together, but there's something else.
{20370}{20403}Rachel's pregnant.
{20408}{20490}- Holy mother of God!|- I can't believe it!
{20551}{20679}- With my child.|- That is brand-new information!
{20766}{20855}- You already know, don't you?|- A little bit.
{20861}{20950}- How you doing?|- Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.
{20955}{21014}I didn't handle it well.
{21019}{21070}- What'd you say?|- Nothing.
{21076}{21189}But the complaint department|at the condom company got an earful.
{21194}{21266}Then when I turned around,|she was gone.
{21272}{21406}But in my defense, I found out|that condoms are only 97%"%" effective.
{21411}{21475}- What?|- I gotta go find her.
{21480}{21639}Hold on! Are you serious? So, like,|3%"%" of the time they don't even work?
{21666}{21753}They should put that on the box!
{21758}{21823}- Evidently, they do.|- What?!
{22036}{22126}- I can't believe we're here.|- You've gotta be kidding.
{22132}{22171}What?
{22209}{22306}As a wedding gift, we're|giving you the Honeymoon Suite.
{22311}{22394}No! You have been screwing us all day!
{22401}{22497}- Who are you?|- We're you. Just 10 seconds later!
{22536}{22630}You got first class, the lounge.|We need free stuff!
{22636}{22709}You're not the only ones|on your honeymoon!
{22736}{22840}You can have the suite.|We don't care where we stay.
{22846}{23009}We're here to celebrate our love.|We just want to be together.
{23073}{23139}We need the stuff.
{23189}{23283}Hey, it's Joey. We smell gas|from your apartment.
{23288}{23410}- Are you serious? Joey smells gas.|- What else is new?
{23415}{23530}- We'd check it, but you took our keys.|- Do something. Get in!
{23535}{23640}- How? I could break down your door.|"- Yeah", "do that."
{23646}{23744}- You won't blame us for any damage?|{y:i}- No.
{23770}{23883}- Are you doing it? I can't hear.|- Okay, I'll break it down.
{23976}{24073}He's doing it,|he's breaking down the door.
{24155}{24214}Okay, we're in.
{24293}{24412}- Rachel, are you comfortable?|- Lf I said I was, would you judge me?
{24424}{24524}The doctor'll be here in a minute|to do your sonogram.
{24596}{24714}Oh, man, I swear, if they sold|these at Pottery Barn...
{24798}{24838}We need to talk.
{24843}{24969}Right now? I kind of got an alfresco|situation going on over here.
{24974}{25069}I want to apologize|for the way I acted earlier.
{25074}{25164}- Can you stay up near my head?|- Yeah, sorry.
{25169}{25306}I went crazy. I was thinking about me,|and I should've thought of you...
{25311}{25365}- Head, Ross! Head!|- Right.
{25370}{25478}I want you to know that I'll be|there through this whole thing.
{25483}{25605}Doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes,|baby-proofing the apartment.
{25610}{25695}- We can do that after we get married.|- Married?
{25700}{25740}We should get married.
{25745}{25839}Because that's your answer|to everything?
{25867}{25935}No, it's the right thing to do.
{25940}{26074}Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.|But we are not in love, are we?
{26079}{26213}No, but still, I mean,|you can't possibly do this alone.
{26222}{26254}Excuse me?
{26259}{26373}Come on, you can't even eat alone|in a restaurant.
{26378}{26489}- What?|- How can you have a baby by yourself?
{26494}{26579}- I can too eat by myself!|- When have you ever?
{26584}{26695}When certain people leave the table|and I am not finished!
{26700}{26783}Certain others take two hours|to eat soup!
{26788}{26842}Please, you inhale your food.
{26847}{26959}I grew up with Monica. If you|didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!
{27020}{27056}Am I interrupting?
{27062}{27147}No, Dr. Long, come in.|This is Ross, the father.
{27152}{27249}But not the husband,|because she can do this alone.
{27255}{27354}Nice to meet you.|I'll get started on this.
{27395}{27524}- Why can't you admit you need me?|- I need you to stay near my head!
{27551}{27680}Okay. Everything looks good.|Here it is on the screen.
{27685}{27753}There's your uterus...
{27758}{27855}...and right here is your baby.
{27893}{27954}Oh, my God.
{27968}{28095}Wow! There it is, I see it.
{28100}{28195}Congratulations.|I'll give you two a minute.
{28201}{28251}Thank you.
{28420}{28475}Pretty amazing, huh?
{28481}{28559}I don't see it!
{28731}{28835}- What? What?|- I can't see it.
{28841}{28920}- You just said you did.|- I know, I lied.
{28926}{29022}I didn't want her to think|I was a terrible mother.
{29027}{29170}Come here. Sure you can.|Come here. Look, it's right there.
{29304}{29374}Oh, it's beautiful.
{29380}{29449}I see it now.
{29468}{29546}- Do you really?|- No, I don't see it!
{29552}{29615}Come on. All right. Okay. Okay.
{29621}{29764}You see this tiny thing|that looks like a peanut?
{29816}{29868}Sweetie, that's it.
{29873}{29994}That's it? Well, I saw that.
{30101}{30194}- Thank you.|- You're welcome.
{30261}{30384}Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.
{30431}{30524}Yeah, that's our baby.
{30759}{30835}- So how was the doctor?|- It went great.
{30840}{30931}- Good.|- Show them the picture of your uterus.
{31069}{31109}I don't see the baby.
{31114}{31224}I couldn't see it either|at first. But it's right...
{31241}{31319}Ross, I lost it again.

{95}{222}Wait. Before we go in, I just|want you to know that I love you.
{227}{295}I had a great time on our honeymoon.
{300}{385}I can't wait|to spend our life together.
{391}{468}You're sticking with|the shell necklace, huh?
{488}{538}You're back!
{575}{642}Come on in!
{711}{754}How was the honeymoon?
{759}{864}So much fun. The best part is,|we met this great couple.
{869}{978}That was the best part?|Good honeymooning, tiger.
{987}{1061}They're cool.|It was their honeymoon too.
{1067}{1114}They live here in the city.
{1119}{1197}Can we go call them?|Is it too soon to call?
{1202}{1301}We're excited. We finally|have a couple to hang out with.
{1306}{1424}A couple? Like two people?|Like one, two people?
{1435}{1511}It's different.|Greg and Jenny are married.
{1516}{1603}Greg and Jenny?|"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler."
{1608}{1708}"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."|"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."
{1732}{1805}- They're great. If you just...|- You know what?
{1810}{1892}Give us our souvenirs|and get out of here.
{1923}{2008}- We didn't get a chance to...|- You're kidding!
{2023}{2113}- We didn't get anything for anyone.|- Nice necklace.
{2149}{2214}That you can have.

{3162}{3242}- Welcome home.|- How was the honeymoon?
{3247}{3320}Great! How about you?|You're having a baby!
{3325}{3423}- Look, I have a sonogram picture.|- Good.
{3448}{3536}Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.
{3577}{3707}Now that Ross knows, how'd it happen?|When? How many times?
{3712}{3805}Monica, that's not right.|Start with where.
{3874}{3954}It happened about six weeks ago.
{3960}{4087}I got home and Ross was there.|He'd been hanging out with Joey.
{4092}{4159}You're welcome, buddy.
{4249}{4308}Yeah, thanks.
{4325}{4418}I had a lot of work,|and Ross offered to help.
{4423}{4488}We had wine, we got to talking.
{4493}{4588}Next thing you know,|Ross comes on to me.
{4619}{4683}That's a little misleading.
{4689}{4765}- What is?|- The lie you just told.
{4798}{4883}- That you came on to me?|- There's the one!
{4888}{4978}- But you did. Let's be honest.|- Yes, let's.
{5030}{5078}It's not important.
{5083}{5202}What's important is, we're having|a baby, not who came on to who.
{5207}{5258}"Whom."
{5318}{5373}That's right.
{5402}{5489}- You kissed me first.|- You were begging for it!
{5495}{5553}You were sending me signals!
{5559}{5693}I was sending signals? Anyone think|that I'd send Ross begging signals?
{5698}{5758}Please, show of hands.
{5810}{5914}It doesn't matter what people believe!|It happened.
{5920}{6048}Maybe I need to be more careful.|Am I sending these signals now?
{6054}{6163}- You know what? Just drop it.|- Show me how I begged you.
{6169}{6257}I can show you!|I have it on videotape.
{6422}{6478}It's an expression.
{6602}{6682}I can't believe|he taped them having sex.
{6687}{6786}Yeah. You gotta tell a girl|before you tape her.
{6795}{6864}Such a rookie mistake.
{6869}{6958}- Know who has a great camera?|- Greg and Jenny?
{6975}{7036}- I want to call them.|- Let's call.
{7041}{7120}Ask them if they brought|their friends souvenirs.
{7255}{7312}8th Street Deli?
{7317}{7414}Hang up. You get food poisoning|just talking to that place.
{7420}{7494}- Sorry, wrong number.|- Here you go, babe.
{7554}{7627}Hello?|It's the deli again!
{7632}{7701}All right, I'll have a sandwich.
{7706}{7778}I don't think this number's right.
{7847}{7938}- What?|- You got fake-numbered.
{7961}{8063}- What? People don't do that.|- Oh, I think we do.
{8069}{8143}- Why would they do that?|- I don't know.
{8149}{8248}You were a delight.|You asked those great questions.
{8254}{8372}And you were never funnier.|Joke, joke, joke! You were a hoot!
{8377}{8439}You still got me and Phoebe.
{8444}{8539}Excuse me, I don't want|Greg and Jenny's rejects.
{8579}{8662}Rachel won't talk to me.|She won't open the door.
{8667}{8715}I wonder why, pervert.
{8728}{8779}Okay, I am not a pervert.
{8784}{8863}That's, like, the pervert motto.
{8868}{9003}You raise your hand, put your left|hand down your pants and repeat that.
{9019}{9080}Filming Rachel was not planned.
{9085}{9163}Here's what happened.|Joey can back me up.
{9168}{9288}A month and a half ago, remember|I came to you with a problem?
{9304}{9368}The personal thing?
{9399}{9494}- What personal thing?|- About sex?
{9532}{9613}That I hadn't had sex in months?
{9619}{9689}Yeah, I knew what|you were talking about.
{9918}{10037}I'd like to talk about something|I'm uncomfortable talking about.
{10042}{10083}Sure.
{10101}{10201}How about you showering|with your mom?
{10239}{10333}I actually had a topic in mind.
{10392}{10522}I'm kind of going through|a dry spell, sex-wise.
{10527}{10594}- For, like, months?|- Five, to be...
{10600}{10647}...lying. Six.
{10658}{10712}Six months? That's rough.
{10717}{10847}It's not all bad. I'm learning to|appreciate the small things, like...
{10852}{10962}...the sound of a bird|and the color of the sky.
{10967}{11058}The sky's blue, Ross.|And I had sex yesterday.
{11105}{11173}Please help me.|I have a date tonight.
{11178}{11256}It has to go well.|I'm scared for my health.
{11278}{11377}I got something.|It's this story that I came up with.
{11382}{11473}Very romantic.|Any woman that hears it is putty.
{11478}{11516}Tell it to me.
{11521}{11639}Now, you're gonna want to have sex|with me when you hear it.
{11645}{11714}Remember, it is just the story.
{11750}{11831}I'll try to control myself.
{11889}{11987}Years ago, I was backpacking|across Western Europe...
{11992}{12122}- You were backpacking across Europe?|- Have a nice six more months.
{12127}{12258}I'm sorry. Please, please.|You were in Western Europe, and...?
{12300}{12430}I was outside Barcelona, hiking|in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.
{12489}{12598}I was at the end of this path,|and there was a lake.
{12604}{12701}Very secluded.|There were tall trees all around.
{12707}{12793}It was dead silent.|Gorgeous.
{12799}{12941}And across the lake I saw|a beautiful woman bathing herself.
{12947}{13017}But she was crying.
{13057}{13094}Why?
{13264}{13314}This is great wine.
{13320}{13375}It's from France.
{13417}{13471}In Europe.
{13477}{13538}Western Europe.
{13598}{13727}A few years ago I was backpacking|across Western Europe.
{13732}{13823}- Really?|- Wait, it gets better.
{13875}{13935}Yeah, I was in Barcelona.
{13940}{14033}I studied for a year in Barcelona.
{14076}{14175}- Anyway, so I was hiking...|- I love hiking!
{14180}{14228}Oh, that's great!
{14272}{14381}I was hiking along the foothills|of Mount Tibidaybo...
{14386}{14486}- I think it's "Tibidabo."|- Do you want to tell the story?
{14573}{14627}How'd your date go?
{14632}{14728}Great. I'm across the street|having sex right now.
{14744}{14861}- Your story sucks.|- Then you didn't tell it right.
{14868}{14947}- Show me how you did it.|- No, I don't want to.
{14952}{15080}- How long since you seen a girl naked?|- I was backpacking...
{15085}{15211}- I'm not feeling it.|- I was outside Barcelona, hiking...
{15216}{15352}- Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?|- It's been six months. I'm always hot.
{15357}{15454}You're not selling the story.|You don't believe it.
{15460}{15531}I gotta go, I got a date.|But try this.
{15537}{15600}Do what I do before an audition.
{15606}{15720}Use my camera to record yourself|and see what you're doing wrong.
{15725}{15763}I'll try that.
{15768}{15919}Now, you're all set up. Good to go.|Just hit record. Good luck.
{15925}{16078}If you ever have any problem with the|ladies, you know I'll help you out.
{16190}{16253}That means a lot to me, man.
{16698}{16829}Can I get you anything?|Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?
{16867}{16952}Ross, thank God you're here.|You have to help me.
{16957}{17024}Were you talking to yourself?
{17030}{17119}That's less embarrassing.|Yes. Yes, I was.
{17125}{17220}"When she came in",|{y:i}I totally forgot about the camera.
{17225}{17313}It kept rolling|and recorded everything.
{17352}{17430}Yeah, we're gonna need|to see that tape.
{17450}{17543}What a great idea!|That'll get Rachel to forgive me.
{17549}{17620}It's not fair to her.|Let's forget the tape.
{17629}{17678}Thank you.
{17750}{17819}- No.|- You're right.
{17860}{17952}- Joey, no.|- Loud and clear.
{18112}{18184}I don't get why|they'd give us a fake number.
{18194}{18334}If they knew what they were doing,|they didn't give you real names.
{18339}{18464}Maybe people give out fake numbers,|but not fake names.
{18470}{18563}Hi. Ken Adams.|Nice to meet you.
{18579}{18643}Regina Phalange.
{18662}{18727}- We didn't do anything wrong.|- I know.
{18773}{18858}Although you did tell|an awful lot of jokes.
{18878}{18970}You said they were funny.|Joke, joke, joke!
{18975}{19040}Joke, joke, blah-blah.
{19157}{19230}- It was your questions.|- What about them?
{19235}{19358}The sheer volume.|It was like flying with the Riddler.
{19390}{19485}- Was that another joke?|- Was that another question?
{19552}{19593}Is Ross still here?
{19599}{19708}No, but he told us what happened.|It was an honest mistake.
{19713}{19829}How would you like it if I had sex|with you and I taped it?
{19834}{19888}Oh, forget it.
{19925}{20052}There he is, the father of my child,|the porn king of the West Village.
{20072}{20130}It was an accident, okay?
{20134}{20213}I feel bad.|I swear, I didn't even watch it.
{20218}{20284}Anyway, here.
{20290}{20388}You might be more comfortable|destroying it yourself.
{20394}{20443}Thank you.
{20614}{20666}What?
{20699}{20788}- You don't want to see this, do you?|- Hell, yeah!
{20812}{20873}I am not gonna show you this.
{20879}{20974}Not the sex part.|Just the stuff leading up to it.
{20979}{21029}Forget it.
{21035}{21174}We'll think of another way to put the|"who came on to who" thing to rest.
{21180}{21250}Come on now, think!
{21269}{21371}It's Rachel's tape,|and she can do whatever she wants.
{21376}{21484}And she wants to destroy it,|so end of story.
{21490}{21581}- I want to see it.|- What?
{21586}{21638}You don't want us to see this.
{21646}{21796}You so badly don't want us to see it|that it makes me want to see it.
{21847}{21918}Are we watching the tape or not?
{21935}{22071}- It's for your sake.|- I don't believe you.
{22076}{22163}I think you don't want them|to see you begging me.
{22194}{22288}- Rachel, please?|- Oh, a little preview.
{22327}{22453}Fine. I want the record to show|that I tried to take the high road.
{22459}{22590}Because in about five minutes,|I'm gonna be saying...
{22726}{22772}Okay, here we go.
{22852}{22909}I'm so happy.
{23005}{23102}{y:i}Thank God you're here. Help me.|{y:i}Were you talking to yourself?
{23107}{23204}- There I am.|- You're gonna get pregnant.
{23220}{23261}{y:i}I screwed up so bad.
{23266}{23393}{y:i}I told Monica that I'd send|{y:i}those wedding invitations weeks ago.
{23397}{23433}{y:i}You didn 't do it?
{23438}{23565}"I put them in my desk at work",|{y:i}and forgot about them until today.
{23638}{23760}Sweetie, it's okay. Everybody made it|to the wedding. I'm fine.
{23766}{23873}- Kind of hurting my hand though.|- I know.
{23878}{24008}"I can 't believe it", "especially after"|{y:i}Monica went on and on about it.
{24014}{24119}"Here are the invitations", "Rachel."|"Be very careful", "Rachel."
{24125}{24239}{y:i}Please no drinking liquids|"around the invitations", "Rachel. "
{24460}{24553}Did you do it on our invitations?
{24609}{24688}Not on the ones we sent out.
{24703}{24823}So just the ones you gave back to us|and we had framed?
{24998}{25083}{y:i}It seems like yesterday|{y:i}they just got engaged.
{25089}{25133}{y:i}I know.
{25143}{25263}{y:i}Remember the night they got engaged?|{y:i}How you and I almost...
{25268}{25359}"Oh", "I remember how we almost."
{25364}{25441}{y:i}You think we would've|{y:i}gone through with it?
{25447}{25513}{y:i}You think we would have done it?
{25560}{25665}{y:i}I know I wanted to.|{y:i}I just wasn 't sure if you did.
{25670}{25738}"Oh", "I wanted to."
{25752}{25858}{y:i}So we both wanted to.
{25876}{25933}{y:i}Interesting.
{25998}{26143}"Anyway", "it probably worked out"|{y:i}for the best.
{26157}{26201}"Yeah", "sure."
{26206}{26371}- In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.|- In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.
{26448}{26592}{y:i}Did I ever tell you about the time|{y:i}I backpacked through Western Europe?
{26757}{26826}Get ready to see some begging.
{26843}{26935}- Oh, you came on to Ross!|- What?
{26940}{27002}Now I'm so happy.
{27024}{27106}- What?|- You used the Europe story!
{27111}{27223}That's the magic story you use|when you want to have sex!
{27245}{27374}- How do you know about that story?|- How do you know about that story?
{27380}{27461}My friend Irene heard it|from some guy.
{27476}{27530}Some guy!
{27597}{27703}No, she told me that|his name was Ken Adams.
{27727}{27766}Ken Adams!
{28025}{28114}So, people are familiar|with the Europe story?
{28123}{28259}About that, the "who came on to who"|thing really doesn't matter.
{28265}{28336}It would have happened either way.
{28341}{28463}If you hadn't initiated it,|I know I would have.
{28482}{28583}- It was an amazing night.|- It was. It was amazing.
{28644}{28719}You think it looked amazing?
{28742}{28858}I don't know.|I honestly didn't watch it.
{28864}{28904}Yeah, me neither.
{28909}{28963}Yet.
{29075}{29185}- That may be weird.|- Yeah, it would be really weird.
{29456}{29528}- Good luck.|- Good luck to you.
{29542}{29631}- Mind if I mute?|- Oh, please.
{29645}{29757}- There go the clothes.|- You are undressing awfully quickly.
{29762}{29838}Six months, Rachel. Six months.
{30033}{30141}- We look pretty good.|- I was gonna say.
{30147}{30218}- Nice tan.|- Thank you.
{30224}{30303}I'd just gone to|the beach that weekend.
{30369}{30484}- Have you been working out?|- I have been working out.
{30523}{30608}This is so much better|than I ever...
{30743}{30815}Oh, that's not pretty.
{30850}{30933}- Make it stop. Make it stop.|- Oh, no!
{31057}{31131}Hello, Greg?|This is Monica from the plane.
{31136}{31229}Listen, the number that|you gave me, 8-5-3...
{31234}{31306}Jenny's been giving out|their old number!
{31311}{31401}Jenny! That is so Jenny!
{31407}{31504}How would you like to|get together next Saturday?
{31509}{31560}Okay, how about Sunday?
{31565}{31624}Okay, the week after that?
{31630}{31672}The week after that?
{31684}{31826}You know what? We are interesting,|funny people with good questions.
{31832}{31922}And if you and your precious Jenny|can't see that...
{31927}{31968}January 15?
{31974}{32036}We'll see you then!

{75}{142}This one's rare.|This one's medium. Go!
{148}{195}Hey, Phoebe!|How was dinner?!
{200}{301}Dinner was good! Just saying hi!|Now I'm gonna go!
{313}{392}- Well, hello there.|- Hi.
{398}{460}I didn't see this on the menu.
{465}{518}This is Tim, my new sous chef.
{537}{616}- So you're Monica's boss?|- No, she's my boss.
{621}{714}- "Sous" is French for "under."|- I "sous-stand."
{720}{816}Tim, I need a caesar salad.|And could you get me the pesto?
{821}{886}- You made pesto?|- Yes, I did.
{891}{965}Would you say your pesto|is the best-o?
{970}{1075}I don't know.|I would say it's pretty good-o.
{1115}{1161}I still need the salad.
{1170}{1216}- Great necklace.|- I made it.
{1222}{1331}- You are so talented.|- Well, it's no pesto.
{1336}{1422}Let's just cut to the chase.|You're both single.
{1431}{1496}He gets off at 11.|Call her.
{1501}{1629}I'll give him your number if I could|just get a caesar salad!
{1667}{1771}I did not yell.|I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

{2757}{2876}- Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.|- You know me, sir.
{2881}{2961}How can I get|around the computer network...
{2967}{3066}...so I can access|the really good Internet porn?
{3073}{3123}You're a joker, Bing.
{3161}{3221}What's funny about that?
{3230}{3339}- Sorry I kept you waiting so long.|- Where do you wanna go?
{3345}{3392}I think you know.
{3397}{3458}- The Hard Rock Cafe?|- Yeah.
{3468}{3536}- Again?|- Yeah.
{3553}{3681}- I'm telling you, I like the food.|- You like the "Purple Rain" display.
{3698}{3778}- Hey, Bob.|- Hey, Toby. Have a good night.
{3798}{3919}- Did that guy just call you Toby?|- Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
{3938}{4042}- Why don't you correct him?|- It's been way too long now.
{4048}{4126}The first time, I didn't say anything.
{4132}{4214}The next time he said,|"Toby, want a doughnut?"
{4220}{4286}And I wanted the doughnut.
{4302}{4397}Five years later, the doughnut's gone|and I'm still Toby.
{4403}{4502}- Chandler, you have to tell him.|- That would be so awkward.
{4508}{4586}We don't work together.|He's on the sixth floor.
{4591}{4661}So he calls me Toby once in a while.
{4667}{4731}It's not like he's calling me Muriel.
{4737}{4850}Muriel.|Why would he call you Muriel?
{4932}{4991}Oh, my God.
{5007}{5091}Chandler "M." Bing.
{5123}{5236}It's not just an "M."|Your middle name is Muriel!
{5241}{5306}It is a family name.
{5311}{5402}Chandler Muriel Bing.
{5408}{5516}Your parents never even|gave you a chance, did they?
{5543}{5648}Drake, I've discovered the reason|for your memory loss.
{5653}{5724}Your brain transplant|wasn't successful.
{5730}{5798}Your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.
{5803}{5855}Is it serious?
{5861}{5951}Not if we extract tissue|from the original body...
{5956}{6067}...and synthesize antibodies|to stop you from rejecting the brain.
{6073}{6159}That sounds simple enough.|Let's just do that.
{6164}{6256}We would, but when we went|to exhume Jessica's body...
{6261}{6316}...it was gone.
{6382}{6452}Cut.|Very nice, people.
{6458}{6509}I'll change and we can go.
{6514}{6623}- What happened to Jessica's body?|- You'll have to see it on TV.
{6628}{6701}- You don't know, do you?|- Couldn't care less.
{6715}{6801}- Good scene, man.|- You too.
{6865}{6931}What? You weren't in it.
{6970}{7055}Kash, this is my friend Rachel.|Rachel, Kash.
{7060}{7153}- Hi.|- Why haven't I seen you here before?
{7158}{7301}Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.|He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.
{7307}{7361}Which I'm not.|I'm not.
{7371}{7494}Although, I do know your favorite|ice cream flavor is butter pecan.
{7516}{7606}And your dog's name is Wally.
{7613}{7691}- Look, I'm just stroking your arm.|- Let's go!
{7697}{7768}Bye, Kash.|Say hi to Wally.
{7881}{7922}- Monica.|- Hi.
{7928}{8047}I had the best time|with Tim last night. He is so sweet.
{8053}{8116}I can't wait|to get "sous-neath" him.
{8163}{8211}- I have to fire him.|- Why?
{8217}{8297}He's terrible.|He's slow. He burns things.
{8303}{8367}He lit my pastry chef on fire.
{8378}{8451}He was nervous.|You can be intimidating.
{8456}{8548}And your pastry chef can stand|to be taken down a peg.
{8553}{8642}Well, now she has no eyebrows.|Mission accomplished.
{8648}{8726}But Monica, he loves his job so much.
{8731}{8821}Can't you just give him|another chance, please?
{8856}{8961}All right. But if he lights|someone else on fire, he's gone.
{8967}{9042}That's fair. Thank you so much.
{9048}{9118}Looks like he got you|a little bit too.
{9133}{9196}I paid to have this done.
{9252}{9301}Love it!
{9373}{9471}Hey. You know,|Kash really liked you.
{9477}{9527}He thought you were charming.
{9533}{9629}- I thought I was an idiot.|- I'm with you.
{9655}{9786}- He asked if you'd go out with him.|- I think I'm gonna throw up a little.
{9791}{9842}- What did you say?|- "No."
{9848}{9891}What?
{9896}{10021}I figured since you're pregnant,|you're not gonna be seeing people.
{10047}{10156}First of all, Kash Ford?|Not people.
{10161}{10223}Did you tell him I was pregnant?
{10228}{10367}No. I didn't know if you told people.|This was when Kash was still "people."
{10372}{10463}- Good. Just have him call me.|- I don't think that's...
{10468}{10581}Go do it or I'll come back|to that set. I'll meet more actors.
{10633}{10711}- Hey, Bob.|- How's my pal Toby doing today?
{10716}{10786}If I see him, I'll ask.
{10856}{10944}Was that Bob from six|you were just talking to?
{10950}{10991}- Yeah.|- You know him?
{10997}{11055}We're on a semi-first-name basis.
{11068}{11176}- What about adding him to our team?|- Bob?
{11182}{11324}Working here with us? Every day?|I don't know if he has what it takes.
{11330}{11421}- They love him down on six.|- But this is 11.
{11427}{11502}It's almost twice as hard up here.
{11507}{11601}- Okay, Bob will stay put.|- I think it's best, sir.
{11607}{11776}We do need to find somebody. I've got|a stack of documents this high.
{11781}{11887}Just toss them in the shredder|and claim you never got them.
{11913}{11963}That's a good one, Bing.
{11975}{12085}What does a guy have to do|to be taken seriously around here?
{12201}{12291}I gave him another chance,|but Tim has got to go.
{12296}{12381}I called the chef|who recommended him to me.
{12386}{12466}He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"
{12472}{12538}- But don't fire him today.|- Why?
{12543}{12637}- Because I'm dumping him today.|- You said he was sweet.
{12642}{12734}He's too sweet.|He calls me all the time.
{12740}{12825}"Did you get home okay?"|"Was your shower okay?"
{12831}{12927}- Don't pick up the phone.|- Then he comes over!
{12933}{12981}"I was worried."|Be a man!
{12997}{13043}So I can't fire him?
{13048}{13126}And dump him the same day?|He'll kill himself.
{13131}{13287}- Go out with him for another week.|- Are you kidding? I'll kill myself.
{13292}{13371}Then he'll just have to deal with it.
{13388}{13526}Okay. But who's gonna go first?|Whoever goes second is the bitch.
{13532}{13607}- What?|- Fire a guy that's just been dumped?
{13613}{13699}Bitch!|And dump a guy that's just been fired?
{13705}{13750}Blond bitch!
{13755}{13862}I wanted to do this days ago,|so I think I should go first.
{13868}{13924}All right, that makes sense.
{13956}{14026}But screw you! I'm going first!
{14136}{14187}Toby, you got a sec?
{14193}{14311}I wanted to get transferred up here,|but it's not gonna happen.
{14317}{14421}Apparently somebody thinks|I'm not "11 th-floor material."
{14433}{14526}Say, who the hell is this Chandler?
{14574}{14669}What's the best excuse for why|I'm not drinking?
{14675}{14746}"I'm a recovering alcoholic,"|"I'm a Mormon"...
{14752}{14856}...or "I got so hammered last night|I'm still a little drunk"?
{14896}{14959}What do you want to do tonight?
{14964}{15062}There's a powerful Ukrainian film|playing. Interested?
{15067}{15172}No. But I'll go see|a normal-person movie with you.
{15178}{15276}- Rach, you wanna come?|- I can't. I've got a date.
{15293}{15369}- A date?|- Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?
{15374}{15489}Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.|It's regular.
{15495}{15594}It's mundane.|It's actually a little dull.
{15599}{15669}It's no Ukrainian film.
{15674}{15726}Earrings!
{15743}{15881}- She's got a date? With who?|- I set her up with this actor.
{15886}{15999}- You set her up?|- No.
{16004}{16082}- What were you thinking?|- That it was okay...
{16086}{16157}...because you two haven't dated|in years.
{16163}{16291}I'm worried about my baby.|Whoever she dates, my baby dates.
{16297}{16446}- Where is this "actor" taking them?|- Hey! I'm an "actor" too.
{16470}{16563}They're taking the ferry|to a place on Staten Island.
{16568}{16716}My baby's going on a ferry? Do you|have any idea how dangerous those are?
{16721}{16820}Aren't we talking about|those big boats that go really slow?
{16825}{16967}Why not just jump out of an airplane|or burn each other with matches?
{17062}{17151}- Hey, Joey.|- Hey, Kash. Ross, this is Kash.
{17157}{17237}Hey, I hear you're going|on a ferry tonight.
{17243}{17299}Bit of a daredevil, are we?
{17334}{17422}Do you guys think this is too slutty?|Hi, Kash.
{17427}{17541}- Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?|- Yeah. See you guys later.
{17547}{17661}Have a great time, you guys.|And yes, it is too slutty!
{17923}{18022}I'm glad you called.|I feel like I'm always calling you.
{18028}{18099}What's up?|Is everything okay with Phoebe?
{18131}{18212}It will be in a minute.
{18218}{18331}- Tim, you're a really great guy.|- That's because I'm with you.
{18416}{18515}It's just, I'm in a place in my life|right now where...
{18538}{18616}So sorry. "This just in."
{18645}{18708}It's the restaurant.|Monica needs me.
{18713}{18801}No, she doesn't! I know what that is.|You can stay.
{18815}{18876}I'll miss you too, Pheebs.
{18892}{18996}And I will be holding you right here.
{19186}{19281}What movie do you wanna see?|And not one I have to read.
{19286}{19336}I get that from books.
{19362}{19444}- Books?|- Okay, car magazines, cereal boxes...
{19449}{19483}...but it's enough!
{19506}{19613}Let's not see a movie.|We'll just stay here and hang.
{19618}{19771}- Just wait for Rachel to come back?|- Hey, if that's what you wanna do.
{19776}{19837}Dude, what is going on?
{19843}{19922}- I have to find out how it went.|- Why?
{19928}{20054}- He could be my baby's stepfather.|- One date and they're getting married?
{20060}{20116}He's not you!
{20153}{20212}I can't believe she's dating!
{20218}{20322}- What did you think she was gonna do?|- I don't know.
{20328}{20440}- I can't believe this is happening.|- What do you mean?
{20445}{20551}I thought when I had another kid,|it'd be different.
{20565}{20702}I love Ben. But every time|I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...
{20708}{20776}...it breaks my heart a little.
{20792}{20896}I've always had this picture|of me and my next wife in bed...
{20901}{21042}...my kid comes running in, leaps up|on the bed and we all read the paper.
{21048}{21126}Maybe fight over the science section.
{21142}{21291}- That's nice. You can still have that.|- No. Rachel's out with some guy.
{21296}{21367}My baby went with her.
{21377}{21491}If anything, that picture|keeps moving further away.
{21518}{21566}Hey, can I ask you something?
{21572}{21722}In this picture of you and your wife,|is your wife Rachel?
{21738}{21801}It used to be.
{21825}{21911}Now she doesn't really have a face.
{21926}{21995}Smokin' body, though.
{22033}{22155}Good call. But the face, Ross,|the face isn't Rachel.
{22160}{22258}No. But how much easier would it be|if it were?
{22264}{22314}That's not what she wants.
{22319}{22416}I know. And I can't force myself|to fall in love with her.
{22421}{22501}Ross, maybe you need a new picture.
{22507}{22599}It won't be what you thought.|But no matter what...
{22605}{22717}...there's gonna be|a brand-new little baby. Your baby.
{22723}{22806}Who cares what the picture looks like?
{22876}{22957}Let's you and me go out|and have some fun.
{22963}{23026}Whatever you want. Come on.
{23047}{23151}- We can catch that Ukrainian film.|- No, I said fun.
{23198}{23241}- Hey, Toby?|- Hey, Bobby.
{23250}{23316}It's Bob, actually.
{23333}{23446}You work up here. Where's|Chandler Bing's office?
{23452}{23541}Yeah, it's right...
{23575}{23637}Right there.|Let me ask you, why?
{23642}{23741}I wanna talk to that bastard,|see what his problem is.
{23793}{23859}I'm the reason you didn't get the job.
{23865}{23912}- Toby, don't.|- Bob.
{23918}{24027}Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover|for him.
{24033}{24137}Anything you say will just get me|more upset with Chandler.
{24143}{24223}That puts me|in a difficult position.
{24286}{24367}- Is everything okay?|- That depends.
{24373}{24469}- How are you and Phoebe?|- Great. Thanks for introducing us.
{24474}{24596}My pleasure. Okay, I'm afraid|I've got some bad news.
{24601}{24650}- Phoebe!|- Monica!
{24686}{24753}- You're fired!|- I'm breaking up with you!
{24763}{24806}I'm breaking up with you.
{24811}{24888}- You're fired.|- Why?
{24893}{24994}I'm sorry. I'm not ready|for a relationship right now.
{24999}{25104}I'm sorry too.|But I like things done a certain way.
{25110}{25238}- The chemistry's just not right.|- The chemistry thing for us too.
{25273}{25366}Wow. Okay.
{25398}{25546}I realize I came on a little strong.|It's because I think you're amazing.
{25585}{25701}I wanna tell you how much I appreciate|you giving me an opportunity.
{25706}{25791}You're the most talented chef|I've ever worked for.
{25805}{25851}Anyway...
{25986}{26056}- Tim, wait.|- Yeah?
{26086}{26201}I spoke too quickly. There's|a learning curve with this job.
{26206}{26270}Maybe we could try it again.
{26276}{26361}Thank you so much.|I know I can be better.
{26405}{26506}And Tim, I just want to say|good luck here.
{26678}{26731}- Hello.|- Hi.
{26748}{26793}How was the date?
{26798}{26931}I'm alone and I just bought $ 15 worth|of candy bars. What do you think?
{26936}{27042}- What happened?|- I told him I was pregnant.
{27048}{27162}- He didn't take it so well?|- Well, better than you.
{27168}{27244}- But still not what you want.|- Oh?
{27250}{27336}Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.|Then he said:
{27341}{27414}"I hear those hemorrhoids|are a bitch."
{27426}{27491}- He sounds swell.|- Doesn't he?
{27513}{27621}You want a little cheering up?|Sit down.
{27645}{27731}Guess whose middle name is Muriel?
{27818}{27931}Chandler M. Bing.|Oh, my God.
{28022}{28096}- I'm sorry about your date.|- It's all right.
{28102}{28184}I guess I'm just done|with the dating thing.
{28190}{28297}Just one more thing in my life|that's completely different.
{28303}{28396}- This is hard.|- Yeah, I know.
{28443}{28589}On the other hand, in seven months|you're gonna have something...
{28595}{28736}...that you're gonna love more than|any guy you've ever gone out with.
{28758}{28811}Just wait.
{28840}{28947}Wait until the first time|your baby grabs your finger.
{28953}{29011}You have no idea.
{29046}{29106}Thanks, sweetie.
{29198}{29337}- You wanna grab some coffee?|- No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.
{29343}{29456}- I thought I cheered you up.|- You did. There are 20 in here.
{29478}{29536}- Good night.|- Good night.
{29710}{29803}Ross? Hey, it's Mona.|From the wedding.
{29808}{29871}- Oh, hi!|- Hi.
{29906}{29997}- How are you?|- I'm good, except you owe me a dance.
{30003}{30143}That's right. Well, would you be|interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
{30175}{30241}Oh, you're serious. Sure.
{30256}{30316}Great. Well...
{30333}{30479}- I think I need another cup of coffee.|- Sure, let me get it for you.
{30875}{30905}Bob?
{30910}{30945}Bob!
{31011}{31122}- What the hell are you doing?|- This is Chandler's office.
{31128}{31201}Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!

{72}{123}- Guys, guess what?|- What?
{129}{197}We're having a Halloween party!
{204}{230}- Good!|- Great!
{237}{336}- You have to wear a costume.|- I can't make it.
{342}{383}Come on, it'll be fun.
{389}{508}I'll be there. I have to wear a|costume to my classes that day anyway.
{514}{596}Tell me you're not gonna dress|like a dinosaur.
{603}{671}Not two years in a row.
{696}{776}- I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.|- You have to.
{783}{919}No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,|pretending to be someone you're not.
{926}{992}You're an actor.
{1004}{1057}Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
{1061}{1118}- I will.|- The girl from the wedding?
{1154}{1253}If she needs costume ideas,|she could be a bikini model...
{1259}{1343}...or a slutty nurse,|or a sexy cheerleader.
{1349}{1493}Or Leatherface from "Texas Chainsaw"|"Massacre." No! Slutty Leatherface.
{1519}{1597}Wasn't Joey hitting on her too?
{1604}{1672}That's right, he was hitting on her.
{1679}{1792}And I got her. I guess|the better man won.
{1798}{1872}Please don't take her from me.

{2884}{2927}Ursula!
{2934}{2995}Wait. It's me, Phoebe.
{3001}{3081}I thought there was a mirror there.|Okay. Bye.
{3087}{3115}Wait a second!
{3122}{3171}So, what's new with you?
{3187}{3265}Nothing.|I'm getting married next week.
{3272}{3307}What?
{3314}{3390}Lt'll be a small ceremony.|Just family.
{3396}{3425}His.
{3469}{3502}Okay.
{3509}{3546}I'm happy for you.
{3559}{3670}Wait. If you want to come,|I guess that'd be okay.
{3676}{3702}- Really?|- Sure.
{3709}{3771}You could be my sister for the day.
{3778}{3852}Yeah, okay.
{3859}{3972}My friends are having a party tonight,|so you could come.
{3979}{4032}Maybe I could meet the guy.
{4038}{4108}Well, I'm supposed to work tonight.
{4114}{4202}I'm supposed to be working now,|so who cares!
{4209}{4308}- It's a costume party.|- So that's why you're...
{4329}{4362}No.
{4368}{4421}But thanks.
{4574}{4642}- You're supposed to wear a costume.|- I am.
{4649}{4756}I am a woman who spent money|on a dress she wants to wear...
{4762}{4848}...because soon she won't|fit into it.
{4854}{4957}I'm Catwoman, who wants the dress|when you're too big for it.
{4988}{5053}- Trick or treat!|- Can I give out candy?
{5059}{5176}I want to be with kids. Since I got|pregnant, I have maternal instincts.
{5182}{5252}- Trick or treat!|- Just a minute!
{5394}{5439}Look at you guys!
{5445}{5552}- Wow! You are a very scary witch.|- Thank you.
{5559}{5651}- And you are a very funny clown.|- Thank you.
{5657}{5690}And you...
{5696}{5780}...are so in style right now.
{5786}{5913}I work at Ralph Lauren. The fall line|has got this equestrian theme.
{5919}{6036}- Did you see the cover of "Vogue"...?|- Could I just have the candy?
{6100}{6141}Sure.
{6329}{6407}Catwoman. So we meet again.
{6414}{6459}So we do, Supergirl.
{6479}{6536}It's me, Phoebe.
{6583}{6657}Monica, can I talk to you|for a second?
{6795}{6844}I appreciate the costume.
{6850}{6903}You did this to him?
{6909}{6948}I thought he'd love it.
{6954}{7102}- He loves "The Velveteen Rabbit."|- That rabbit was brown and white.
{7107}{7162}It was pink, or no bunny at all.
{7168}{7261}No bunny at all.|Always no bunny at all!
{7314}{7437}- You didn't dress up either?|- Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.
{7539}{7598}Dude, what happened?
{7604}{7643}How is that me?
{7674}{7729}I'm Chandler.
{7757}{7817}That is so you!
{7824}{7931}- When have I ever done that?|- When have I ever done that?
{8018}{8067}Trick or treat.
{8168}{8261}- You're the prettiest ballerina ever.|- Thank you.
{8299}{8354}That deserves another candy.
{8359}{8406}Thank you.
{8461}{8547}I have to say,|that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.
{8552}{8613}I love you!
{8664}{8721}Honey, here, take it all.
{8841}{8890}Monica? We need more candy.
{8897}{8957}- There's only been four kids.|- I know.
{8964}{9052}But one said she loved me,|so I gave her everything.
{9059}{9104}No wonder you're pregnant.
{9249}{9399}- What are you supposed to be?|- Remember the satellite, Sputnik?
{9418}{9519}Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"...
{9529}{9597}...and these are my antenna.
{9602}{9676}So Sputnik becomes...?
{9772}{9866}Spud-nik!
{9904}{9986}Wow! I don't have|the worst costume anymore.
{10024}{10102}All right! Ross came as doodie.
{10144}{10230}- No, I'm not doodie.|- No, space-doodie.
{10458}{10482}Hey, sweetie.
{10549}{10602}- Aren't you gonna kiss me?|- Okay.
{10609}{10693}But right after, you have to tell me|who you are.
{10699}{10750}- Ursula?|- Ursula's fiance?
{10756}{10883}You're the sister. I just slapped|my future sister-in-law's ass.
{10889}{10969}Is your mother here?|I could slap her on the butt.
{10976}{11071}- My mother killed herself.|- See, and I knew that.
{11124}{11167}Now I'm sweating.
{11174}{11295}I'm sweating. Now I'm saying look|at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.
{11302}{11341}No. We'll start over.
{11347}{11415}- Hi, I'm Phoebe.|- Eric.
{11422}{11533}- Why are you looking at me like that?|- Sweat's burning my eyes.
{11539}{11572}- Thank you.|- There.
{11578}{11642}- What are you?|- There's no name for it.
{11646}{11722}I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.
{11754}{11865}- No, I meant your costume.|- I'm a solar system.
{11872}{11923}My second graders helped.
{11929}{11997}- I love the second grade.|- Really?
{12003}{12141}It's much better than first grade,|and definitely better than third.
{12147}{12231}With all the politics|and the mind games.
{12249}{12362}- So, what do you do?|- I'm a masseuse, by day.
{12393}{12473}- You don't have to stay with me.|- I'm having fun.
{12477}{12602}- I'm excited for you and Ursula.|- I feel very lucky. She's great.
{12609}{12722}- She's the most beautiful woman ever.|- Thank you.
{12854}{12903}- Hey, Joey?|- Yeah?
{12909}{13001}- You read comic books, right?|- Exclusively.
{13008}{13092}Who would win in a fight,|Catwoman or Supergirl?
{13098}{13149}- Catwoman, hands down.|- Yeah.
{13156}{13236}Between you and Phoebe?|I'd give Phoebe the edge.
{13241}{13284}- What? Really?|- You kidding?
{13291}{13423}Phoebe lived on the street, okay?|Plus, she's got a crazy temper.
{13429}{13493}She's not right behind me, is she?
{13499}{13538}- No, you're fine.|- Okay.
{13544}{13612}- Could I take Rachel?|- I'm not sure.
{13619}{13678}What? Come on, I am tough!
{13684}{13749}Punch me here, as hard as you can!
{13755}{13837}Relax. Why are you so serious?|It doesn't matter.
{13842}{13959}Really? What if I told you|Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
{13965}{14016}I would say, "Woman, please."
{14084}{14143}Ursula's fiance is really sweet.
{14150}{14213}He's a teacher,|he does volunteer work.
{14219}{14377}Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.|But I could just mop him up.
{14384}{14435}- Oh, my God, Phoebe?|- What?
{14441}{14562}- You're getting a crush on him.|- No, I'm not, you are!
{14568}{14636}Here comes the temper.
{14703}{14729}Trick or treat.
{14744}{14843}Know what? We're out of candy.|But someone went for more.
{14849}{14968}And I've been giving out money,|but I'm out of that too.
{14974}{15029}- Can I write you a check?|- Okay.
{15036}{15151}- Okay. What's your name?|- Lelani Mayolanofavich.
{15199}{15291}Okay, I'm just gonna write this out|to "cash."
{15319}{15372}- Hi.|- Hi, Mona.
{15429}{15542}Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was|hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.
{15548}{15622}Actually, I'm just a nurse.
{15644}{15751}You'd think that would embarrass me,|but I'm maxed out.
{15788}{15825}- You made it.|- Wait.
{15831}{15934}- You're a potato?|- Well, I'm a spud...?
{15940}{16043}- And the antenna... You're Spud-nik!|- Yes!
{16064}{16117}Marry her.
{16152}{16255}Here's a good one. Who'd win|a fight between Ross and Chandler?
{16268}{16319}I can't. Chandler's my husband.
{16325}{16382}- So Ross?|- Yeah.
{16394}{16468}- Hey, beautiful.|- Hello, handsome.
{16474}{16502}Oh, God.
{16549}{16625}Look at you two.|When did you guys meet?
{16629}{16672}- Two weeks ago.|- That's it?
{16692}{16782}I know. It sounds crazy,|and I'm not impulsive, but...
{16789}{16886}...we have so much in common.|- Oh, really?
{16892}{16947}We're both teachers.
{16992}{17097}- And we were both in the Peace Corps.|- Peace Corps, really?
{17134}{17282}When we were building in Uruguay,|we were two towns apart and never met.
{17287}{17411}Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got|there, but it was a town when I left.
{17439}{17509}- Shall we get me really drunk?|- Sure.
{17644}{17697}Howdy, doodie.
{17714}{17749}That's funny, yeah.
{17753}{17868}You're the funniest man here in a|bunny costume his wife made him wear.
{17889}{17981}Relax, man. You're looking|a little "flushed."
{18104}{18186}- Our question might get answered.|- What question?
{18193}{18277}Who could kick whose ass in a fight,|you or Ross?
{18294}{18376}- There's no question.|- So you think Ross too?
{18444}{18503}- You picked Ross?|- Ross is strong.
{18509}{18622}He's the strongest out of all three|of you. Except for Joey.
{18639}{18748}- I can't believe you didn't pick me.|- She's right. I am stronger.
{18754}{18807}I would destroy you.
{18814}{18927}Really? You think you're stronger?|Why don't you prove it?
{18950}{19014}I'll prove it like a theorem!
{19019}{19070}All right! Stop it!
{19097}{19152}Stop! No one's gonna fight.
{19157}{19243}People came to see a fight,|let's give them one!
{19293}{19396}- You guys could arm-wrestle.|- Listen to the slutty nurse.
{19412}{19519}- You're going down.|- Oh, yeah? You're going downtown!
{19526}{19621}Seriously, guys, the trash talk|is embarrassing.
{19806}{19882}Gunther, you brought candy.|Thank you so much.
{19886}{19956}- You are so sweet.|- Really?
{19962}{20077}You are gonna make some man|the luckiest guy in the world.
{20094}{20151}- Got to go.|- Trick or treat.
{20163}{20247}Hi! Wow! There you go.
{20269}{20366}My friend Lewis told me|you were giving out money.
{20372}{20442}We were, but now we've got candy.
{20459}{20521}I'd rather have the money.
{20555}{20619}That's not your choice.|Happy Halloween!
{20627}{20657}This isn't fair.
{20663}{20741}Is it fair that you put on a cape|and get stuff?
{20748}{20797}Shut up!
{20809}{20837}You shut up!
{20882}{20981}- You can't tell me to shut up.|- I think I just did.
{20987}{21044}And here it comes again. Shut up!
{21087}{21151}No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.
{21181}{21273}Wait, I had one more thing to say.|Right. Shut up.
{21298}{21341}You're a mean old woman.
{21347}{21390}Wait! Shut... Don't cry!
{21396}{21443}Let me get my checkbook!
{21450}{21571}You don't have to do this. The|strength inside you means the most.
{21577}{21680}You're loyal, you're honest|and you have integrity.
{21687}{21753}That's the strength I want in a man.
{21759}{21835}That means nothing to me. Come on!
{21889}{21926}- Hi, liar.|- Hey.
{21964}{22085}He's marrying you because he thinks|the things you were saying were true.
{22092}{22153}- They could be true.|- But they're not.
{22174}{22213}It's a fine line.
{22237}{22303}- Why are you lying?|- I don't know.
{22309}{22437}He did this stuff, I said I did it|too. He got so excited, it was fun.
{22467}{22578}It's a disgusting habit,|and I want you to quit now!
{22589}{22644}She's helped so many people quit.
{22669}{22706}We'd better get going.
{22712}{22780}- You have a church group meeting.|- Right.
{22888}{22972}- It was nice meeting you.|- You too.
{22978}{23071}And, Ursula, it was really nice|meeting you tonight!
{23079}{23176}Come on! Bunny versus Doodie.|We're waiting!
{23223}{23303}Okay, guys. One match,|winner take all.
{23334}{23387}Wait. What does the winner get?
{23392}{23439}- Pride.|- And dignity.
{23446}{23507}Okay, if you say so.
{23514}{23561}All right, ready, set, go!
{23568}{23627}- Come on!|- Come on!
{23799}{23931}- Wow, they're both really strong.|- Or equally weak.
{23944}{24028}Oh, God. Chandler's making|his sex face.
{24164}{24289}- So you getting tired?|- No. I could do this all day.
{24295}{24352}Yeah. Me too.
{24404}{24498}- Getting a little tired, though.|- God, I'm exhausted.
{24504}{24627}This is starting to look bad for me,|okay? Mona's standing right there.
{24656}{24753}She's talking to Joey!|You've got to let me win!
{24760}{24826}Let me win.|My wife thinks I'm a wimp.
{24832}{24966}At least you have a wife.|I get divorces and knock people up.
{25007}{25073}And I'm dressed as doodie.
{25094}{25232}- You're Spud-nik.|- Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.
{25251}{25306}Please? She's watching.
{25328}{25406}- Fine.|- Thanks.
{25421}{25491}- Oh, no.|- Oh, yeah!
{25520}{25561}My hero!
{25567}{25622}You're a weird lady.
{25708}{25769}Ursula said she left her purse.
{25775}{25863}What a relief. It has the numbers|for her prayer chain.
{25870}{25919}I'm sure it does.
{25929}{25997}Guess I'll see you at the wedding.
{26038}{26118}I don't think I'm gonna make it|to the wedding.
{26125}{26213}- I wish you all the luck in the world.|- We'll be okay.
{26218}{26321}It's so perfect,|and she's been saving herself for me.
{26369}{26461}- I can't let you do this. She's lying.|- What?
{26468}{26567}She is lying. And I bet|I could prove it. Excuse me.
{26573}{26649}Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.
{26656}{26786}But what looks like a detailed drawing|of a bank floor plan.
{26792}{26909}Here's the name tag from|where she works as a waitress.
{26916}{26969}Not a teacher, a waitress.
{26976}{27037}Here, she always lies about this.
{27044}{27157}- How old did she say she was?|- She told me she was 25.
{27163}{27224}I almost don't want to show you.
{27231}{27303}Just remember, I'm a minute younger.
{27364}{27421}I am so stupid.
{27428}{27481}Of course she's not a teacher.
{27487}{27617}There's no such thing as a "Top Secret|School for the Children of Spies."
{27669}{27722}No, you're not stupid.
{27743}{27796}I'm not smart.
{27874}{27985}I just wanted so much|to be impulsive for once.
{27992}{28037}- To be romantic.|- Good.
{28042}{28184}You should be impulsive and romantic.|You did it with the wrong person.
{28249}{28337}- What?|- It's weird, two people look so alike.
{28344}{28385}And so different.
{28442}{28512}Eric! Let's go!
{28529}{28632}- Better go deal with it.|- Yeah, you should.
{28759}{28837}Hurry up! I gotta pray!
{29104}{29192}I had to give the kid|50 bucks to stop crying.
{29199}{29225}That's not bad.
{29231}{29327}I also had to go to a few houses|as his girlfriend.
{29354}{29405}I am awful with children.
{29414}{29517}You're good with kids.|They're just crazy on Halloween.
{29524}{29606}They're all greedy,|hopped up on sugar.
{29612}{29673}- That's all it is?|- Absolutely.
{29679}{29837}Halloween is the worst. Except|for Christmas. And their birthdays.
{29844}{29918}They get crazy during the summer too.
{29924}{30006}And any time they're|hungry or sleepy.
{30012}{30086}Kids are tough.|Good luck with that.
{30198}{30262}Look, I'm sorry you lost.
{30274}{30356}I got a secret for you.|I let him win.
{30377}{30437}Was that a secret, or a lie?
{30444}{30493}- No, I let him... Ross?|- Yeah?
{30499}{30573}Would you tell her|I let you win, please?
{30589}{30667}Chandler "let me win."
{30685}{30823}No, Chandler's really strong.|My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?
{30829}{30903}I am strong. I'll show you.
{30909}{30942}Chandler, please.
{30949}{30994}What's the matter? Scared?
{31019}{31087}Let's go, big bunny!
{31094}{31182}One, two, three. Go!
{31289}{31361}I'm gonna kill myself!

{180}{301}Oh, my God, you cleaned!|Look at these floors!
{307}{399}You did the windows!|I have been begging for months!
{405}{526}- And nagging works!|- No, I didn't actually do this.
{531}{621}Oh, no. Was I cleaning|in my sleep again?
{631}{662}No, it wasn't you.
{667}{756}- Well, then, who?|- I got a maid. Yay!
{770}{903}I hope you mean "mistress," because|if some other woman was cleaning...
{908}{993}I know you don't like|to relinquish control.
{999}{1081}"Relinquish" is just a fancy word|for "lose."
{1087}{1241}She's nice, and she mentioned that she|adored how you arranged the sponges.
{1257}{1297}Did she really say that?
{1303}{1391}Yes, I distinctly remember.|I thought it was a joke.
{1396}{1496}- Now, just give her a chance, okay?|- Fine, I can do it.
{1540}{1661}- What's the matter?|- Usually when I'm anxious, I clean.

{2671}{2772}Whose cell phone is that?|It's so annoying.
{2777}{2846}I think it's coming from your bag.
{2893}{2961}I never get calls!
{2967}{3006}Hello?
{3011}{3159}Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween|party. Ursula's fiance.
{3164}{3250}Oh, my God, Eric, hi!|How'd you get this number?
{3255}{3332}I have a friend who's a cop,|and he got it.
{3337}{3459}Wow. What an incredible violation|and wonderful surprise!
{3464}{3538}You should know|I broke up with Ursula.
{3543}{3609}Oh, you did?|He did it, he did it!
{3614}{3696}- What did he do?|- Shh! I'm talking!
{3719}{3869}Anyway, I was wondering if you were|the sort of person who eats lunch?
{3874}{3936}Are you asking me out?
{3942}{4049}Because it'd be weird since you|just broke up with my sister.
{4054}{4167}Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. Bye.
{4172}{4266}Wait! I said that so you'd think|I was a good person!
{4293}{4341}Fight for me!
{4346}{4436}I won't take "no" for an answer.
{4441}{4502}Not great, we can work on it.
{4507}{4586}{y:i}I can be at your apartment|{y:i}in two hours.
{4591}{4649}How do you know where I live?
{4654}{4716}I've got friends too.
{4721}{4751}Okay, bye.
{4766}{4830}Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!
{4835}{4947}This day is gonna be much better|than I thought it was gonna be.
{4953}{5021}Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.
{5087}{5154}So apparently I'm available|for lunch.
{5159}{5222}I can't. I'm apartment hunting.
{5227}{5263}You're moving?
{5268}{5341}I can't live with Joey|once the baby comes.
{5347}{5460}I don't want my child's first words|to be, "How you doin'?"
{5481}{5529}Does Joey know you're moving?
{5534}{5604}We haven't discussed it,|but he'll be relieved.
{5610}{5727}He brought this girl over,|and I talked about morning sickness.
{5733}{5789}I showed her my pregnancy book.
{5794}{5881}- That's not really porn?|- Not so much.
{5887}{6033}I heard in the elevator this morning|that a woman in my building died.
{6038}{6181}Oh, my God. Was she old?|Does she have a view?
{6193}{6296}How great would that be?|You living in my building?
{6302}{6398}I could take care of the baby,|come over whenever I want...
{6403}{6440}...with your permission.
{6445}{6541}That really would be great.|Well, can we see it?
{6547}{6632}Maybe we shouldn't.|If she just died this morning.
{6637}{6717}Yeah. No. No, you're right.
{6811}{6866}- Shall we?|- Yeah.
{7048}{7084}Yes?
{7089}{7161}Hi. I'm Ross Geller.|I live in the building.
{7167}{7276}And I'm Rachel,|an admirer of the building.
{7290}{7431}I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing|away, and I am so sorry for your loss.
{7436}{7490}- She didn't pass away.|- What?
{7495}{7606}- My mother's still alive.|- Oh, thank God!
{7629}{7766}It looked like we were gonna lose her|this morning, but she's tough.
{7771}{7811}Are you close with her?
{7817}{7926}Of course. She and I would|talk all the time...
{7931}{8008}...in the laundry room.
{8013}{8076}You speak Dutch?
{8228}{8321}I would, but it's just too painful.
{8353}{8416}So she's really not dead.
{8421}{8501}No. She's hanging in there.
{8506}{8648}Could you tell me, is she hanging in|in a one-bedroom or a two?
{8733}{8831}This tile cleaner is incredible.|Where did you get it?
{8836}{8912}Oh, well...|I make it myself.
{8917}{9042}It's two parts ammonia and one part|lemon juice. The secret ingredient...
{9047}{9121}You know what? We just met.
{9126}{9222}Okay. I'm gonna get the clothes|from the laundry room...
{9228}{9289}...then I'll clean behind the fridge.
{9304}{9334}I love her!
{9377}{9436}I'll be back in a minute.
{9456}{9503}Okay.
{9508}{9616}- See? I told you.|- She stole my jeans!
{9656}{9696}What?
{9708}{9776}I've been looking|for them all week!
{9781}{9891}So she stole your pants,|and then came back and wore them?
{9896}{9991}Don't you see?|It's the perfect crime!
{9997}{10070}She must have been|planning this for years!
{10075}{10106}I'll prove it.
{10112}{10234}I dropped a pen in my lap, and it left|an ink stain on the crotch.
{10239}{10351}When she comes back, I will find it|and show you that stain!
{10401}{10541}Is it possible the company that sold|the jeans made more than one pair?
{10546}{10575}I guess.
{10580}{10726}Shouldn't we give her the benefit of|the doubt before we search her crotch?
{10748}{10842}Fine. I'm glad I didn't give|her my secret ingredient.
{10846}{10938}By the way,|what is your secret ingredient?
{11076}{11166}- Hi.|- Come in. I'm so glad you're here.
{11171}{11196}Yeah. Me too.
{11201}{11282}Not in the shaky, angry way|you are, though.
{11288}{11389}Sorry. I just saw Ursula.|I got the engagement ring back.
{11394}{11473}Just seeing her brought it all back.
{11479}{11559}All the lies, the way she used me.
{11565}{11667}I just... I get so angry,|just looking at her...
{11732}{11856}- Face.|- Yeah. Yeah.
{11869}{11986}I'm sorry. It's just,|when I look at you...
{11992}{12041}...I see her.
{12053}{12181}And when I see her,|I get a little bit angry.
{12233}{12290}- Maybe this is too weird.|- Wait.
{12295}{12406}There's only a problem|when I look at you.
{12423}{12481}I got it. I got it.
{12494}{12560}No, don't tear out your eyes!
{12565}{12677}- I was just gonna take out my lenses.|- Oh, yeah. Try that.
{12734}{12791}So, is that better?
{12796}{12846}Not really.
{12877}{13031}You're blurry, but you still|look like Ursula. You're "Blursula."
{13063}{13171}Okay, wait. Maybe...
{13190}{13281}If I just don't look at you|for a while.
{13322}{13466}See? It works. I'm not angry at|all anymore. This is a great date!
{13483}{13556}Look, Eric, turn around.
{13592}{13699}I like you, but it shouldn't be|this hard. It's our first date.
{13705}{13786}It's supposed to be|about excitement and...
{13791}{13924}..."He touched my hand,|did he mean to?" and first kisses...
{13973}{14031}Second kisses...
{14100}{14181}Thanks for the coffee, or:
{14430}{14491}Yeah, we're done.
{14651}{14776}Hey, Ross. You wanna go see|that new IMAX movie on tide pools?
{14781}{14831}- Really?|- No.
{14877}{14946}But I got Knicks tickets for us.
{14951}{15011}- Sweet!|- All right, let's go.
{15017}{15062}I have to stop by my place.
{15067}{15196}To tape the game? You do this every|time. You're not gonna be on TV!
{15201}{15271}I have to see if this apartment|is available.
{15276}{15358}- You're switching apartments?|- It's for Rachel.
{15363}{15437}- She has an apartment.|- She's gonna move.
{15442}{15490}- She is?|- Yeah.
{15495}{15579}You didn't expect her|to live there with the baby?
{15584}{15647}I didn't really think about it.
{15765}{15853}Hey, Gunther, you're an "ezel"!
{15932}{15986}Damn it!
{16078}{16139}- Nice jeans.|- Oh, thanks.
{16144}{16251}- I like your top.|- Oh. You're not getting it.
{16420}{16526}- What happened?|- Oh. I fell asleep!
{16545}{16615}I was thinking about taking|my lunch break.
{16620}{16737}Will you do the top of the cabinets?|That'll work up your appetite.
{16743}{16786}All right.
{17333}{17386}Hello.
{17408}{17438}What's going on?
{17443}{17561}I'm sorry. I've never had a maid|before. Is this not okay?
{17727}{17870}- How was the game?|- It was okay. I ate way too much.
{17950}{18034}Ross said you were looking|for a new place.
{18039}{18173}Yeah. Hopefully across the street.|If certain Dutch people would let go.
{18213}{18281}I was kind of hoping you'd stay.
{18290}{18376}Joey, I have to go.|There's no room for a baby.
{18382}{18491}No room? It's a baby.|It's, like, this big.
{18496}{18593}You could put it over here.
{18599}{18673}Or we could put it right here.|Cute, right?
{18679}{18761}Or over here.|You wouldn't even notice it.
{18766}{18846}"Where's the baby?"|"Oh, it's right over..."
{18866}{18954}Honey, it's not just a matter|of where you put it.
{18960}{19041}A baby changes things.|They cry all the time.
{19046}{19161}Imagine bringing home a girl,|trying to score with a screaming baby.
{19166}{19251}I could use a challenge.|It's getting pretty easy.
{19256}{19346}It's so sweet that you want me|to stay, but I can't.
{19351}{19426}It would disrupt your entire life.
{19435}{19561}It's just...|I love living with you so much.
{19566}{19665}- I wish things didn't have to change.|- I know.
{19670}{19741}You know, I blame Ross for this.
{19772}{19826}I do too, a little bit.
{19856}{19912}I'm gonna miss you.
{19918}{19980}You're the hottest roommate|I ever had.
{20121}{20213}Oh, no, I have to go.|I have a massage appointment.
{20218}{20312}No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.|I'll pay you.
{20317}{20396}No, I've gotten in trouble|for that before.
{20403}{20486}- See you later?|- Absolutely.
{20521}{20569}I love the way you kiss.
{20574}{20686}Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!|You'll see.
{20856}{20946}- Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.|- How come?
{20951}{21018}Because I put my head|between her legs.
{21023}{21093}- To see her pants?|- They're my pants!
{21098}{21143}Did you see the stain?
{21148}{21249}No. I was getting into position,|and everything went dark.
{21255}{21347}She is not stealing from us.|Will you let this go?
{21353}{21396}Fine.
{21516}{21608}- She's wearing my bra!|- Oh, dear God!
{21613}{21679}My pink flowered bra!|I recognize the strap!
{21684}{21762}Yet you don't recognize|that you're crazy?
{21768}{21854}I'm leaving, and you're gonna look|at Brenda's bra.
{21859}{21926}Here's another plan. No.
{21931}{22009}I would, but she thinks|I'm attracted to her.
{22014}{22101}- Why?|- Did you not hear where my head was?
{22119}{22188}We're a team.|We're in this together.
{22193}{22286}I fear a jury will see it|the same way.
{22303}{22395}I catch you looking|at women's breasts all the time.
{22400}{22452}You see that?
{22458}{22494}Do you see this?
{22553}{22612}All right.|Okay. I get your point.
{22617}{22685}If it's not her bra,|will you let her clean?
{22690}{22844}Yes. You'll know it's mine because on|the right, there's a noticeable rip.
{22876}{22941}You need new clothes.
{23047}{23128}- Hi. How is she?|- It's not looking good.
{23225}{23335}Well, I brought her some "bloemen."
{23340}{23476}Would you like to say goodbye?|I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
{23481}{23561}Oh, I don't know that it would.
{23566}{23676}- Well, her memory is pretty much gone.|- All right, then.
{23868}{23941}- Hey!|- Welcome back.
{23978}{24088}- Shall we continue?|- I'm still tired from this afternoon.
{24093}{24147}- Why?|- The sex.
{24152}{24197}- What sex?|- Our sex.
{24202}{24234}We didn't have sex.
{24239}{24351}If it wasn't with you, I had sex|with somebody that looked like...
{24515}{24606}- You had sex with Ursula?|- A little bit.
{24611}{24684}I thought she was you|and I kissed her and...
{24689}{24816}- You didn't notice different clothes?|- I was just so excited to see you.
{24918}{24999}- This is too weird.|- I don't wanna lose you.
{25004}{25099}It's like I was saying to Ursula|when I was making love...
{25105}{25156}Yeah. It's too weird.
{25193}{25255}So I guess this is it.
{25260}{25309}Yeah.
{25335}{25391}Maybe it's for the best.
{25397}{25488}- You smell just like her.|- Yeah, so do you.
{25940}{26040}- What are you doing?|- I'm leaning.
{26045}{26106}This is where I lean.
{26131}{26169}Okay.
{26247}{26286}- Brenda, a bee!|- What?
{26292}{26426}It flew into your blouse! Better|undo your buttons lest it sting you.
{26455}{26559}- I think I know what's going on here.|- You do?
{26564}{26661}Look, I know it must be hard|that your wife is a lesbian...
{26706}{26771}...but it's wrong. You're married.
{26776}{26854}- I totally understand.|- Okay, good.
{26859}{26924}Could I just see your bra?
{27072}{27160}- Where'd you get those jeans?|- You gave them to me.
{27165}{27256}- No, I didn't!|- All right, I took them.
{27261}{27350}I figured it was okay,|you've got an ink stain on it.
{27355}{27446}- Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?|- What bra?
{27451}{27566}- The pink one with the flowers.|- You mean the one you're wearing?
{27650}{27693}I quit!
{27720}{27769}Sounds about right.
{27938}{27967}What is this?
{27973}{28033}This is just to give you an idea.
{28039}{28199}We can put screens so the baby has|privacy, and a mobile over the crib...
{28204}{28346}...and here's a baby monitor which,|for now, we can use as walkie-talkies.
{28366}{28448}You're so sweet!
{28454}{28566}Oh, my God!|And you gave the baby Hugsy!
{28688}{28777}That's really just to show|where the baby would go.
{28783}{28868}Why don't I hold on to him|so there's no confusion?
{28950}{29043}Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.|It's gonna be loud.
{29048}{29110}- I'm loud.|- It'll be up all night.
{29115}{29169}- I'm up all night.|- It'll poop.
{29174}{29231}Hello!
{29261}{29306}What about all the women?
{29311}{29401}If I'm bringing home a woman|who can't stand a baby...
{29406}{29482}...then maybe I don't wanna|be with that woman.
{29487}{29576}Or maybe we'll do it|in the bathroom of the club!
{29593}{29631}Joey, are you sure?
{29636}{29728}Yeah. Look, I know sometimes|it'll be hard, okay...
{29734}{29863}...but it'll also be really,|really great.
{29869}{29971}Please, Rachel,|I really want you to stay.
{30000}{30111}I want me to stay too. Thank you.
{30152}{30273}- Look at this crib! It's so cute!|- I know. I found it on the street.
{30278}{30376}Are you...? Really?|This is in such good condition.
{30381}{30436}Whoa! What's under the cover?
{30441}{30498}- I don't know.|- It's moving.
{30503}{30557}It's got a tail! Get it out!
{30562}{30601}Okay!
{30772}{30873}Well, the old lady died.|And how do I know?
{30878}{30976}Because her dying wish|was for one last kiss.
{31008}{31105}But I don't care because|you got the apartment. Yes!
{31110}{31255}Yeah. I think I'm gonna stay here.
{31260}{31309}Isn't that great?

{120}{203}I'm having dinner with my dad|tomorrow. Wanna come?
{208}{283}Sure. He's kind of sexy.
{290}{330}I'll be there too.
{335}{460}So we'll come up with a signal.|If it's going well, you can take off.
{475}{565}I need your support.|I haven't told him I'm pregnant.
{570}{600}Oh. Why not?
{605}{681}He's gonna flip out.|I hate it when he's angry.
{686}{752}This is all so "Papa Don't Preach."
{757}{841}He's scary.|Once, he caught me smoking.
{846}{933}He said if I did it again,|he'd make me eat the pack.
{939}{998}Wow. Well, I will be there.
{1003}{1103}I won't let that man|make you eat your baby!
{1139}{1223}Hey, who is that guy?|I think I know him.
{1243}{1273}No, you don't.
{1278}{1400}Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper|from your bachelorette party!
{1464}{1508}Her what?
{1547}{1613}Your secret bachelorette party.
{1625}{1734}- Bachelorette party?|- She untied his G-string with her teeth.
{1758}{1812}Somebody stop me!
{1825}{1952}We weren't gonna have parties.|We agreed that it's a silly tradition.
{1957}{2023}It's a grand tradition!
{2032}{2113}They surprised me.|There was nothing I could do.
{2118}{2189}You could've untied it|with your hands.
{2195}{2303}This is so unfair. I wanted|to throw a bachelor party...
{2307}{2382}...but I wasn't allowed.|All we got was dinner.
{2387}{2461}You went home with the waitress.
{2475}{2543}Yeah, that was a good night.
{2548}{2598}Why didn't you tell me?
{2603}{2702}The two pillars of marriage|are openness and honesty.
{2708}{2827}I knew giving you that book would|come back and bite me in the ass.

{3815}{3922}- I'll order everyone the chicken.|- Oh, I don't eat meat.
{3938}{3965}It's chicken!
{3995}{4091}- I don't eat that either.|- I never understand you lesbians.
{4158}{4260}- So, what's new with you?|- Well, actually...
{4266}{4313}Your '74 Lafite, sir.
{4319}{4424}I ordered the '75. That's a|magnificent wine. '74 is sewage!
{4429}{4503}Why would you bring me sewage?
{4509}{4604}Are you an idiot?|Is that why you're a waiter?
{4609}{4672}This is why I didn't want|to wait on you.
{4677}{4748}Oh, come on.|Don't be such a baby.
{4800}{4901}In case you didn't notice,|that is a scary man.
{4906}{4993}He's right, though.|The '74 is absolute piss.
{5036}{5122}This was a huge mistake.|I can't tell him. I can't.
{5127}{5152}Rachel...
{5157}{5290}I'm gonna wait a couple of years,|and then the baby will tell him.
{5303}{5424}- Why? So he can get mad at the baby?|- That's the baby's problem.
{5495}{5616}- Everything okay with the waiter?|- I don't know. I went to the bathroom.
{5669}{5781}So, sweetie, you were starting|to tell me what's new with you.
{5887}{5935}I got TiVo.
{5954}{6053}- What's TiVo?|- It's slang for "pregnant."
{6174}{6211}Are you pregnant?
{6221}{6293}Well, yes and no.
{6301}{6350}Except, not no.
{6357}{6410}So to sum it up, yeah.
{6415}{6516}Who is the father?|Please don't tell me it's her!
{6575}{6637}No, it's Ross. You like Ross.
{6704}{6754}I hope you're okay with this.
{6760}{6844}This is a good thing.|This is your first grandchild!
{6849}{6906}You're gonna be a poppy!
{6911}{6988}That's true. I'm a poppy!
{7004}{7079}I'm gonna be a poppy!
{7145}{7214}- So when is the wedding?|- The who?
{7244}{7323}The wedding.|There's going to be a wedding.
{7328}{7462}Young lady, don't you tell me my first|grandchild is gonna be a bastard!
{7469}{7583}- Tell me there's gonna be a wedding!|- February 2nd!
{7725}{7786}It was cool seeing you lecture today.
{7791}{7902}Thanks. Although it seemed like|you were falling asleep.
{7908}{8038}No, I had my eyes closed so I could|concentrate and take it all in.
{8043}{8119}A lot of my students do that.
{8131}{8217}- I've got to get going.|- I'll see you tonight?
{8270}{8400}Thanks for showing me your semiprecious|stone collection. It was amazing.
{8453}{8514}My God, you must be good in bed.
{8550}{8623}So you and Mona. It's been a while.|How is it?
{8638}{8678}It's going good.
{8683}{8765}I mean, we get along great.|She's so...
{8771}{8848}- Hot?|- I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!
{8872}{8921}She's okay with the baby?
{8926}{9027}I haven't actually told her yet.|I don't wanna scare her off.
{9032}{9136}You have to be honest, or you may|think you're on the same path...
{9140}{9193}...but you're on different ones.
{9198}{9303}I'm gonna take that book|and beat you to death with it.
{9322}{9393}You are gonna love me so much.
{9398}{9463}I felt bad about|the bachelorette party...
{9468}{9547}...so tonight you're gonna have|a bachelor party.
{9552}{9668}I got this number from a guy at work|and I hired a stripper for you.
{9682}{9767}I'm going in the wife hall of fame!
{9772}{9879}- Honey, I don't want a stripper.|- Will you let the lady talk?
{9900}{9985}Come on, it'll be fun.|It'll make me feel better.
{9990}{10127}I appreciate it, but it's a little|creepy. I'm not a bachelor anymore.
{10133}{10243}Just think of it as|a two-month anniversary present.
{10249}{10349}Sure. One year is paper,|but two months is lap dance.
{10381}{10479}Please, I feel so bad.|Just watch the hot woman get naked!
{10496}{10578}- Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.|- Yeah!
{10609}{10657}And Joey.
{10663}{10793}- Who else do you wanna invite?|- Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
{10798}{10880}I can't make it.|I'm seeing Mona tonight.
{10886}{10974}Why cancel a real date|to go to a fake bachelor party?
{10980}{11060}I'm sorry.|I gotta cancel tonight, baby.
{11169}{11293}I'm sorry I won't make it to your|imaginary wedding. I'm busy that day.
{11314}{11431}I already have a unicorn baptism|and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
{11497}{11538}I know. I panicked.
{11543}{11660}I didn't want him yelling at me|like I was some '74 Latour.
{11666}{11708}It's Lafite.
{11717}{11801}The '74 Latour is actually|drinking quite nicely.
{11847}{11927}I'm gonna tell him.|I'm gonna be strong.
{11943}{11985}I just called a friend.
{12002}{12103}I think I may be able|to book the Plaza on short notice.
{12128}{12168}Really?
{12178}{12213}The Plaza?
{12218}{12272}Oh, Daddy!
{12301}{12394}- Daddy, I need to talk to you.|- What is it, sweetie?
{12435}{12504}Ross and I aren't getting married.
{12509}{12567}- I'm sorry.|- I don't believe this!
{12572}{12663}- Stay calm, please.|- How do you expect me to stay calm?
{12668}{12757}This is unacceptable, Rachel.|And I wanna know why!
{12762}{12833}Is it because that punk|won't marry you?
{12839}{12936}- Is that it?|- Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.
{13142}{13202}You nervous about getting married?
{13266}{13308}What are you doing?
{13318}{13422}Pretend it's a real bachelor party.|It'll be more fun.
{13428}{13530}All right. I can't believe|tomorrow's the big day.
{13559}{13645}You're never gonna be|with another woman.
{13649}{13760}You have to wake up|to the same face every day...
{13764}{13859}...until you finally have|the sweet release of death.
{13892}{13969}You're right. This is more fun.
{14000}{14052}That's her! Okay, come on!
{14282}{14333}Which one of you is Chandler?
{14338}{14383}That's me!
{14416}{14441}That's me.
{14477}{14550}Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.
{14577}{14651}- Is that a bedroom?|- Yeah, right over there.
{14656}{14703}Whenever you're ready.
{14757}{14792}That was weird.
{14804}{14898}- Why would she go in the bedroom?|- I'm waiting.
{15115}{15223}- So she's a...|- Yeah, that's one naked hooker.
{15250}{15353}I love your place.|Where is this guy from?
{15358}{15438}That's an 18th-century artifact|from Calcutta.
{15443}{15475}Oh. Wow.
{15482}{15587}So you're more than just dinosaurs.
{15603}{15648}So much more.
{15797}{15858}Oh, my God! I am so sorry!
{15863}{15917}Forget it. It's from Pier 1.
{16023}{16057}Sorry.
{16150}{16234}Think you can knock up my daughter|and not marry her?
{16240}{16298}I ought to kill you!
{16355}{16443}This is actually not|a great time for me.
{16555}{16644}So come on.|Explain yourself, Geller.
{16649}{16720}- You got Rachel pregnant!|- You got her pregnant?
{16726}{16769}- Who did?|- You did!
{16802}{16903}Yes, but it was a one-night thing.|It meant nothing.
{16908}{17001}Oh? Really? My daughter means nothing?
{17007}{17099}No, sir. She means a lot to me.|I love Rachel.
{17104}{17166}- What?|- But not that way.
{17171}{17243}I'm not in love.|I love her like a friend.
{17247}{17332}So you get her in trouble|and refuse to marry her?
{17337}{17442}I offered to marry her.|But I didn't want to.
{17480}{17552}Why not? You wanted to be|with this tramp?
{17556}{17588}Tramp?
{17593}{17678}I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona.|Mona, Dr. Green.
{17718}{17805}I can't believe there is|a naked hooker in there!
{17810}{17875}Maybe she's a hooker|and a stripper...
{17879}{17951}...but she got confused|about what to do.
{17966}{18052}Maybe. Technically, she stripped.|We just missed it.
{18145}{18183}Ma'am?
{18211}{18263}Are you also a stripper?
{18269}{18344}No, but I can pretend to strip.|Costs extra.
{18349}{18422}Here's the extras:|Handcuffs, spanking...
{18485}{18549}Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.
{18554}{18643}Getting her husband a hooker.|That's pretty funny.
{18659}{18759}That is funny. Maybe for my birthday|she'll murder someone.
{18764}{18881}I'll bet Ross was in on it.|He was conveniently busy.
{18892}{18982}- You mind if I smoke in here?|- Actually, I'd rather...
{18998}{19087}Go ahead. We're gonna have to|burn that room, anyway.
{19132}{19224}- How could you hide this?|- I wanted to tell you, but...
{19229}{19318}You'd get what you wanted,|then dump her, like Rachel.
{19324}{19428}Hey, I did not dump Rachel.|Nor are we still together.
{19511}{19548}Can l...?
{19590}{19653}We'll just let the machine get that.
{19681}{19749}"Ross", "it's Joey."|{y:i}There's a hooker here.
{19754}{19828}{y:i}We thought you'd|{y:i}know something about it.
{19833}{19878}No! No! No!
{19884}{19912}No!
{19917}{19973}I need to lie down.
{20084}{20151}Tonight's the bachelor party?
{20156}{20248}- Thanks for that number.|- No problem. Who's the party for?
{20253}{20334}- My husband.|- You hired your husband a hooker?
{20343}{20402}- She's a stripper.|- No, a hooker.
{20423}{20511}- Is that a name for strippers?|- Lf they're hookers.
{20516}{20593}Stu, I can't believe you did this.
{20598}{20645}You're sure she's a hooker?
{20651}{20767}Either that, or she's the best,|most expensive date I ever had.
{20839}{20968}- Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.|- Why would she do that?
{20974}{21045}Maybe she wants you|to learn something.
{21094}{21193}Is there anything|you're really bad at, sexually?
{21210}{21291}This is the worst|bachelor party ever.
{21302}{21389}- What's taking you boys so long?|- In a minute!
{21395}{21460}What's gonna happen in a minute?
{21470}{21529}You should ask her to leave.
{21535}{21583}- Why me?|- It's your party.
{21594}{21702}- Which is why you should do it.|- No, you do it.
{21707}{21807}Rock, paper, scissors|for who tells the whore to leave.
{21885}{21959}- What?|- I miss this.
{21965}{22045}I don't think we've|done this before.
{22052}{22110}No, I miss hanging out with you.
{22116}{22191}- We still hang out.|- Not like we used to.
{22199}{22269}Remember? We used to be inseparable.
{22275}{22388}You know, now it's like|things are different.
{22394}{22494}Well, you know, things are different.|I'm married now.
{22500}{22578}Don't get me wrong,|I'm happy for you guys.
{22584}{22708}I just miss hanging out.|Just us, you know?
{22735}{22780}Yeah, I miss that too.
{22786}{22864}From now on,|we'll make time to hang out.
{22870}{22938}You got it. Come here.
{23007}{23042}Oh, God.
{23048}{23140}Listen, I am this close|to robbing you guys.
{23163}{23211}She's a hooker!|She's a...
{23265}{23350}Hi. We spoke on the phone.
{23466}{23532}So your dad dropped by.
{23537}{23590}He's a pleasant man.
{23595}{23676}- Oh, no.|- I better go.
{23828}{23904}Just over here.|I can't miss the fight.
{23910}{23953}Ross, I am so sorry.
{23959}{24043}I'll straighten this out|tomorrow in person.
{24048}{24087}Or via e-mail.
{24109}{24228}I don't care about your dad.|Mona is totally freaked out!
{24234}{24317}I'll fix that too.|What's her e-mail?
{24343}{24415}I'll fix this.|I swear I'll talk to her.
{24421}{24462}Okay. Thank you.
{24487}{24568}That's it?|You call that a fight?
{24573}{24689}"We were on a break!" "No we weren't!"|What happened to you two?
{24830}{24912}Thank you so much|for coming back over.
{24937}{24983}Oh, good. You're here.
{24989}{25076}And I was worried that|it would be uncomfortable.
{25081}{25128}Mona, just hear me out.
{25134}{25228}I'm sorry about my father|yelling at you.
{25233}{25318}But you held your own.|You have to tell me how.
{25323}{25378}- Focus.|- Okay.
{25395}{25459}Yes, Ross and I used to date.
{25464}{25544}And yes, we are gonna have a baby.
{25550}{25645}But we are definitely not|getting back together.
{25651}{25738}- How can I be sure?|- We drove each other crazy.
{25748}{25888}He was possessive, jealous.|He couldn't let the little things go.
{25894}{25944}Trying to date this woman.
{25950}{26058}None of that compared|to how kind and gentle...
{26063}{26116}...and thoughtful he is.
{26122}{26192}You probably shouldn't touch me.
{26201}{26288}I don't want something so complicated.
{26293}{26374}But what relationship|is not complicated?
{26380}{26448}We all have our baggage.|You must too.
{26454}{26529}Why else would you still be single?
{26534}{26594}I'm so gonna leave right now.
{26668}{26717}Should I leave this open?
{26737}{26827}I'm not sure.|Why didn't you just tell me?
{26832}{26909}It has nothing to do|with how I feel.
{26915}{27023}- You still should have told me.|- I was going to...
{27028}{27143}...but I thought you should hear it|from Rachel's father.
{27163}{27207}I made a mistake...
{27213}{27321}...but it's only because|I really like you. Really.
{27344}{27458}Okay. I guess you can|close the door now.
{27730}{27831}Forgot my purse.|Oh, you guys made up.
{27882}{27947}Good kisser, isn't he?|I'm going!
{28090}{28168}I swear I didn't know|she was a hooker.
{28197}{28233}You let her smoke?
{28248}{28382}Her ass-print is still on our quilt.|Really want to talk about smoking?
{28407}{28473}I'm gonna make this up to you.
{28478}{28519}I promised a stripper...
{28565}{28657}...and you're gonna get a stripper.
{28688}{28732}- Monica, wait.|- What?
{28753}{28802}Carry on.
{29180}{29284}These tennis shoes are so tight.
{29300}{29406}- I think I'll take them off.|- Could you not narrate?
{29435}{29485}Gotcha, sailor.
{29677}{29746}{y:i}Just because|{y:i}you're not in love...
{29815}{29896}- You told your dad the truth.|- An hour ago.
{29918}{29983}- Wanna go see a movie?|- Yes.
{30039}{30094}Bye, Dad.
{30204}{30294}{y:i}It's unacceptable! What does love|{y:i}have to do with it?
{30300}{30384}{y:i}There are more important things|{y:i}than love.
{30477}{30583}{y:i}You have to think about|{y:i}the consequences of your decisions!
{30630}{30742}I do think about|the consequences of my decisions!
{30764}{30823}What gives you the right to...?
{30828}{30883}Go to hell!
{30959}{31082}Stupid guy on my phone.

{804}{930}And after the baby's born|they're great for shoplifting melons.
{980}{1059}Good, you're all here.|Thanksgiving, 4:00.
{1064}{1180}Guess who I invited? Remember|Will Culvert from high school?
{1186}{1239}- No.|- He was in Ross' class.
{1245}{1356}Marching band, was kind of|overweight. Really overweight.
{1362}{1400}I was his thin friend.
{1454}{1559}I don't remember. Are you talking|about your imaginary boyfriend?
{1564}{1635}No, that was Jared.
{1662}{1755}Wow. Haven't thought about him|in a long time.
{1810}{1916}Will's here on business|so I invited him here.
{1921}{2026}- That's nice.|- Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.
{2032}{2115}He looks good.|Okay, I mean really gorgeous.
{2224}{2335}- I still love Chandler.|- Wouldn't hurt you to say it.
{2372}{2454}Just so you know,|I'm not gonna make a turkey.
{2470}{2524}- What?|- Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.
{2530}{2635}- Phoebe!|- Turkeys are intelligent animals.
{2642}{2753}No, they're not! They're ugly|and stupid and delicious!
{2758}{2877}It's not just Phoebe. Chandler doesn't|eat Thanksgiving food...
{2883}{2945}...and Rachel has|her poultry aversion.
{2950}{3031}I had to leave when you had|that chicken.
{3036}{3147}I thought that was because|I put it on my hand and made it walk.
{3176}{3294}It's not worth it to make|a whole turkey. It's a lot of work.
{3300}{3359}But you gotta have turkey!
{3366}{3478}Thanksgiving with no turkey is like|Fourth of July with no pie.
{3483}{3560}Or Friday with no two pizzas.
{3586}{3671}Fine. But there's gonna|be a ton left over.
{3676}{3737}No, I will finish that turkey.
{3742}{3836}You can eat almost an entire turkey|in one sitting?
{3842}{3984}That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!|This is what we do.
{3990}{4085}We may not be great|thinkers or world leaders...
{4092}{4204}...we don't read a lot or run fast,|but damn it, we can eat!

{5088}{5159}{y:i}Four wide receivers. On third and 18.
{5166}{5299}Isn't it weird how next year|there will be a baby at the table?
{5372}{5461}Rachel's. But good to know|where you're at.
{5478}{5509}- Hey!|- Hey!
{5516}{5561}- Happy Thanksgiving.|- You too!
{5568}{5612}- Can I help?|- Yes.
{5618}{5691}Chandler usually helps|but he's into the game.
{5698}{5816}Could you fold these napkins?|I'm gonna go check on the yams.
{5822}{5912}No, sweetie. No, not like that.
{5918}{5992}We're not at a barn dance.
{5998}{6085}Fold them like swans.|I showed you at Christmas.
{6090}{6176}Yeah, it all just came|screaming back to me.
{6242}{6321}- So how's the game?|- I have no idea.
{6328}{6381}- What?|- I'm pretending to watch...
{6386}{6438}...so I don't have to help out.
{6464}{6606}I don't believe you!|That is brilliant!
{6618}{6745}- And Monica has no idea?|- No. I just yell stuff at the TV.
{6768}{6841}'Ey! What? 'Ey!
{6876}{6968}- Your team winning?|- Anderson just scored again.
{6974}{7041}There is no Anderson.
{7076}{7146}I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?
{7152}{7256}I can't help you.|I didn't realize this game was on.
{7262}{7331}- You like football?|- Normally, I don't.
{7338}{7429}But, you know, Green Bay is playing.
{7442}{7546}- You like Green Bay?|- It's only my favorite bay.
{7824}{7922}- Happy Thanksgiving.|- Will, I'm so glad that you came.
{7928}{7972}You must've lost...
{7978}{8088}150 pounds. I'll be on one of those|Subway commercials.
{8136}{8241}- A pie!|- It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.
{8248}{8331}- It's no good. Throw it out.|- Meet some people.
{8338}{8408}This is my husband, Chandler.|This is Will.
{8414}{8529}Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand|but I'm really into the game.
{8534}{8646}Plus, it'd be better for my ego|if we didn't stand together.
{8696}{8733}- This is Phoebe.|- Hi.
{8750}{8836}Hey. Wow!
{8896}{8945}Well done.
{8950}{9074}- Wanna give me a hand?|- I can't get over how great you look.
{9080}{9216}- You too. You're so fit.|- I'm watching but I'm not deaf.
{9236}{9342}- I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.|- Great, I love Ross.
{9348}{9416}Good. And Rachel Greene too.
{9494}{9579}- Is there a problem?|- No. It's okay.
{9586}{9679}It's just... God, I hated her.
{9696}{9732}- What?|- I hated her.
{9738}{9814}She was horrible to me in high school.
{9820}{9961}But hey, that was a long time ago.|Might be fun to see her again.
{9968}{10051}Got any cakes or cookies|or something?
{10086}{10157}No, Will! No!
{10162}{10224}It's been a while since we screamed.
{10230}{10302}- Oh, okay. No!|- Come on!
{10308}{10401}Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!
{10488}{10592}What are you doing?|You've got an entire turkey to eat.
{10598}{10684}Let me explain to you how|the human body works.
{10690}{10756}I have to warm up my stomach first.
{10762}{10849}- Eating chips is like stretching.|- Okay.
{10854}{10971}- Tribbianis never get full.|- I'm here to tell you something.
{10978}{11081}You can eat and eat, but nothing|will ever fill that void.
{11124}{11263}- Who the hell is this guy?|- This is Will, from high school.
{11272}{11302}- Will!|- Ross!
{11308}{11449}Hey, you came! Man, you|look incredible! Hot stuff!
{11476}{11550}- Hot stuff?|- It's good to see you, man.
{11556}{11623}Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?
{11638}{11731}- I'm a commodities broker.|- That sounds interesting.
{11736}{11798}- Yeah, it's not.|- Oh.
{11804}{11878}- But I'm rich and thin.|- Oh.
{11884}{11996}I haven't seen you since|Lance Davis' graduation party.
{12002}{12044}That was such a fun night.
{12050}{12150}Would've been good if we had|gotten in, but still fun.
{12156}{12267}We were lame. Do you remember|how into dinosaurs we were?
{12334}{12403}- Yeah.|- So, what do you do now?
{12448}{12509}So how long are you in town?
{12538}{12622}- Hi.|- Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.
{12628}{12663}Rachel Greene.
{12706}{12770}Oh, that's right.|Are you gonna be okay?
{12776}{12922}Oh, I'll be fine. It's just...|God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!
{12972}{13026}High school was a long time ago.
{13032}{13105}Look at her standing there|with those yams.
{13110}{13245}My two greatest enemies: Rachel Greene|and complex carbohydrates.
{13278}{13323}Oh, my God. Who is that?
{13354}{13480}- That's Will, from high school.|- Oh! I do not remember him.
{13486}{13617}Wow, really got that sexy|smoldering thing going on.
{13716}{13808}Oh, my God. Look at the way|he's just staring at me.
{13814}{13877}He's trying to mouth something to me.
{13884}{13970}I hate you!
{13994}{14053}- Okay, dinner's ready!|- Okay!
{14058}{14151}- Solid effort. Solid effort.|- Oh, so who won?
{14156}{14212}- Green Bay.|- Detroit.
{14218}{14278}- What?|- The Lions technically won.
{14284}{14402}But it was a moral victory|for the Green Bay Mermen.
{14474}{14574}Hi! Will, right?|Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.
{14580}{14701}- Oh, I remember you.|- Really? Aren't you sweet?
{14706}{14830}I gotta tell you, I'm having|the hardest time placing you.
{14836}{14893}Hang on! I think I remember you.
{14900}{15030}Did we fool around at|Lance Davis' graduation party?
{15046}{15125}- You are unbelievable.|- Thank you.
{15148}{15272}Rachel? Why don't you sit here?|And Will, you sit way over there.
{15414}{15497}That's it? I can eat that, no problem.
{15502}{15629}- At least give me a challenge.|- This is Chandler's chicken.
{15668}{15742}This is the turkey.
{15766}{15841}Oh. How big is that?
{15846}{15977}- About 19 pounds.|- It's like me when I was born.
{15998}{16125}- Who would like some yams? Will?|- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
{16164}{16234}What? Oh, can we please keep|the chicken...
{16240}{16300}...and the turkey on the other side?
{16306}{16395}- The smell is just...|- Typical.
{16440}{16495}- What?|- I said it was typical.
{16502}{16648}Typical of you. Queen Rachel does|whatever she wants in Rachel-land.
{16754}{16798}Seriously, who is this guy?
{16832}{16898}Sorry, do you have a problem with me?
{16904}{17024}- I don't know. Do I? Do I?|- I think you do.
{17064}{17129}You were mean to him in high school.
{17134}{17246}- You made my life miserable.|- I had no idea. I'm sorry.
{17252}{17340}Well, you should be.|Screw it. Bring on the yams.
{17350}{17388}But you worked so hard.
{17394}{17452}- Yams!|- Okay.
{17518}{17627}I'm real sorry for whatever|I did to you in high school.
{17634}{17702}It wasn't just me. We had a club.
{17708}{17825}- You had a club?|- The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!
{17830}{17918}So you all just joined together|to hate me?
{17924}{18026}- Who else was in this club?|- Me and Ross.
{18134}{18227}No need to point.|She knows who Ross is.
{18392}{18494}- You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?|- Yes, he was.
{18500}{18529}No, no.
{18570}{18711}- So who else was in this club?|- That exchange student from Thailand.
{18716}{18816}But I don't think he knew what it was.
{18822}{18934}We went out for two years|and you never told me?
{18940}{19022}You went out with her? We had a pact.
{19050}{19198}- It's not like it was binding forever.|- It had the word "eternity" in it.
{19218}{19285}Monica? Did you know about this?
{19292}{19390}I didn't. Is that why you used|to lock the bedroom door?
{19396}{19480}- Yeah.|- A little relieved, I gotta say.
{19524}{19636}Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?|I was a stupid kid, okay?
{19642}{19755}- The only reason I joined...|- Cofounded.
{19786}{19869}Cofounded the club, was that|I was in love with you.
{19874}{19968}If you think about it,|the "I Hate Rachel Club"...
{19974}{20045}...was really|the "I Love Rachel Club."
{20052}{20126}But it was really|the "I Hate Rachel Club."
{20132}{20235}So you'd get together|and say mean things about me?
{20242}{20345}- We did a little more than that.|- No, no, no.
{20356}{20390}What else did you do?
{20396}{20495}- We started a rumor.|- What rumor?
{20502}{20597}Come on, Will.|Take off your shirt and tell us.
{20678}{20740}- Ross?|- It was no big deal.
{20746}{20885}We said that... The rumor was that...
{20892}{21020}...you had both male and female|reproductive parts.
{21042}{21116}- What?|- That's right. We said your parents...
{21122}{21256}...decided to raise you as a girl,|but you still had a hint of a penis.
{21262}{21329}- Oh, my God!|- You started that?
{21334}{21442}- You heard that?|- Everyone at our school heard it!
{21448}{21526}You were the hermaphrodite|cheerleader?
{21532}{21578}Oh, no!
{21610}{21713}It makes sense. This is why|Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me.
{21718}{21790}Why Billy would just stay|in this region.
{21796}{21895}Billy's gay now, so that one's|not really our fault.
{21920}{22010}- Why didn't you tell me?|- I thought it might be true.
{22016}{22120}I was afraid that you were gonna cry|and then show it to me.
{22256}{22339}Stop staring! There's nothing there!|It's not true!
{22344}{22420}I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
{22766}{22838}You are my Everest.
{22844}{22948}- You don't have to finish.|- I do. Otherwise, what's next?
{22954}{23079}Today I can't finish a turkey,|but tomorrow I eat half a Power Bar...
{23086}{23163}...wrap it up and put it|in the fridge? No!
{23170}{23293}I gotta change my pants. What was|I thinking? Jeans have no give.
{23366}{23488}Listen to what Sean McMahon|wrote in my yearbook senior year.
{23494}{23612}"Dear Rach, you're such a great|person. " Not girl, "person. "
{23618}{23709}I think you're reading a little|too much into it.
{23716}{23808}"You're a great person.|Sorry about your weenie."
{23898}{24014}You want me to call everyone|and tell them it wasn't true?
{24020}{24080}- Yes.|- Also, tell them I'm skinny now.
{24092}{24154}Oh! Me too!
{24160}{24244}I won't call anybody.|It was a million years ago.
{24250}{24380}I don't care. You told people|that I was half and half!
{24386}{24476}I never did anything to hurt you|in high school.
{24494}{24539}That's not totally true.
{24546}{24575}- What?|- What?
{24580}{24647}You did start that rumor about Ross...
{24654}{24767}...making out with Mrs. Altmann,|our 50-year-old librarian.
{24782}{24833}How did you know that?
{24908}{24990}- It's true?|- No.
{24996}{25109}I saw you going at it|behind the card catalog.
{25114}{25175}Mrs. Altmann? She also made out...
{25182}{25278}...with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek|before he went back to Thailand.
{25306}{25393}In high school you made out|with a 50-year-old woman?
{25400}{25498}- Hey, she didn't look 50!|- Did she look 16?
{25504}{25603}There's a picture of her|in the yearbook actually.
{25616}{25709}- Wow.|- She didn't photograph well!
{25714}{25849}She wasn't familiar with the process,|having sat for oil paintings.
{25886}{25998}How did this happen? Did she lure|you to an early-bird dinner?
{26144}{26278}I was working late in the library.|It was just the two of us.
{26284}{26378}She needed some help|with her word jumble.
{26388}{26478}And one thing led to another.
{26492}{26628}If you must know,|Anita was very gentle and tender.
{26700}{26758}May she rest in peace.
{26792}{26898}- Didn't she walk with a cane?|- Only when it was damp!
{26908}{27028}I can't believe you told people|about this. Everybody knew?
{27034}{27138}- You know what? I'm back in the club!|- Yeah!
{27146}{27190}- I wanna join!|- Phoebe?
{27196}{27300}I never got to be in a club.|I didn't go to high school.
{27306}{27417}But three of us would meet behind|a dumpster to learn French.
{27422}{27494}Fine, you can have|your stupid, little club.
{27500}{27606}But what you did to me is way worse|than what I did to you.
{27612}{27694}- You gave me a teeny weenie.|- Yeah!
{27770}{27850}You're silly.|Even with that rumor you were...
{27856}{27976}...one of the most popular girls.|Everyone wanted to be like you.
{27982}{28070}One girl stuffed her pants|with a Tootsie Roll.
{28076}{28118}Wow.
{28150}{28268}If it weren't for her rumor,|no one would've known who you were.
{28274}{28377}- She put you on the map.|- As a romancer of the elderly.
{28406}{28482}Mrs. Altmann used to be pretty.
{28488}{28584}The eyes did still sparkle.
{28604}{28713}This stuff is so way in the past.|You've been through so much.
{28720}{28809}You got so much more|important stuff going on.
{28814}{28873}Can't you just let this go?
{28932}{29022}- She's right.|- We are having a baby together.
{29028}{29073}Hold on.
{29104}{29169}- You got her pregnant?|- Yeah.
{29180}{29236}- Are you getting married?|- No.
{29242}{29354}So you knocked her up but you're|not gonna marry her. Dude.
{29426}{29503}- Anybody?|- Okay.
{29608}{29672}It's exactly how I imagined|it would be.
{29738}{29803}All right, where's that turkey?
{29916}{30053}- Those are my maternity pants!|- No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!
{30222}{30299}Well, that's it. I'm done.
{30358}{30407}Here come the meat sweats.
{30514}{30581}Well, Joey, we're all|very proud of you.
{30586}{30699}I believe we can expect a call|from the president any moment now.
{30706}{30810}- Anything we can do?|- Just nobody press on my stomach.
{30816}{30888}You can keep those pants, by the way.
{30918}{31015}What you got there?|What is that, pie?
{31020}{31120}- You want some?|- Just cut me a little sliver.
{31170}{31223}Little bigger.
{31248}{31288}Little bigger.
{31294}{31368}What are you afraid of?|Cut me a real piece!

{187}{273}New haircut? Necklace? Dress?
{279}{335}Boots? Boots!
{369}{482}They're a little more than I usually|spend on boots or rent.
{493}{551}- Oh, my God.|- I know.
{557}{688}- I'll miss being able to buy food.|- They just looked so good.
{693}{734}The saleswoman was like:

{925}{1058}- Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.|- They're mine!
{1073}{1215}- Too bad we'll have to return them.|- Return them? They're gonna hear you.

{2621}{2720}And I'm gonna play with you|all the time.
{2725}{2820}How can you let him talk|to your crotch like that?
{2873}{2970}- He's talking to the baby.|- Oh! Okay.
{3009}{3095}When he said, "I can't wait|for your first words"...
{3101}{3155}...I thought, "There's a trick."
{3199}{3275}I gotta go, you guys.|I'll see you later.
{3281}{3330}- Okay. Bye.|- Bye.
{3361}{3489}Can you do me a favor? My sister|knows you work at Ralph Lauren...
{3493}{3576}I am not sending|more clothes to prison.
{3581}{3633}- It is a waste.|- Not her.
{3639}{3724}My youngest sister Dina|is interested in fashion.
{3729}{3808}She wants to talk|to someone successful.
{3813}{3906}- I'll talk to my supervisor.|- She wants to talk to you.

{4037}{4119}- Would you meet with her?|- Have her come by.
{4125}{4243}You'll love her. She's the smartest|of all the Tribbiani children.

{4557}{4708}You knew and said nothing? With all|the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?
{4713}{4850}Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.|Can I talk about fossils?
{4971}{5041}"Sting's son, 7." There's a picture.
{5047}{5165}What are you reading, "The Kidnapper's|Guide to Manhattan Schools"?
{5171}{5251}It's an article about|the city's best schools.
{5257}{5354}- So how well do you know Sting?|- I haven't met him.
{5359}{5486}That's too bad. I wanna go to his|concert Friday, but it's sold out.
{5491}{5578}I know! Why don't you|meet him and get tickets.
{5583}{5644}If you get two, I'll take you.
{5649}{5709}Maybe he'll be there tomorrow.
{5715}{5827}There you go. You're so lucky.|You might meet Sting tomorrow.
{5833}{5893}That's why you have kids.
{6055}{6089}- Hey, guys.|- Hey.
{6095}{6177}Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.
{6205}{6305}See? I'm getting a lot of use|out of them already.
{6311}{6379}You can wear them|with dresses, skirts...
{6385}{6496}Wear them with shorts on the corner|and earn money to pay for them.
{6519}{6619}- Wow, they're beautiful.|- They hurt so much.
{6627}{6677}- What?|- The guy who made these...
{6683}{6757}...hates feet|and wants to see them die.
{6763}{6862}Give them to me.|I haven't felt my feet in years.
{6867}{6977}I can't. I told Chandler|I'd wear them all the time.
{6983}{7061}- Then return them.|- I can't do that either.
{7067}{7189}The soles are scuffed up, and the|insides are filled with my blood.
{7237}{7335}Hey, I just picked up Ben|from school.
{7343}{7424}I don't think you did|a very thorough job.
{7429}{7482}I dropped him off at Carol's.
{7487}{7555}Anyway, I'm not gonna|get those tickets.
{7561}{7591}Oh, no. Why not?
{7597}{7688}It turns out Ben and Sting's son|do not get along.
{7693}{7765}- How come?|- Sting's son made fun...
{7771}{7850}...of Ben's moms being "lesbenims."
{7869}{7987}If they don't get along, smooth|things over. Make them be friends.
{7993}{8077}- You can't force kids to be friends.|- Sure you can.
{8083}{8164}Give them some blocks.|Put them in a playpen.
{8169}{8265}- Playpen? Ben's 7.|- Your kid is 7?
{8275}{8324}He's really small.
{8361}{8454}- Please get the tickets.|- I just can't do it.
{8459}{8550}- Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.|- What?
{8555}{8635}{y:i}Ross can
{8681}{8713}Look, I'm sorry...
{8719}{8795}{y:i}Ross can
{8843}{8927}- Phoebe?|{y:i}- Ross can get me the tickets
{8933}{9030}{y:i}Ross can get me the tickets
{9143}{9211}Here she is: Future fashion superstar.
{9217}{9311}- Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...|- My little sister Dina.
{9317}{9366}Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.
{9371}{9493}- Thanks so much for meeting with me.|- This is so exciting for her.
{9499}{9630}Well, I'll let you two "fashists"|get down to business.
{9653}{9704}Okay. All right, Dina.
{9709}{9801}Let's talk about the different|areas of fashion...
{9807}{9857}...you could get involved in.
{9863}{9966}There's design. But you may|need another degree for that.
{9971}{10094}- Sales is great. You get to travel.|- I don't care about fashion.
{10099}{10180}I'm pregnant. You are too.|You gotta help me.
{10219}{10275}Then there's marketing.
{10827}{10920}- What's wrong?|- Nothing. I just was yawning.
{10947}{11016}Don't forget|my office party's tonight.
{11021}{11076}We don't have to go, do we?
{11081}{11226}I know that you don't like my parties,|but you can wear your new boots.
{11231}{11319}See? Every cloud has|a supple leather lining.
{11351}{11436}- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.|- Why not?
{11441}{11544}Your bosses will think|they pay you too much money.
{11549}{11635}Or your assistant will see them|and want a raise.
{11651}{11737}Do you think I work|at a boot-pricing company?
{11743}{11828}I picked out this outfit|the boots don't go with.
{11833}{11948}You said those boots go|with skirts, dresses and pants.
{11953}{12015}Fine, I'll wear the boots.
{12021}{12150}In fact, I'll go into my room|right now and try the outfit on.
{12245}{12305}Christmas party in my boots!
{12427}{12496}I can't go in there. I can't tell him.
{12501}{12605}It's gonna be okay.|He's been incredibly supportive of me.
{12611}{12713}And if he gets upset,|that's what the meatball sub is for.
{12729}{12771}- Thank you.|- Okay.
{12803}{12887}Hey! It's my fashion girls.
{12943}{13011}- What's wrong?|- Why don't you sit down?
{13017}{13096}Dina has something|she wants to tell you.
{13101}{13206}What's going on?|Is it Mom? Is she sick?
{13213}{13257}Is it Dad's heart?
{13263}{13320}Is that a sandwich?
{13371}{13455}- Mom and Dad are fine.|- Is that a sandwich?!
{13491}{13630}Joey, there's something|that you should know. Dina?
{13663}{13741}- I'm pregnant.|- What?
{13747}{13799}Now. Give him the sandwich!
{13823}{13921}Obviously, this is a mistake.|You can't be pregnant.
{13927}{13992}You have to have sex to get pregnant.
{13997}{14110}Joe, I tried to wait until|I was 25, like you did.
{14117}{14151}What? Dina...
{14237}{14351}I can't believe this. You're|the good one who went to college!
{14357}{14500}- Both years! Who did this to you?|- Bobby Corso. He's a real nice guy.
{14507}{14651}- I like him a lot. He's real funny.|- You got pregnant for "funny"?
{14657}{14754}Dina, if he's funny, laugh!
{14821}{14892}- I'll be back in a while. Stay here!|- Why?
{14897}{14978}I can't look at you right now.
{15027}{15108}- Wow.|- I know.
{15439}{15554}- Oh, there you are, Ben.|- Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
{15559}{15645}I heard you have a problem|with one of the boys.
{15651}{15757}I thought I'd sit you both down|and make it all okay.
{15763}{15860}Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.
{15877}{15943}Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.
{15949}{16046}Sometimes people may seem|like jerks on the outside...
{16051}{16114}...but they have famous fathers.
{16127}{16260}- My friend Doug is waiting for me.|- Him, you're friends with.
{16387}{16534}- Can I help you with something?|- Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.
{16539}{16605}- Are you with a student?|- I'm with Ben.
{16611}{16734}- Are you one of Ben's mothers?|- I am one of Ben's mothers.
{16739}{16795}I'm a lesbian.
{16801}{16892}It was difficult coming out|to my parents.
{16897}{16993}Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.|I'm a new teacher here.
{16999}{17114}- I've only met your partner, Carol.|- That would make me Susan.
{17119}{17262}Are you looking for Jack's parents|to discuss his problems with Ben?
{17267}{17356}I think the parents|should sit down together.
{17361}{17430}Yeah, let's do that!
{17449}{17482}That sounds good.
{17487}{17599}We should sit down and talk.|Me, Carol and the Stings.
{17605}{17733}- How will I get in touch with them?|- Their number's on the contact sheet.
{17737}{17855}Could I get a copy of that?|Carol threw it out. She lost ours.
{17861}{17983}She's such a scatterbrain.|But, man, what a hot piece of ass.
{18127}{18232}- That party wasn't bad.|- I didn't know there'd be dancing.
{18237}{18286}That was a fun surprise.
{18291}{18391}- I don't see a cab. We should walk.|- No, we can't walk.
{18397}{18467}It's 15 blocks to the subway.|Let's go.
{18473}{18598}Do you think we can get to the subway|if we climb through that manhole?
{18603}{18676}- What's going on?|- I can't walk, okay?
{18681}{18754}- These boots were a huge mistake.|- What?
{18759}{18881}You were right. I never should've|bought them. They're killing me.
{18887}{18985}So I was right. This is what|it feels like to be right.
{19013}{19080}It's oddly unsettling.
{19085}{19156}How will we get home?|A piggyback ride?
{19165}{19204}- Hop on.|- Okay, wait.
{19209}{19280}Let me just get my boots off first.
{19413}{19460}Oh, God.
{19567}{19680}I know you're in pain right now,|but I'm a little turned on.
{19777}{19895}Do you worry that you'll be walking|and your baby will slip out?
{19945}{20021}What college was that, Dina?
{20057}{20109}Oh, my God. Bobby?
{20115}{20206}Hi, Dina. Good to see you.
{20211}{20310}- Joey, what are you doing?|- Just what needs to be done.
{20325}{20429}- Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...|- This is crazy.
{20435}{20512}Don't interrupt me|when I'm talking to God!
{20517}{20603}- Where were we? Do you take this man...|- No!
{20609}{20656}- You'll take him.|- I won't!
{20661}{20706}- You don't get a say.|- I do.
{20711}{20840}- I heard "I do." We're halfway there.|- All right, Joey, that is enough!
{20845}{20927}As moving as this is,|this is not legal.
{20933}{21086}They don't have a marriage license or|witnesses, and the groom has one shoe.
{21091}{21188}Yeah, he took the other one off|and hit me with it.
{21193}{21223}What am I to do?
{21229}{21324}They are adults and can make|their own decisions.
{21329}{21435}No, they can't. They were|stupid enough to get knocked up!
{21471}{21554}Contraceptives are not|always effective. Right?
{21571}{21720}- Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.|- Come on, kids, a little help here!
{21823}{21906}Wow! This place is incredible!
{21959}{22015}Sting's pen...
{22021}{22095}...that he gave to Phoebe.
{22199}{22295}Come on, secret passageway.
{22337}{22390}- Hi.|- Hi.
{22397}{22464}I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
{22469}{22572}- Why else would I be here?|- Why don't you sit down?
{22577}{22716}They haven't been getting along.|I'm sure there are two sides to this.
{22721}{22809}But all I've heard|is that Ben's a "poo-poo-head."
{22815}{22887}Won't Jack's father be joining us?
{22893}{22975}I'm sorry.|Jack's father's not available.
{22981}{23091}Then, could we reschedule|for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?
{23097}{23159}Oh, no, my husband's in concert.
{23165}{23305}Concert. Yeah.|That just put us in quite a pickle.
{23311}{23426}I'm busy before and after|the concert, and he's busy during.
{23431}{23527}So you and I should talk about|Jack and Ben right now.
{23533}{23592}Unless... Unless...
{23597}{23692}Okay, I would be willing|to go to the concert...
{23697}{23771}...all the while thinking|about the children.
{23777}{23886}- Are you here for tickets?|- Thank you. Four would be great.
{23891}{24019}I'm not giving tickets to someone|who'd use their son like this.
{24025}{24103}Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.
{24109}{24182}I've pressed a button|triggering an alarm.
{24187}{24293}- Any minute the police will be here.|- The Police? Here?
{24299}{24350}A reunion?
{24517}{24621}Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
{24627}{24750}- Oh, wait! Stop, stop, stop!|- Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?
{24773}{24848}My boots in tan!|Can I see the price?
{24853}{24961}I can see it from right here.|It'll cost you one husband.
{24967}{25085}I can walk the rest of the way now.|Just give me my boots.
{25103}{25186}- I don't have your boots.|- Where are they?
{25191}{25315}Why don't you check in one|of my saddlebags while I chew on hay?
{25333}{25425}Okay. My God, we gotta go back|and get them!
{25431}{25506}Are you ever gonna|wear the boots again?
{25511}{25658}I'll never wear them again. I just|didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
{25663}{25730}You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
{25735}{25848}- Okay. All right.|- Okay.
{25855}{25932}Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!
{26003}{26120}Just because they're not getting|married doesn't mean it's a disaster.
{26125}{26237}- Maybe they have a plan.|- Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.
{26243}{26335}What's the future look like|for Dina and Bobby?
{26365}{26442}I really have high hopes for my band.
{26471}{26553}- You were right. He is funny.|- Now wait a minute.
{26559}{26672}I bet when you told people you wanted|to be an actor they laughed.
{26677}{26738}Tell us a bit about your band.
{26743}{26880}It's just me and my pal Rooster.|The band's name is Numbnuts.
{26949}{26979}Really?
{27019}{27097}If you're having a baby,|you should be married.
{27103}{27225}Even if it is to Bobby.|Dude, that's not a compliment.
{27231}{27332}- I knew you wouldn't be supportive.|- What are you gonna do?
{27337}{27417}Have the baby and raise it|without a husband?
{27423}{27512}You can't be a single mother!|You'll ruin your life!
{27517}{27617}- Am I ruining my life?|- No, it's different for you.
{27623}{27731}You're not some kid|who doesn't know what she's doing.
{27737}{27850}- Excuse me?|- One pregnant woman at a time, please!
{27883}{28006}- I just want you to be okay.|- By forcing her to marry?
{28011}{28061}Maybe.
{28101}{28203}Yeah. So, what kind of music|does Numbnuts...
{28209}{28266}Ah, forget it! I can't!
{28271}{28410}I am scared to death about this. But I|can do it. I just need some help.
{28415}{28507}- Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.|- You bet.
{28513}{28632}To answer your earlier question,|we're straight up gangster rap.
{28723}{28812}Rachel's told me how easy|you've made this on her.
{28817}{28958}- Why can't you do that for me?|- Because you're my baby sister!
{28963}{29082}And you're my big brother,|my favorite guy in the whole world.
{29087}{29220}I'm not even scared to tell Mom|and Dad. I was scared of telling you.
{29237}{29307}I'd be scared of them, but all right.
{29313}{29425}I can't stand having this baby|with you mad at me.
{29431}{29495}I want him to have his uncle.
{29503}{29585}Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
{29613}{29705}Of course he's gonna have|his Uncle Joey.
{29727}{29867}We'll be all right. Even if we're not|married, this baby will be so loved.
{29873}{29952}- And not just by us.|- That's right.
{29959}{30020}By his uncle too.
{30027}{30090}And by you.
{30161}{30286}Bobby, come over here and let them|have a little moment, okay?
{30379}{30435}Come here.
{30461}{30530}No, seriously, what's wrong with you?
{30649}{30744}You're gonna love me so much.|I got Sting tickets!
{30749}{30838}Oh, my God, I do love you!|How did you do it?
{30843}{30886}Well, let's just say:
{30893}{30970}{y:i}Ross can
{31007}{31064}- Where are the seats?|- Balcony.
{31069}{31126}Is that more than 50 yards away...
{31131}{31219}...from Sting, his wife|or a member of his family?
{31225}{31305}- Yeah.|- Then that's not breaking the law!

{40}{140}Phoebe. Look at that guy|by the window. Wow!
{146}{238}He's awfully short.|And I think he's talking to himself.
{244}{338}And to be completely honest,|he's not that good in bed.
{350}{453}What is wrong with me lately?|It's like, every guy I see.
{459}{506}That guy, for example.
{513}{584}That's not someone|I would be attracted to.
{591}{754}But right now, all I want to do is rip|off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
{759}{860}Wait! This is about the fourth month|of your pregnancy.
{866}{961}This is normal.|Your hormones start going crazy.
{967}{1044}- Really? This has happened to you?|- Absolutely!
{1051}{1104}And I was carrying triplets.
{1111}{1214}So in medical terms,|I was thrice as randy.
{1220}{1284}This explains so much!
{1290}{1405}Last weekend, I went from store|to store, sitting on Santas' laps.
{1439}{1583}Yeah, I remember trying to steal a|cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield.
{1619}{1742}I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow. Maybe|she can give me a pill or something.
{1748}{1833}Yeah, that's what you need.|A good pill.

{2821}{2883}- I got our pictures developed.|- Great.
{2890}{2954}Want to see pictures of us skating?
{2995}{3128}Ordinarily, I would love to,|but I am just swamped right now.
{3216}{3303}Where are the ones|that pretzel vendor took of us?
{3310}{3368}Oh, yeah.|Probably at the end.
{3375}{3474}Oh, my God! All he took were pictures|of my breasts.
{3479}{3543}I'm missing picture time!
{3643}{3707}You know, she has a face, Ross.
{3735}{3843}- Okay, here's a good one of us.|- That is a good one!
{3850}{3923}It looks like a holiday card.|With the tree...
{3929}{3985}...and the skaters and the snow.
{3992}{4061}I want to send out cards,|but I never do.
{4068}{4138}Do you want|to send this one out together?
{4240}{4321}Together? Like, to people?
{4327}{4433}Yeah. "Happy Holidays, from Mona|and Ross. " lt'll be cute, okay?
{4440}{4484}Okay.
{4491}{4556}I gotta go to work. Call me later?
{4563}{4613}- Bye, guys.|- Bye.
{4676}{4746}Congratulations! You just got married!
{4771}{4816}Can you believe that?
{4822}{4890}What's the big deal|about a holiday card?
{4896}{4978}Married couples and families|send out cards.
{4985}{5103}People who just started dating|don't send out cards. Is she crazy?
{5110}{5179}That's your wife you're talking about!
{5205}{5273}Bing!|And the Bingette!
{5291}{5353}- You remember my boss, Doug.|- Yes. Hi.
{5360}{5466}Good news! The divorce is final.|I signed the papers this a.m.
{5472}{5528}You and Kara divorced?|I'm sorry.
{5534}{5633}Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out|of that bear trap.
{5656}{5752}- Congratulations to you guys.|- No leg-chewing for us.
{5758}{5819}Well, give it time.
{5826}{5923}The divorce, the marriage,|we got a lot to celebrate.
{5929}{5994}We should all go out|to dinner tomorrow.
{6001}{6063}I can't think|of anything we're doing.
{6069}{6137}Why can't I think of anything?
{6143}{6204}Tomorrow.|I'll be out of court by 6.
{6211}{6335}They keep throwing sexual harassment|cases at me, and I knock them out!
{6341}{6392}Okay, see you tomorrow.
{6398}{6530}We're not seeing him tomorrow. I can't|spend another evening with that man.
{6536}{6600}Remember how he behaved|at our wedding?
{6606}{6658}Because he wasn't invited.
{6664}{6725}He misbehaved|at our engagement party.
{6731}{6859}Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through|an ice sculpture, doesn't it?
{6981}{7071}Hi! I went by the photo shop.|Take a look.
{7077}{7168}Here is a mockup of our card.|What do you think?
{7228}{7265}Looks great.
{7274}{7359}Do you think it should say,|"Love, Ross and Mona"?
{7366}{7476}Well, we haven't said that|to each other yet...
{7483}{7558}...but I guess it's okay|to say it to others.
{7565}{7673}- How many did you want? I'll get 100.|- A hundred?
{7716}{7794}Well, I guess I'll take...
{7801}{7848}Mona?
{7874}{7995}I'm not sure|about the whole card thing.
{8001}{8036}Really? Why not?
{8056}{8149}Sending out a holiday card together?
{8156}{8267}I just don't know|if we're really quite there yet.
{8290}{8366}I didn't think of it that way.|You're right.
{8477}{8528}- Can I ask you something?|- Yes.
{8535}{8578}Where are we?
{8624}{8748}You know, where are we?|Where is this relationship going?
{8875}{8983}I love spending time with you.|I just hope we're moving forward.
{8989}{9068}We should talk about that,|don't you think?
{9250}{9303}Let's do the card!
{9335}{9432}- What?|- The card! I think we're there!
{9438}{9524}Okay. But I still think|we should have this talk.
{9530}{9573}Really?
{9580}{9651}Even with the card?
{9774}{9904}Dr. Long can't be here today,|so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
{9910}{9989}Okay.|Can I ask you a question?
{9996}{10104}Was it me, or was the guy|who took my blood sample really cute?
{10111}{10228}You know who I'm talking about?|Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?
{10258}{10373}- Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.|- Yes, you are.
{10404}{10442}So, how's it going?
{10448}{10534}Really, really good.|But enough about me! Come on.
{10541}{10622}Where are you from?|What do you do?
{10635}{10706}- I'm a doctor.|- Right. I meant...
{10712}{10784}...in your spare time.|Do you cook? Ski?
{10791}{10867}Or hang out with your wife,|or girlfriend?
{10873}{10951}I have no wife or girlfriend,|but I do ski.
{10957}{11058}I love to ski!|How amazing is this?
{11076}{11183}- Are you experiencing any discomfort?|- No, I'm very comfortable.
{11189}{11273}- Any painful gas?|- No!
{11301}{11406}Dr. Schiff!|What kind of question is that?
{11424}{11495}Would you like|to lie down on the table?
{11501}{11588}Would you like me|to lie down on the table?
{11595}{11703}- Is there something going on here?|- Do you feel it too?
{11786}{11874}- Hi.|- How did your doctor's appointment go?
{11881}{11978}Let's see,|they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.
{11984}{12084}In the middle of the exam,|I put my pinkie in his dimple.
{12091}{12168}- Oh, my God!|- Why did you do that?
{12174}{12267}Remember my problem during|my fourth month of pregnancy?
{12273}{12339}Oh, yeah!|The Evander Holyfield phase.
{12346}{12445}Man! You were so hard up,|you practically came on to me.
{12451}{12504}You wish.
{12511}{12586}I could have had you|if I wanted you.
{12593}{12655}Oh, yeah? Come and get it.
{12662}{12733}Okay, even this is turning me on.
{12788}{12884}Ross! How's it going|with you and Mona?
{12891}{12958}Are you guys still together?
{12969}{13079}Yeah, we're moving forward.|You'll be getting our card.
{13085}{13134}You're doing a holiday card?
{13141}{13272}Not just a card. She wants to talk|about where the relationship is going.
{13278}{13329}Women!
{13336}{13431}I know! Why do you guys need|to have this conversation?
{13437}{13524}No man would ask a woman,|"So where is this going?"
{13530}{13571}Ross, you asked me that.
{13577}{13699}You were a closed book, okay?|I'm not a mind reader!
{13706}{13828}Besides, I hate those conversations.|I'm horrible at them. Really.
{13835}{13899}Maybe I need some kind of a gesture...
{13906}{13989}...that says we're moving forward|without talking.
{13995}{14054}Like asking her|to move in with you?
{14061}{14106}Smaller than that.
{14117}{14197}- Making her a mix tape?|- Bigger than that.
{14203}{14323}- Give her a key to your apartment.|- We were closer with the mix tape.
{14330}{14387}Have you said, "I love you"?
{14393}{14464}I don't think I'm quite there yet.
{14471}{14554}But I could say,|"I love spending time with you."
{14560}{14621}- We hate that.|- It's a slap in the face.
{14627}{14744}Forget it. You know what?|I'll just have the conversation.
{14751}{14879}I'll just say I like things the way|they are, and hope for the best.
{14886}{14929}What do you think, Rach?
{14936}{15013}I think if it was|a little colder in here...
{15019}{15108}...I could see your nipples|through that sweater.
{15189}{15274}Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.
{15280}{15341}We can't do it. Monica has to work.
{15347}{15409}My ex-wife didn't work.
{15416}{15498}Unless you call turning|into her mother "work."
{15526}{15586}Fine. Tomorrow night then.
{15592}{15681}- Tomorrow's no good for her, either.|- Why not?
{15710}{15759}It's the semifinals...
{15766}{15867}...of her bocce ball tournament.
{15890}{16038}What's going on, Bing? Does your wife|have a problem with me or something?
{16044}{16106}Well, now you're just talking crazy.
{16112}{16178}Then why can't we all go out together?
{16186}{16259}Because we split up.
{16266}{16328}Monica and I split up.
{16334}{16370}Hold me.
{16409}{16514}Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say|I'm altogether surprised.
{16521}{16644}I saw the way she looked at you,|and there was no love there.
{16668}{16764}And the way she looked at me,|pure lust.
{16770}{16888}What would really help me through|this tough time is choking someone.
{16896}{16973}Bing, my boy,|we're gonna get you over this.
{16980}{17066}Here's the plan:|We're going to a strip club!
{17072}{17143}Oh, no!|Monica would freak.
{17153}{17228}But to hell with that bitch!
{17294}{17348}Here we go.
{17369}{17520}Mona, it's time we had a conversation|about where things are with us.
{17526}{17613}Yeah, I think I suggested that.
{17629}{17681}We are so...
{17808}{17943}Well, I really like you.|And I love hanging out with you.
{17950}{18063}And I'm having a lot of fun.
{18161}{18198}Okay.
{18204}{18318}There's no point in spending time|with someone if it's just fun.
{18325}{18424}It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
{18430}{18503}So where is it going?
{18628}{18729}That's the real question.
{18788}{18868}And the answer is...
{18874}{18958}...it's going somewhere...
{18965}{19018}...fun.
{19044}{19169}I know what you're thinking.|Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.
{19176}{19258}But you're not getting any younger.
{19264}{19328}No! I mean, not you.|Not you.
{19334}{19403}You are getting younger!
{19410}{19553}You're getting younger by the second.|What's your secret?
{19595}{19753}- I'm sorry, so where are we?|- Well, to sum up...
{19821}{19949}...we're having fun.|You look young.
{20040}{20109}- Okay...|- But that's not enough.
{20177}{20233}So...
{20288}{20394}...here's a key to my apartment.
{20400}{20471}- Really?|- Really.
{20512}{20573}You don't think this is too fast?
{20713}{20777}You gave her a key|to your apartment?
{20782}{20894}Not just a key.|I gave her the only key!
{20922}{21029}I am now a homeless person|in a very serious relationship!
{21091}{21210}- Ross, how did the conversation go?|- Great. I live on the street.
{21216}{21273}Where?
{21300}{21353}- Hi.|- Okay, Monica, Rachel...
{21359}{21440}...this is my friend Roger.|- Hi, Roger.
{21446}{21525}I'll get us some drinks.|Could you help me?
{21531}{21599}Yeah, okay.
{21699}{21783}He's here to have sex with you.
{21880}{21927}- What?|- You're welcome.
{21956}{22041}- Phoebe, no!|- It's okay. He's a virgin.
{22154}{22268}Rachel, I was talking to this guy.|I think he'll have sex with you.
{22292}{22334}Let's leave them alone.
{22341}{22476}No! I don't care what my hormones are|doing! I won't do it with some guy!
{22485}{22609}Fine! Then you tell Roger, because|he was really looking forward to this!
{22991}{23088}Bing! Look at those twin sisters|dancing together.
{23110}{23188}Let me buy you a lap dance|with those girls.
{23194}{23309}That's all right, sir.|And that's just one girl.
{23316}{23399}- Bing, what's this?|- It's a hand.
{23406}{23459}You use it as a drink holder.
{23466}{23587}It's a wedding ring. Get rid of it.|We'll throw it in the East River!
{23593}{23626}- No!|- Yes!
{23632}{23778}I did it, and I felt a lot better! You|might even hit a seagull in the head.
{23798}{23892}Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch|of extra keys.
{23898}{23999}Apparently, I give them away|for no reason at all.
{24035}{24118}Ross, what's going on?|You're changing the lock?
{24124}{24153}No.
{24160}{24207}That guy is.
{24217}{24339}You give me a key to your apartment,|and then you change the lock?
{24353}{24408}Good luck, buddy.
{24473}{24608}I thought we were moving forward. Now|you're sending me these mixed signals.
{24615}{24683}What are you trying to tell me?
{24695}{24773}I'm trying to tell you...
{24793}{24860}...I made you a mix tape.
{24894}{24965}- What?|- I love you.
{25091}{25163}And I love spending time with you.
{25317}{25418}- Hi, honey, I'm home.|- From the tequila factory?
{25441}{25558}To avoid going to dinner with Doug,|I told him you and I split up.
{25564}{25634}So he took me|to these sleazy strip clubs.
{25641}{25754}When I wouldn't give him my wedding|ring, he threw a can at a bird.
{25770}{25860}Come here.|I can breathe through my mouth.
{25867}{25938}- Sweetie.|- You know what the worst part was?
{25945}{26014}I saw what my life would be|without you.
{26021}{26111}It was like "It's a Wonderful Life"|with lap dances.
{26159}{26229}Please promise|that you'll never leave me...
{26236}{26348}...that we'll grow old together,|and be with each other always.
{26361}{26418}I promise.
{26434}{26533}How about we send out|a holiday card together this year?
{26539}{26603}I don't know if we're there yet.
{26687}{26773}I'd like to order a pizza.|Can I ask you a question?
{26779}{26910}Is the cute blond guy delivering|tonight? Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."
{26916}{26977}- I'll call you back.|- Who was that?
{26983}{27084}- It's just the pizza place.|- You hung up on the pizza place?
{27090}{27160}I don't hang up on your friends.
{27166}{27249}- Sorry, I'm just having a rough day.|- What's wrong?
{27256}{27354}- You don't want to hear about it.|- Then why did I ask?
{27361}{27478}Okay, this is embarrassing. Lately,|with this whole pregnancy thing...
{27485}{27568}...I'm just finding myself...
{27575}{27643}How do I put this?
{27650}{27700}Erotically charged.
{27729}{27817}Is that college talk for "horny"?
{27834}{27958}Yeah. I have all of these feelings,|and I don't know what to do.
{27964}{28063}I can't date a normal person.|I don't need a relationship.
{28070}{28161}All I really want is one great night!|Just sex.
{28168}{28229}No strings attached.|No relationship.
{28236}{28344}With someone I feel comfortable with,|and who knows what to do.
{28351}{28503}For just one great night.|I mean, is that really so hard...
{28514}{28572}...to find?
{28689}{28736}So how was your day?
{28742}{28843}Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.
{28958}{29031}I gotta get up early,|and it's almost 7:00.
{29037}{29094}- I gotta go to my room.|- Good night!
{29101}{29148}Good night!
{29214}{29275}- I can't do it!|- I didn't ask you to!
{29281}{29358}- You're Rachel! My friend!|- You're Joey!
{29391}{29467}Plus, it would be wrong,|and weird and bad!
{29473}{29566}So bad!|But I didn't ask you to do anything!
{29572}{29623}I know!
{29825}{29862}- You wanna do it?|- No!
{29867}{29944}- I'm just testing you!|- No more of this talk!
{29951}{30024}- This talk never happened!|- Good night!
{30031}{30078}Good night!
{30225}{30289}Get back in there!
{30449}{30546}Listen, I'm sorry about|that whole thing with Roger.
{30551}{30648}It really wasn't right.|And I want to make it up to you.
{30655}{30747}So I brought you something|I think you'll really enjoy.
{30928}{31058}Now this is just a loan, okay?|I'm gonna want him back.
{31084}{31132}I'm gonna go now.
{31237}{31328}I'm sorry.|I thought I could do it, and I can't.

{45}{106}Hey, I got you a present!
{111}{168}Oh, my, where did you hide it?
{174}{262}I ordered it for your wedding|and it's finally here!
{267}{328}You didn't have to get us anything...
{334}{402}I love it! It's huge! Let's open it!
{467}{563}- It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!|- Oh, my God!
{568}{618}I didn't know where to put it.
{623}{713}- We can put it in the guest bedroom.|- Yeah, okay.
{811}{847}I kind of like it here.
{852}{880}Do you like it?
{886}{980}I practically spent my|entire childhood at the arcade.
{986}{1065}- This was my second favorite.|- What's your first?
{1070}{1155}- I don't remember the name.|- Well, what did it do?
{1160}{1283}You'd put a quarter in,|pull some handles and win a candy bar.
{1289}{1343}A vending machine?
{1348}{1438}Don't feel bad for me.|I won every time!

{2367}{2422}I'm so glad you guys are here.
{2428}{2513}Guess what happened|in the paleontology department.
{2518}{2608}Do you think he saw us,|or can we still slip out?
{2614}{2714}Professor Newman, the department head,|is retiring, so...
{2719}{2840}- They made you head of the department!|- I'm teaching his advanced class!
{2866}{2937}Why didn't I get head|of the department?
{2960}{3075}Hey, Rach, I got a big date.|Do you know a good restaurant?
{3097}{3202}Paul's Cafe. It's got great food|and it's really romantic.
{3207}{3239}Great, thanks.
{3244}{3328}Then take her to the|Four Seasons for drinks.
{3344}{3423}Or go downtown|and listen to some jazz.
{3428}{3489}Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!
{3495}{3581}You sure are naming|a lot of ways to postpone sex.
{3608}{3707}I miss dating. Dressing up,|going to a fancy restaurant.
{3724}{3830}I won't be able to do that for so long.|And it's so much fun.
{3840}{3946}Not that sitting around|worrying about giving birth isn't fun.
{3982}{4070}Hey, you know what?|Why don't I take you out?
{4078}{4149}You don't want to date|a pregnant lady.
{4155}{4221}Yes, I do. We're gonna|have a good time.
{4227}{4334}I'll take your mind off of childbirth,|and C-sections...
{4339}{4394}...and baby heads stretching out...
{4399}{4438}Okay, I'll go with you.
{4443}{4502}- It will be fun.|- All right.
{4507}{4552}No, no! Yes!
{4585}{4624}Would you look at that.
{4630}{4708}I knocked off all your top scores.|How sad.
{4713}{4743}Okay, I'm next.
{4750}{4829}Don't start another game.|I'm next! Phoebe?
{4835}{4929}Sorry, I couldn't hear you|over all the winning.
{4938}{5022}- Phoebe's hogging the game.|- It's a stupid game.
{5028}{5098}You think it's stupid because|you suck.
{5115}{5174}I don't suck. It sucks.
{5180}{5233}You suck.
{5283}{5385}If this game is gonna cause problems,|I should keep it.
{5390}{5458}No, I love it. It is a great present.
{5463}{5562}Why don't you go home and wait|for the "Thank You" card?
{5567}{5694}- Why do you want to play this game?|- It doesn't spit out a Clark Bar.
{5708}{5787}Okay. Phoebe, that's it.|Out of the chair.
{5955}{6024}Joey, could you get that?
{6328}{6385}I thought you were in your room.
{6390}{6472}I'm picking you up for our date.|For you.
{6512}{6594}Lilies. They're my favorite.|Thank you.
{6600}{6671}And a brownie.
{6701}{6754}Well, half a brownie.
{6759}{6811}Actually, it's just a bag.
{6816}{6931}It's a long walk from the flower shop|and I felt faint, so...
{6947}{7056}This is so great! I actually feel|like I'm on a real date.
{7062}{7185}But I have morning sickness and|I have on underwear that goes up to...
{7191}{7227}...there.
{7232}{7299}Hey, come on. This is a real date.
{7305}{7362}So nice place you got here.
{7384}{7467}Foosball. Pizza box.
{7473}{7567}Oh, a subscription to "Playboy."|My kind of woman.
{7573}{7620}That's my roommate's.
{7625}{7715}I'd like to meet him.|He sounds like a standup guy.
{7721}{7821}He's protective of me,|so you'd better watch yourself.
{7826}{7894}Your roommate, is he good-looking?
{7944}{8021}Must be tough to keep your hands|off him.
{8033}{8078}I'm pretty sure he's gay.
{8100}{8202}No! No, he's not! Why are you trying|to ruin the game?
{8244}{8334}Which brings us back|to Greely's Theory of Dominance.
{8347}{8387}That's it for today.
{8398}{8475}Does anyone know where|the Freeman Building is?
{8480}{8535}It's the new building on Avenue A.
{8540}{8637}That's across town.|I'm teaching there in 10 minutes.
{8642}{8694}Dude, that's not gonna happen.
{8771}{8811}Move it! Move it!
{8817}{8876}Hey! I'm the teacher!
{9201}{9243}Hello.
{9337}{9443}Sorry I'm a little late.|Whoa, a lot late.
{9459}{9538}Well, let me start|by introducing myself.
{9544}{9601}I'm Professor Geller.
{9626}{9683}So to sum up...
{9690}{9784}...I'm Professor Geller.|Good job today.
{9850}{9942}- What comes with the filet mignon?|- Steamed vegetables.
{10018}{10066}Instead of the vegetables...
{10072}{10174}...is there any way that I could|substitute the...
{10180}{10231}...three-pound lobster?
{10270}{10321}You know what? Bring her both.
{10328}{10383}And I'll have the same.
{10391}{10485}Wow, this is shaping up|to be a pretty good date.
{10491}{10564}I almost forgot.|I didn't pay you the rent.
{10569}{10622}No roommate stuff. It's a date.
{10628}{10739}Wow, so I get to see what|Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.
{10745}{10775}Have any moves?
{10780}{10886}No, I'm just myself,|and if they don't like me for...
{10945}{11019}I'm sorry, I couldn't even|get through that.
{11043}{11100}I knew it. Tell me your moves.
{11106}{11144}All right.
{11149}{11179}Well...
{11185}{11300}I start by having a bottle of wine|sent to my table from a fan.
{11305}{11387}Oh, my God. And that works?
{11393}{11521}If you add, "This is embarrassing.|I just want to have a normal life."
{11526}{11585}You poor little famous man.
{11595}{11654}Okay, how about this one?
{11675}{11772}I was gonna wait until the end|of the night to kiss you...
{11777}{11871}...but you're just so beautiful,|I don't think I can.
{11885}{11919}Oh, my God!
{11968}{12070}Wow, that was fantastic!|I almost leaned in. Really.
{12075}{12127}So tell me one of your moves.
{12132}{12180}All right.
{12249}{12308}So where'd you grow up?
{12327}{12367}That's your move?
{12384}{12441}Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
{12446}{12540}- Come on, just answer the question.|- Queens.
{12548}{12603}Were you close to your parents?
{12611}{12686}- With my mom. Not so much my dad.|- Why not?
{12691}{12764}I don't know.|There's just this distance.
{12770}{12855}We both try to pretend it's not there,|but it is.
{12895}{12931}It's gotta be rough.
{12937}{13031}Yeah, it's really tough.|Sometimes I think...
{13036}{13081}Wow!
{13131}{13207}Nice move!
{13213}{13299}- "Where'd you grow up?" So simple.|- Thank you.
{13305}{13377}Now, excuse me.|I'm gonna use the restroom.
{13448}{13549}- Now you're watching me walk away.|- Yes, I am! So simple!
{13660}{13768}- You won't believe what I did today.|- Clearly not shower or shave.
{13773}{13854}I played this all day,|and now I rule.
{13860}{13941}They should change the name|to "Ms. Chandler."
{13985}{14038}Although, I hope they don't.
{14044}{14171}You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Man|while I went to work like a chump?
{14177}{14294}I got the top ten scores. I erased|Phoebe off the board. High-five!
{14327}{14398}What is the matter with your hand?
{14467}{14517}I played for eight hours.
{14522}{14591}It'll loosen up. Check out the scores.
{14596}{14678}Also, look at the initials.|They're dirty words.
{14683}{14784}- Chandler, why would you do that?|- Because it's awesome.
{14789}{14827}You think it's clever?
{14832}{14955}They only give you three letters,|so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.
{14967}{15061}- This one's not dirty.|- Put it together with that one.
{15066}{15096}Oh.
{15102}{15219}If you don't clear this off,|you won't get one of those from me.
{15233}{15299}Ben's coming over.|This can't be there.
{15304}{15396}- He won't know what they mean.|- He's 7, not stupid.
{15402}{15506}- Have you talked to him lately?|- I'm gonna unplug it.
{15511}{15599}I'll have nothing to show for my day.|Like work.
{15616}{15646}No!
{15672}{15722}Hey, look! It's still there!
{15727}{15817}This thing must have some kind|of primitive ROM chip!
{15824}{15897}- You gotta beat your scores.|- With the claw?
{15902}{15984}Fine, I'll do it.|We gotta get this off.
{15990}{16084}Carol's still upset that|you taught him "Pull my finger."
{16091}{16179}Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!
{16263}{16374}- I am not gonna answer that.|- Oh, come on. Just pick one.
{16379}{16463}Between Monica, Phoebe,|Chandler and Ross...
{16469}{16530}...if you had to,|who would you punch?
{16544}{16622}We're friends.|I wouldn't punch any of them.
{16634}{16674}Chandler?
{16680}{16746}Yeah, but I don't know why.
{16775}{16850}- I'm having a wonderful time!|- Me too!
{16855}{16947}- This is the best date I ever had.|- I know!
{16952}{17040}I laughed so hard. Did you|see the wine come out my nose?
{17045}{17109}Joey, I think everybody saw it.
{17123}{17246}I never knew I could enjoy|the non-sex part of a date so much.
{17252}{17369}That's because you have never|been on a date with me before.
{17402}{17451}All right. Now don't judge me.
{17457}{17568}I normally wait till my date leaves,|but I'm ripping into the swan.
{17573}{17638}Okay, then you don't judge me.
{17643}{17727}I'm gonna suck on the cellophane|from that brownie.
{17942}{18053}So, what are Joey Tribbiani's|end-of-the-night moves?
{18109}{18199}Well, if I want the girl to kiss me...
{18206}{18287}...first, I make my lips|look irresistible.
{18292}{18322}How do you do it?
{18331}{18421}Now you can't tell anyone, but...
{18428}{18510}...I put on shiny lip balm.
{18525}{18648}- Oh, my God.|- Like a moth to a flame, I tell you.
{18660}{18742}- Okay, now you go.|- No, I don't want to tell you.
{18747}{18792}- Why not?|- It's embarrassing.
{18801}{18887}More embarrassing than|shiny raspberry lip balm?
{18910}{18978}I didn't say raspberry before, did I?
{18990}{19066}Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
{19074}{19098}Okay.
{19105}{19153}All right, stand up.
{19211}{19267}Well, when we're at the door...
{19273}{19389}...I lightly press my lips|against his.
{19394}{19495}Then move into his body,|just for a second.
{19501}{19560}And then I make this sound:
{19696}{19769}It doesn't sound like anything,|but it works.
{19774}{19852}Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.
{19879}{19989}All right, I gotta go to bed.|I had such a wonderful time.
{20135}{20183}Me too.
{20420}{20500}You were 50 minutes late?|Did you crawl?
{20510}{20573}No, I ran, okay? It's really far.
{20579}{20680}When did people stop understanding|"Get out of my way"?
{20696}{20742}Why didn't you take a cab?
{20747}{20865}With the traffic and one-way streets,|it'd take me twice as long.
{20871}{20985}And I have class three times a week.|Who am I, Rockefeller?
{21004}{21061}You won't be able to keep doing this.
{21067}{21155}If I don't, they'll take the class|away from me.
{21162}{21234}And I put it in my family newsletter.
{21257}{21343}- Your what?|- You've seen it, "The Geller Yeller."
{21378}{21451}Right. Wow.
{21456}{21579}I figured out a faster route.|I'm sure I can make it this time.
{21586}{21709}I just can't be afraid|to get a little bit hit by cars.
{21745}{21802}- Hey.|- Hi!
{21813}{21882}Remember when we talked about "Cujo"?
{21887}{21966}I can't believe you haven't seen "Cujo."
{21971}{22019}Relax, it isn't "Citizen Kane."
{22024}{22100}Have you ever sat through|"Citizen Kane"?
{22106}{22203}Yeah, it's really boring.|But it's, like, a big deal.
{22214}{22289}Anyway, I was thinking|about renting "Cujo."
{22294}{22351}Well, let's do it tonight.
{22357}{22443}- Don't you have that big date?|- Oh, right.
{22448}{22530}- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?|- Yeah.
{22536}{22604}After our date, did you feel weird?
{22609}{22722}Oh, my God. You did too?|It freaked me out. What was that?
{22727}{22859}I don't know. I'm kind of thinking|it was the lobster.
{22931}{23004}Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.
{23009}{23090}- I was up sick all night.|- Me too. All night.
{23095}{23160}Really? We didn't cross paths.
{23165}{23235}Yeah, well, that's because...
{23240}{23299}...I stayed in my room.
{23321}{23387}You don't want to look|in my hamper.
{23501}{23537}Okay, I got that.
{23543}{23614}I'll escape there.|I'll come back here.
{23619}{23685}All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.
{23729}{23813}Well, you're just a little bitch,|aren't you?!
{23864}{23913}Hey, you guys?
{23919}{24001}I'm sorry that I was|hogging the game before.
{24008}{24157}Oh, my God! Your friends have|some unfortunate initials.
{24162}{24197}They're all Chandler.
{24202}{24257}Chandler couldn't get this good.
{24263}{24379}I did. But it came at a price.
{24396}{24460}Ben's coming, and he can't see this.
{24465}{24547}By age 7, kids have|already seen orgies.
{24635}{24684}Was it just me?
{24916}{25004}Yes, I made it! I'm on time!
{25114}{25189}Okay, why don't we all...
{25237}{25304}...open our books to page 23...
{25310}{25344}...where...
{25378}{25449}...where you will see...
{25494}{25592}...a bunch of red spots.
{25627}{25746}Okay, why don't you all start to read|while I...
{25967}{26051}Are you all right?|You seem a little distracted.
{26057}{26139}No, no, I'm fine. It's just...
{26159}{26218}Hey, can I ask you something?
{26224}{26293}Have you ever looked at someone|you know...
{26299}{26383}...and suddenly seen them|in a different way?
{26389}{26438}You mean like from behind?
{26546}{26628}Yeah. That's exactly it.
{26633}{26736}I saw this guy from behind,|and he seemed totally normal.
{26742}{26830}And then he turned around|and it was Stephen Baldwin!
{26897}{26954}So you know exactly what I mean.
{26959}{27038}Totally! Wow.
{27075}{27134}- Would you excuse me?|- Sure.
{27426}{27485}- Phoebe! You're on fire!|- I know!
{27492}{27522}You can do it!
{27527}{27575}- Don't touch me!|- Don't touch her!
{27580}{27635}Go left! Go right! Go right!
{27640}{27680}I can't! I can't!
{27686}{27762}No! You son of a...
{28075}{28117}Phoebe?!
{28129}{28219}Oh, hi, Ben.|No, don't look at the machine!
{28441}{28529}Thank God you're home!|I'm watching "Cujo."
{28534}{28645}- Alone?|- Yes! What is wrong with this dog?
{28652}{28749}Did you get to the part where Cujo|throws himself at the car?
{28754}{28848}No, seriously,|what's wrong with the dog?
{28856}{28913}Wait, what happened to your date?
{28923}{28975}Oh, it didn't work out.
{28980}{29093}- Want to watch the rest of the movie?|- Oh, okay. Yeah.
{29099}{29155}I never thought I'd say this...
{29161}{29215}...but I hope this dog dies.
{29267}{29339}What are you doing?|Sit here. Protect me.
{29344}{29421}Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?
{29670}{29762}- That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!|- I know.
{29789}{29848}It's gonna be okay.
{29855}{29982}Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?|I can't watch.
{30039}{30109}How can you watch this?|Aren't you scared?
{30201}{30250}Terrified.
{30485}{30601}So is everybody here?|I got here a little early, myself.
{30607}{30631}Let us begin.
{30644}{30785}Now, the hadrosaurids have been|unearthed in two main locations.
{30838}{30878}Here...
{30892}{30927}...and...
{30948}{30974}...here.
{30996}{31064}Now, as for the hydrosaurs...

{2063}{2115}Are you...? Are you high?
{2142}{2195}I had the most amazing bath.
{2200}{2281}- Really? I don't like baths.|- You like them with me.
{2287}{2385}Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.|It's the wet, naked lady.
{2402}{2499}- Baths are so relaxing.|- Really? What do you do?
{2504}{2598}You just sit in there,|stewing in your own filth.
{2627}{2686}How dirty do you think I am?
{2692}{2802}If you had some candles and bubbles|and music, you'd love it.
{2807}{2858}It'd take all your stress away.
{2863}{3000}It's 2:00 on Wednesday, I'm watching|"Road Rules." How stressed am I?
{3052}{3146}Hey, Chandler.|I really need to talk to you.
{3155}{3257}Is this a cold pizza|or a leftover-meat loaf talk?
{3262}{3380}- Well, neither.|- Oh, my God, what's up?
{3405}{3555}I don't know. It's just...|Lately, I've been feeling...
{3571}{3630}Okay, here's what it is.
{3741}{3865}- I feel a lot better. Thanks.|- Wait a minute. Just come back.
{3985}{4047}You and Monica,|friends for a long time.
{4052}{4160}And sure, there are rules.|But then you went to London.
{4166}{4275}But that's different. There are rules|there too, know what I mean?
{4281}{4312}Do you?
{4383}{4497}It was different for you guys.|You were both in the same place.
{4503}{4623}Yes, when Monica and I were|in London, we were both in London.
{4640}{4715}This is a bad idea.|Forget all about it.
{4720}{4798}This conversation between you and me.
{4814}{4864}If that.
{4990}{5061}Ross, don't forget|that doctor's appointment.
{5067}{5127}- Right.|- To find out the sex of the baby?
{5135}{5231}We don't wanna know|as long as it's happy and healthy.
{5237}{5289}Yep, healthy. And cute.
{5294}{5361}- Smart. With an aptitude for science.|- Popular.
{5366}{5448}Are you two talking|about the same baby?
{5465}{5563}- Have you thought of names?|- I've come up with a bunch.
{5568}{5630}- Really? Me too.|- Me too.
{5636}{5675}Really?
{5680}{5798}If it's a girl, Phoebe.|And if it's a boy, Pheebo.
{5850}{5963}Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt|to have a backup, you know?
{5969}{6022}Rach, what were you thinking?
{6027}{6098}I was thinking if it's a girl...
{6103}{6208}...how about Sandrene? It's French.
{6214}{6328}That's a really pretty name|for an industrial solvent.
{6394}{6474}- Fine. What do you have?|- It's for a boy.
{6479}{6548}I know it's a little out there, but...
{6568}{6607}...Darwin.
{6640}{6724}Our child will be beaten|in the schoolyard.
{6729}{6789}Yeah, by Sandrene.
{6795}{6862}You're saying that|because I said no to you.
{6867}{6921}I'm really, really not.
{6929}{6984}How about you each get five vetoes?
{6989}{7094}- That sounds fair.|- I don't think you'll need it.
{7100}{7182}If it's a girl, Rain.
{7203}{7279}- Veto.|- Why?
{7285}{7366}Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.
{7372}{7493}I have my own kiln,|and my dress is made out of wheat."
{7519}{7573}I know her!
{7579}{7673}I bought a homemade soap|from her at a Dead show!
{7699}{7836}- Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?|- Why do you hate our child?
{7841}{7928}- Fine, you go.|- Okay. James.
{7943}{7999}- But only if it's a girl.|- Veto.
{8005}{8065}I like Ruth. What about Ruth?
{8070}{8163}Oh, I'm sorry.|Are we having an 89-year-old?
{8203}{8267}- How about Dayton?|- Veto. Stewart.
{8272}{8311}Veto. Sawyer.
{8316}{8372}- Veto. Helen.|- Veto.
{8380}{8483}Is it me, or is Veto starting|to sound really good?
{8593}{8657}Boy, do I have a surprise for you.
{8662}{8707}Sex on the balcony?
{8712}{8809}No. But someone's not gonna|get over that idea.
{8815}{8867}- What?|- I drew you a bath.
{8872}{8988}I don't like baths. Could you draw me|a picture of sex on the balcony?
{8994}{9063}Try it for me.|I used all my best stuff.
{9069}{9196}I lit candles, I put on music.|I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.
{9202}{9327}And got you this little plastic|Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.
{9355}{9480}- This does butch it up a bit.|- I swear, you will love it.
{9485}{9559}If I do this,|can we discuss balcony sex?
{9564}{9595}Absolutely.
{9637}{9708}But I know how|that discussion's gonna go.
{9908}{10058}"All right", "this isn 't so bad."|{y:i}I like the flowery smell.
{10075}{10168}"Which is okay",|{y:i}because I've got my boat.
{10231}{10305}- So?|- Oh, my God.
{10311}{10436}I told you you were a bath person.|Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.
{10441}{10515}I'm gonna need a bigger boat.
{10719}{10801}I don't think you had|an open mind about Ruth.
{10806}{10879}Little Ruthie Geller?|How cute is that?
{10884}{11006}Oh, my God, I can practically|hear the mahjong tiles.
{11011}{11144}All your tests look fine. Are you|interested in the sex of the baby?
{11149}{11246}- No, we're not.|- You have it right there?
{11252}{11389}You know if it's a boy or a girl?|Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?
{11394}{11451}But if you don't wanna know...
{11460}{11551}- No, we wanna wait. Right?|- Right. Right.
{11581}{11641}Oh, I'll be right back.
{11647}{11712}I know it's really not my place...
{11717}{11806}...but please don't name|your child Pheebo.
{11917}{12001}So, which of these babies|is the ugliest?
{12007}{12077}What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.
{12083}{12151}They're babies.|They're all beautiful.
{12156}{12253}- Third one from the left?|- Yeah. Why is it staring at me?
{12259}{12408}I think it knows I'm talking about it.|Don't you...? You're looking!
{12413}{12448}- I didn't!|- I saw you!
{12453}{12514}Fine, I did,|but I didn't see anything.
{12519}{12605}Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
{12617}{12718}- But I didn't...|- Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!
{12726}{12782}I couldn't, because I don't know!
{12788}{12900}I swear I didn't see anything!|It was just a momentary lapse.
{12906}{12983}Don't you have any self-control?
{12988}{13095}Okay. A couple months late|on the lecture, Ross.
{13175}{13210}Hello?
{13215}{13311}Can you come in here?|There's something wrong.
{13317}{13390}You know what?|I think I'll wait out here.
{13401}{13475}I'm in the bathtub.
{13556}{13634}- What's wrong?|- I drew a bath, but I did it wrong.
{13639}{13775}The water's tepid, the salt didn't|dissolve and is now lodged places.
{13782}{13920}And the scents I used don't compliment|each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile?
{13926}{13990}- What?|- Bath salts.
{13996}{14062}They're starting to effervesce.
{14067}{14205}It's different. It's interesting.
{14212}{14276}Let's talk about something else.
{14282}{14385}Yeah. Sure. So, what was|going on with you today?
{14405}{14495}I actually had the weirdest|conversation with Joey.
{14501}{14585}He was talking about rules|and right and wrong.
{14590}{14688}- I had the same conversation.|- What was he talking about?
{14693}{14825}He hasn't had this much trouble getting|out words since he was in "Macbeth."
{14842}{14991}- That was a long night.|- What exactly did he say to you?
{14996}{15118}He was talking about rules|and looking at people differently.
{15124}{15179}- Not to me.|- What'd he tell you?
{15184}{15258}He asked about you, me and London.
{15264}{15363}And the glue that holds|this all together, the rules.
{15369}{15463}Okay. So you, me and London.
{15469}{15533}Looking at people differently.
{15539}{15627}Maybe he wants to do|what you and I did in London.
{15632}{15686}But what'd he mean by "rules"?
{15692}{15784}Wait. He stopped talking|the minute Phoebe came in.
{15792}{15886}- He's looking at her differently.|- Phoebe is his friend.
{15892}{15944}That'd be breaking the rules.
{15949}{16027}My God, he wants to do it|with Phoebe in London!
{16039}{16111}- You guys?|- Just a minute!
{16120}{16220}- That's Mrs. Tribbiani.|- You don't say anything.
{16226}{16360}Why would I? That two of our friends|could start a great love affair?
{16366}{16476}They'd have me to thank.|Then we could all start having babies!
{16482}{16560}- I won't let you say anything.|- Stay here.
{16566}{16617}Oh, God!
{16711}{16759}I brought back your iron.
{16767}{16848}I thought I lost it.|I got a new one a month ago.
{16853}{16935}Oh, just as well. I broke this one.
{17047}{17089}- What?|- Nothing.
{17144}{17236}I really shouldn't say.|I'm really not supposed to.
{17242}{17272}Fine.
{17286}{17418}- It's a humdinger.|- Too bad you can't tell me.
{17426}{17485}Somebody likes you!
{17557}{17645}- Is it Chandler?|- No!
{17650}{17751}- Then tell him to stop staring.|- It's Joey.
{17770}{17868}Really? Joey? You don't say.
{17873}{17985}- Would you be interested?|- I don't know, I don't know.
{17997}{18115}You know, I mean, on the one hand,|"Mother, may I?"
{18129}{18205}But, you know, on the other hand...
{18229}{18316}No. No, I can't. We're friends.
{18322}{18386}Oh, no. I don't wanna risk|what we have.
{18391}{18517}I guess that makes sense.|You think you're gonna talk to him?
{18522}{18630}Sure. I mean, it's Joey.|I don't want him to get hurt.
{18641}{18750}Well, I must say, I am on fire!|First Chandler, now Joey.
{18757}{18849}- Not Chandler. Just Joey.|- Sure.
{19075}{19160}You know what?|I'm coming around on the name Ruth.
{19166}{19231}I'd consider naming our child that.
{19245}{19354}Rach, I can't tell you|how much that means to me.
{19426}{19505}Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
{19510}{19631}You hated the name Ruth.|Why would you change your mind?
{19637}{19725}Unless you know we're never|gonna have to use it.
{19731}{19799}You did see. You know it's a boy!
{19805}{19883}I didn't see anything.|I changed my mind.
{19888}{19957}I don't think so.|You're giving me Ruth...
{19963}{20040}...so you get to name him|when it's a boy.
{20046}{20187}That's when you'll swoop in and|name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
{20192}{20247}I would... Sequoia!
{20252}{20324}- Veto.|- Fine.
{20391}{20543}Unless you anticipated that|I would figure all this out...
{20548}{20629}...and you know that|it actually is a girl.
{20634}{20718}And you really do want her|to be named Ruth.
{20723}{20859}Well, I'm not falling for that!|Okay? Ruth is off the table!
{20865}{20994}- But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.|- Not like this!
{21060}{21132}Hey. What's up?
{21139}{21237}- Joey, I know.|- What?
{21271}{21371}- I know.|- What?
{21386}{21487}- I know about your feelings.|- Oh, my God, you do?
{21492}{21617}I'm sorry. Things worked out for|Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.
{21623}{21747}I know. And this is so much more|complicated than it was for them.
{21753}{21836}I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.
{21856}{21941}For God's sakes, it's Rachel!
{21957}{22064}I know! She's not only my friend,|she's my pregnant friend.
{22070}{22136}She's my pregnant friend|who's Ross' ex!
{22142}{22271}Yeah, that's Rachel.|Beat me over the head with it.
{22300}{22411}What am I gonna do? I keep trying|to get rid of these feelings.
{22416}{22502}I made a list of everything|I don't like about her.
{22508}{22556}- You wanna hear it?|- Yeah.
{22632}{22761}"She made me switch to light mayo."|That's it! That's all I got!
{22766}{22866}You know what? Tastes the same|and my pants fit better.
{22887}{23017}- Joey, this is probably just a crush.|- You think?
{23023}{23124}Absolutely. You get this rush|of feelings, but it goes away.
{23129}{23237}Yeah, just a crush.|That's all this is. It's a crush!
{23243}{23311}I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.
{23316}{23386}There you go.|Crushes happen all the time.
{23392}{23516}I've had them for all you guys.|Except for Ross and Chandler.
{23521}{23641}- And I'm sure you've had them for us.|- Not really.
{23657}{23721}Throw me a bone here.
{23899}{23996}So I called the doctor.
{24010}{24110}- Now we both know the sex of the baby.|- What?
{24115}{24214}That's right.|The student has become the master.
{24225}{24362}- Ross, I swear. I don't know.|- Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.
{24367}{24462}- A what?|- You really didn't know?
{24467}{24530}- We're having a girl?|- No.
{24536}{24580}- That's what you said.|- No.
{24586}{24684}- You said girl.|- Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
{24689}{24746}I'm not! We're having a girl!
{24752}{24880}Sometimes I can't believe it's with|you, but still, we're having a girl!
{24885}{25005}I know! You know what?|I'm putting Ruth back on the table.
{25010}{25110}Yes, we'll have ourselves|a little baby Ruth.
{25197}{25256}- Permission to veto.|- Yes, please.
{25432}{25484}Do I smell essential oils?
{25489}{25585}I'm gonna take a bath.|I was gonna get a magazine.
{25961}{26030}What do you think you're doing?
{26042}{26099}Leaving my troubles behind?
{26122}{26225}You're new at this,|but this is unacceptable bath decorum.
{26231}{26318}It's so hard to care|when you're this relaxed.
{26330}{26419}You can have the bath,|but I am taking your boat.
{26429}{26497}Now you're just a girl in a tub.
{26569}{26635}Hi, bubbles. Manly.
{26640}{26704}I thought I'd let you know|how it went.
{26709}{26797}- You told her?|- She pulled it out of me!
{26802}{26895}She's like a conversational wizard!|How did it go?
{26901}{26965}You were wrong. He doesn't like me.
{26970}{27090}How would you like it if I told you|that Lee Majors liked you...
{27096}{27195}...and you found out|that he didn't like you?
{27259}{27370}- I don't think I'd care.|- Really? Lee Majors is hot.
{27387}{27490}- Hello?|- We're in the bathroom!
{27495}{27611}- Why?|- Because it's a relaxing time!
{27652}{27740}- What are you guys doing in here?|- Oh, my God.
{27746}{27856}A friend he's looking at differently,|but it's wrong.
{27862}{27919}- It's Rachel!|- You like Rachel?
{27924}{28041}It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.|It's a crush. It'll go away.
{28046}{28125}Dude, you gotta rearrange|your bubbles.
{28166}{28220}Mazel tov.
{28252}{28340}Ross and I were looking for you.
{28346}{28448}What are we all doing in here?|Oh, my.
{28489}{28567}Honey, cover it up with the boat.
{28580}{28609}Hello?
{28614}{28708}We're all in here,|and we'd love for you to join us!
{28754}{28899}Well, hey! What's going on?|Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.
{28946}{29012}- Did you tell them?|- I waited for you.
{29017}{29078}- Tell us what?|- We're having a girl.
{29083}{29165}Oh, wow! Really?
{29231}{29305}I'll get you later.
{29435}{29531}{y:i}All right. It's a new day.|{y:i}And it's just a crush.
{29537}{29601}{y:i}That's all. Just a little crush.
{29607}{29698}{y:i}All that worrying I was doing?|{y:i}That was crazy.
{29704}{29815}{y:i}Like my friend the bird here|"would say", "It was cuckoo!"
{29897}{30005}{y:i}Everything's gonna be fine.|{y:i}It's just a crush.
{30024}{30115}- Hi, sweetie.|{y:i}- I love you.
{30298}{30383}It's nice to do this together,|isn't it?
{30403}{30486}Yeah. And what you're doing|feels so good.
{30491}{30584}- I'm not touching you.|- You're not?
{30589}{30708}- It's the salts.|- Sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.
{30758}{30839}Whatever keeps you|off the balcony, big guy.

{175}{239}- What's up?|- I left my guitar here.
{245}{302}Okay. No problem.
{364}{430}Okay. Here you go.
{545}{617}- What?|- You want to hang out or something?
{633}{688}You caught me at a bad time.
{694}{758}- Are you and Chandler...?|- Exactly.
{763}{808}- Can I play for you?|- No.
{900}{945}Hey, Pheebs, what's up?
{1013}{1107}You ask an intriguing question,|Chandler Bing.
{1195}{1325}Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?|You never let me massage you.
{1331}{1428}- Phoebe, I can explain.|- You said you hate massages.
{1433}{1534}Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.|Don't let Phoebe in.
{1575}{1634}How long has this been going on?
{1644}{1729}- Well, Alexandra has...|- It has a name?
{1770}{1811}Phoebe, don't get upset.
{1816}{1942}Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.|Come on, Chandler, let's go.

{3043}{3130}One more push.|Come on, we're almost there.
{3137}{3273}I'm happy things worked out for us and|we're having this baby. I love you.
{3279}{3328}I love you too.
{3335}{3409}I hope it's not|an inappropriate time to say...
{3415}{3477}...you're the best sex I've ever had.
{3488}{3552}That's always appropriate.
{3565}{3645}Okay, come on, one more push.|One more push.
{3696}{3756}There we go.
{3762}{3912}Here is your beautiful baby.|Congratulations.
{4100}{4203}I hope you're a better father|than you are a friend!
{4314}{4343}Joey!
{4349}{4423}- What's going on?|- Come feel my belly.
{4442}{4523}- The baby's kicking for the first time.|- Really?
{4530}{4565}Yes.
{4572}{4632}You know what? Maybe you...
{4649}{4762}Maybe you should come to me.|I'm not wearing any bottoms.
{4823}{4868}Oh, my God.
{4875}{4918}It's unbelievable!
{4924}{5008}Wow, she is kicking so much.|She's like...
{5015}{5087}Who's that annoying|girl soccer player?
{5092}{5162}- Mia Hamm?|- Mia Hamm!
{5192}{5272}- It's amazing.|- One hand on the sheet, Joe.
{5279}{5327}Sorry.
{5449}{5477}Hey, babe.
{5484}{5606}We got a wedding gift from Bob and|Faye Bing. They don't like us, do they?
{5623}{5718}Who says you can't get|a nice punch bowl for under $6?
{5724}{5812}- Maybe we can take it back.|- Where would we return it?
{5818}{5892}How about to the street,|from the balcony?
{5905}{5975}Why don't we just find a place for it?
{6040}{6079}In that cabinet?
{6086}{6218}That's for canned goods. Have you|forgotten everything from orientation?
{6270}{6332}How about the closet by the bathroom?
{6338}{6418}- Okay. Let me do it.|- No, I'll do it.
{6424}{6543}You have to relax and let me|take care of things once in a while.
{6557}{6651}It's locked. You have to help me.|Why is it locked?
{6665}{6737}No reason.|I keep private things in there.
{6745}{6844}I've been here a while,|and I've never seen what's in there.
{6849}{6896}What is in there?
{6915}{6945}Feminine stuff.
{6951}{7033}Don't try to make me uncomfortable|with feminine stuff!
{7039}{7197}Nothing in there concerns you.|If you love me, you'll just let it go.
{7222}{7292}- Fine.|- Thank you.
{7412}{7462}Love you.
{7500}{7601}Hello, Chandler.|Lovely day, huh? You.
{7651}{7777}If it helps, Alexandra's only|been massaging her for three years.
{7817}{7897}Lf! I said, if it helps.
{7946}{8024}Why won't you let me massage you?
{8030}{8138}I'd be self-conscious.|You're my friend. I'd be naked.
{8145}{8236}We lived together for years.|I've seen you naked.
{8242}{8325}That's different. We were roommates.|And when?
{8374}{8440}I'm curious about the human body.
{8470}{8540}You can understand|why this would be weird.
{8546}{8610}I'm a professional|and I'm really good.
{8616}{8728}If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.|Give me a chance. Please?
{8745}{8797}If it means that much to you.
{8804}{8898}It does. How would you feel|if you couldn't share your cooking?
{8905}{9008}Or how Ross would feel|if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
{9033}{9109}- Dinosaurs.|- Potato, potahtoe.
{9208}{9257}Ross, the baby's kicking.
{9264}{9312}What? It is?
{9438}{9487}It's not kicking now.
{9493}{9598}Although we would love|to see you do that again.
{9605}{9650}When? What happened?
{9655}{9744}Last night. I went into Joey's room,|and he was sleeping.
{9750}{9812}A dreamless sleep.
{9830}{9918}My God, the baby's kicking.|That's great.
{9925}{10059}I wish I would have been there to feel|the kicking for the first time.
{10064}{10153}I got some stuff going on|if you want to feel.
{10159}{10277}I don't want to miss any more baby|stuff. Here's my pager number.
{10283}{10368}Anytime anything pregnancy-related|happens, use it.
{10375}{10449}I don't care if it's 3 a.m.|And you want ice cream.
{10455}{10517}Can I get a copy of that?
{10612}{10697}- Are you under the sheet?|- Yes.
{10738}{10808}Great, let's begin.
{10985}{11042}How's the pressure?
{11064}{11140}It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.
{11147}{11213}Stating the obvious, but thank you.
{11220}{11317}- And it's not weird, is it?|- No.
{11369}{11443}That's right, you just enjoy.
{11493}{11552}Oh, yeah!
{11672}{11777}- Oh, yeah!|- Okay.
{11795}{11867}Oh, God, Phoebe!
{11874}{11973}That's it! That's it, right there!
{12262}{12343}I wasn't trying to open|your closet, I swear.
{12369}{12509}Monica runs a pretty tight ship here,|doesn't she? What are you doing?
{12515}{12592}Monica has a secret closet.|She won't let me see it.
{12598}{12703}- Why not?|- I don't know! What's she hiding?
{12710}{12761}I don't know.
{12767}{12826}I'll bet it's Richard.
{12853}{12914}Why would she keep Richard in here?
{12920}{12973}Off the top of my head...
{12980}{13060}...maybe she's having her cake|and eating it too.
{13066}{13147}You being the "cake,"|Richard being the "too."
{13153}{13239}- Or...|- And here we go.
{13245}{13354}I saw a movie where there was a door.|Nobody knew what was behind it.
{13360}{13472}When they finally got it open,|millions of bugs came pouring out...
{13478}{13562}...and they feasted on human flesh!
{13585}{13677}It wouldn't kill you|to respect your wife's privacy!
{13773}{13866}Stupid closet full of bugs!
{13893}{14005}Joey, something feels weird|and not good weird. I don't...
{14011}{14064}When my sisters were pregnant...
{14069}{14150}...they got weird feelings|and it was always nothing.
{14156}{14197}- Really?|- Absolutely.
{14202}{14307}But we'll stop by the hospital|just to be sure. I'll page Ross.
{14314}{14462}Rach, look at me. Everything's fine.|Trust me. Take my hand. Here we go.
{14468}{14517}Crushing bones!
{14523}{14602}Good thing we're going to a hospital.
{14790}{14841}- So?|- She's fine.
{14847}{14967}She had Braxton Hicks contractions.|Mild discomfort in the uterine wall.
{14973}{15092}Mild discomfort? I take it you've had|one of these Braxton thingies?
{15098}{15141}- Everything's normal?|- Yes.
{15147}{15198}- There's no danger?|- No.
{15204}{15280}Contractions can be unnerving,|but she's fine.
{15286}{15400}Thank you, doctor.|And thank you for being nice and calm.
{15406}{15503}I wasn't calm! I've never been|more scared in my life.
{15513}{15627}- You said everything was okay.|- What do I know? I'm not a doctor.
{15649}{15727}- But everything is okay. I'm fine.|- You sure?
{15733}{15824}Yes. I got half a mind|to contract that doctor's uterus.
{15830}{15904}Mild discomfort!|What's he talking about?
{15910}{15949}- Is everything okay?|- Yes.
{15955}{16029}Your page said, "Come to|the hospital. " What happened?
{16034}{16127}Something called|Braxton Hicks contraction.
{16133}{16207}That's no big deal.|Most women don't feel them.
{16212}{16264}No uterus, no opinion.
{16314}{16353}What's with the candy?
{16359}{16438}I was at the concession stand|at the movies.
{16444}{16534}- You went to the movies by yourself?|- Mona!
{16565}{16631}- I gotta go back in there.|- What's wrong?
{16637}{16742}- I just gotta...|- No, really, tell me. What's up?
{16748}{16832}Look, I forgot my underwear.
{16898}{16968}Thanks for bringing her|to the hospital.
{16974}{17042}Don't worry about it. No big deal.
{17047}{17137}But still, it should have been me.|I'm the dad.
{17153}{17242}- Here's information on Braxton Hicks.|- Thanks.
{17249}{17319}You did the right thing|by bringing her in.
{17324}{17382}You'll make a wonderful father.
{17419}{17542}Hey, not as good as this guy.|He brought Twizzlers.
{17663}{17762}- There has got to be a way.|- Easy there, Captain Kirk.
{17813}{17870}- Do you have a bobby pin?|- Yeah.
{17877}{17974}Oh, no, wait.|I'm not a 9-year-old girl.
{17980}{18031}Then why do you throw like one?
{18055}{18141}- Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.|- Oh, sure, "Monica."
{18180}{18261}So how's the inappropriate|crush on Rachel coming?
{18267}{18374}Really good. I should be ready|to kill myself any day now.
{18379}{18457}Well, you sure found that quick.
{18533}{18657}I wish I didn't feel this way about|Rachel. I wish things could be normal.
{18663}{18782}I love living with her, and|helping out with the baby is amazing.
{18789}{18863}But now I think Ross feels left out.
{18870}{18995}When I took Rachel to the hospital,|the doctor thought I was the father.
{19002}{19080}You should have seen|the look on Ross' face.
{19085}{19198}I have no idea what I'm doing.|For all I know, I'm locking it more.
{19213}{19314}- You try opening it with a credit card?|- That's a good idea.
{19320}{19406}So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?
{19412}{19482}- I feel terrible.|- It's not your fault.
{19488}{19589}What are you gonna do, not take her?|You're doing nothing wrong.
{19595}{19700}Except for harboring love|for the woman carrying his baby.
{19810}{19922}Richard, if you're in there,|could you pass me my credit card?
{20007}{20122}I gotta tell you, yesterday was|amazing. That massage felt so good.
{20128}{20183}No, I got that.
{20189}{20277}- Can we make it a weekly appointment?|- Okay.
{20284}{20405}You should know though,|I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
{20422}{20480}- Okay.|- I mean 500.
{20493}{20552}- What?|- 600.
{20558}{20593}What's going on?
{20598}{20674}You make sex noises|when you get massaged.
{20680}{20808}It freaked me out. After a while,|I tried to hurt you. It spurred you on.
{20814}{20913}You're crazy. There's nothing sexual|about the noises I make.
{20919}{20987}There's nothing sexual about this?
{20993}{21051}Oh, God!
{21121}{21195}What are you looking at?
{21204}{21239}I mean, hi.
{21280}{21367}This is embarrassing.|I'm never getting a massage again.
{21373}{21445}Don't let this stop you|from getting massages.
{21451}{21536}I have lots of clients|that make those noises.
{21542}{21603}- Really?|- Well, not clients. Lovers.
{21659}{21760}We'll try it again. Come back,|and we'll work through it.
{21765}{21833}- You sure?|- Yes.
{21838}{21939}- I guess.|- Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.
{21945}{22032}So did you hear something you liked?
{22120}{22217}Hey, Ross, check it out!|I learned a new trick.
{22239}{22307}Hey, I bought you some lunch.
{22312}{22413}Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.
{22510}{22586}- Did you put pickles on this?|- Well, yeah.
{22605}{22688}What? What? Rach, what?
{22695}{22767}- What's going on?|- I made her tuna with pickle.
{22772}{22836}Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.
{22841}{22938}Giving her pickle is|like giving me salad.
{22950}{23012}I'm sorry, I didn't know. You okay?
{23018}{23111}I'm fine, but someone make sure|it's gone when I get out?
{23117}{23167}I'm on it!
{23210}{23292}I shouldn't be the one|making her throw up.
{23298}{23401}- It could happen to anyone.|- Not to you. You know this stuff.
{23407}{23473}I don't know any of it|and I'm the father.
{23478}{23572}I wish I could be|more involved, you know?
{23665}{23803}Well, if anyone is keeping score,|I no longer eat tuna.
{23825}{23912}Can I talk to you guys for a second?
{23918}{23977}- Yeah.|- What's up?
{23992}{24083}Sit down.|I wanna talk about our situation.
{24089}{24157}Are you breaking up with us?
{24192}{24242}The thing is...
{24295}{24418}...because I live with Rachel,|I'm here for a lot of stuff.
{24425}{24530}And Ross is missing everything. So...
{24536}{24571}Yeah?
{24600}{24664}You two should live together.
{24669}{24741}Are you asking me to move?|You don't want me here?
{24746}{24853}No, I love living with you.|It just seems that...
{24859}{24962}...if you're gonna have a roommate,|it may as well be the father.
{24968}{25112}But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me|to move in and disrupt his life.
{25152}{25207}Or he does.
{25214}{25322}I would love to be around|for you and the baby.
{25328}{25408}We can just try it,|like on a temporary basis.
{25414}{25507}- But it's you and me.|- It wouldn't be anything romantic.
{25513}{25607}I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!
{25628}{25731}I was supposed to meet her|an hour ago. What is wrong with me?
{25745}{25815}So, what do you think?
{25821}{25891}- I don't know. Is it crazy?|- No.
{25896}{25944}Joey, this is a smart idea.
{25955}{26032}Well, I was due.
{26052}{26098}- Let's do it.|- Really?
{26104}{26181}Rach, that's great. That's great.
{26435}{26517}Not too shabby.|I got this all off myself...
{26523}{26587}...using my wife's tools.
{26749}{26813}Oh, my God.
{26870}{26932}How did you get in there?
{26997}{27040}You're messy.
{27050}{27192}- No! You weren't supposed to see this!|- I married Fred Sanford.
{27197}{27263}Chandler, you don't understand.
{27338}{27453}Okay, okay, fine! Now you know.|I'm sick.
{27459}{27582}No, honey, you're not sick. I don't|love you because you're organized.
{27588}{27662}I love you in spite of that.
{27670}{27713}Really?
{27734}{27804}- Promise you won't tell anyone?|- Yes.
{27810}{27948}Now that I know, if I've got extra|stuff, can we share the closet?
{27953}{28027}Well... It's just...
{28034}{28102}I'm afraid you might mess it up.
{28285}{28403}So Rachel's all moved out?|How you taking it?
{28410}{28478}I wanted to have a few beers...
{28485}{28584}...but I got rid of those because|Rachel couldn't stand the smell.
{28590}{28677}I have thrown back a lot|of orange juice with calcium.
{28684}{28822}It's a couple weeks past its expiration|date, so it's got a bit of a kick.
{28887}{28992}- Are you okay?|- You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.
{28997}{29075}I'm better than great. I am good.
{29119}{29272}Now that she's gone, I can do stuff|around here that I couldn't do before.
{29278}{29322}Like...
{29328}{29387}I can walk around naked again.
{29394}{29438}I can...
{29444}{29527}I can watch porn in the living room.
{29544}{29590}This is good for me.
{29597}{29718}I like being on my own.|I'm better off this way.
{29724}{29782}I'm a lone wolf.
{29788}{29882}A loner. Alone.
{29892}{30002}All alone. Forever.
{30067}{30159}What's a wolf gotta do|to get a hug around here?
{30344}{30418}That's it, just relax.
{30468}{30526}- Come on, more.|- Oh, God!
{30532}{30593}You like that, don't you?
{30600}{30707}- Yeah, right there.|- Want it there? Take it there, baby.
{30753}{30847}- Phoebe?|- Yeah, say my name. Say it.
{31054}{31132}And now I'm going|to cover you back up.
{31150}{31282}And I won't be speaking with you|for several weeks.

{90}{157}- Happy Valentine's Day!|- You too!
{161}{199}How's living at Ross'?
{204}{339}It's good, except he makes us watch|the Discovery Channel all day long.
{344}{475}Something really boring happened|to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
{494}{563}Oh, thank you.|I'll see you guys later.
{651}{737}That is one lucky|to-go cup of coffee.
{782}{870}I wish you'd get over her.|I hate seeing you like this.
{877}{989}Is there anything I can do for you?|Do you wanna look down my top?
{995}{1039}Thanks. Maybe later.
{1070}{1149}- Gunther, can I get a scone?|- Want anything?
{1154}{1205}I want a lot of things.
{1212}{1277}I wanna be with the woman I love!
{1285}{1329}I want her to love me back.
{1334}{1471}And I want relief from the wrenching|pain of knowing that won't happen!
{1498}{1536}We have red bagels.
{1593}{1637}Okay.

{2570}{2631}How does Mona feel about|Rachel moving in?
{2638}{2687}I'm on my way to tell her.
{2693}{2766}She's been away all week,|but she'll be cool.
{2770}{2811}She's been so supportive.
{2815}{2924}She even got the baby a T-shirt|that says "Fossils are my friends."
{2966}{3027}Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.
{3037}{3080}So I'm gonna take off.
{3086}{3184}Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot!|Rachel wanted to see this tape.
{3190}{3255}- What is it?|- My friend giving birth.
{3261}{3325}Could you take it to your apartment?
{3331}{3401}"Candy and Cookie"?
{3407}{3470}Candy's the mom,|Cookie's the daughter.
{3474}{3529}The father's name is also Cookie.
{3577}{3646}Why am I friends with these people?
{3665}{3745}I wanna show you|something in the bathroom.
{3750}{3788}Monica, grow up.
{3827}{3975}- What's behind your back?|- Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.
{3981}{4049}- You don't want my opinion?|- Not really.
{4054}{4121}Come on, I'm your older brother.|Ask me.
{4126}{4169}Okay, big brother.
{4174}{4303}Which one would make your best friend|want to do your little sister?
{4439}{4479}The red one.
{4634}{4664}Hey.
{4670}{4776}I know you're depressed,|so I brought someone to cheer you up.
{4782}{4868}Right outside is a real,|live, furry playmate.
{4873}{4949}I'm not sleeping|with your friend Jane again.
{5039}{5115}Hey, a dog!
{5121}{5203}Who, you gotta admit,|looks a lot like Jane.
{5214}{5323}He's the happiest dog ever.|I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
{5330}{5402}So you can keep him|till he cheers you up.
{5407}{5509}Thanks so much, Pheebs.|We are gonna have so much fun!
{5514}{5561}Oh, not that kind of fun.
{5735}{5790}Happy Valentine's!
{5800}{5950}I'm slipping into something a bit less|comfortable and a bit more slutty.
{6010}{6076}"Candy and Cookie"?
{6155}{6214}"Candy and Cookie"?!
{6219}{6276}Monica got me porn?
{6309}{6380}Girl-on-girl porn?!
{6402}{6459}She really must love me!
{6704}{6801}"- Yeah", "just relax."|- I love you, St. Valentine.
{6983}{7052}Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.
{7061}{7116}{y:i}Now push!
{7153}{7204}"Oh", "God", "it hurts!"
{7209}{7289}Worst porn ever!|Worst porn ever!
{7301}{7393}"- Oh", "make it stop!"|- I am trying!
{7449}{7504}Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!
{7516}{7581}You're cute, but you're not too smart.
{7673}{7734}Did I just throw this?
{7778}{7804}- Hi.|- Hi.
{7809}{7889}I accidentally packed these|with my stuff.
{7895}{7972}- Who is this?|- Phoebe's friend's dog.
{7977}{8057}I don't know his real name.|I call him Mozzarella.
{8088}{8209}You are so cute. I wish I could play,|but I've gotta go to work.
{8214}{8320}I hope I stop talking like this|before my meeting. Yes, I do.
{8340}{8414}Bye-bye, Joey.|Seriously, I can't stop it.
{8485}{8531}Come here! Hey!
{8566}{8644}That's Rachel. She used to live here.
{8649}{8743}Might as well be honest with you.|We love her.
{8750}{8813}But we can't have her.
{8831}{8882}I really miss her.
{8894}{8984}Hey, you understand, right?|You're a guy.
{9000}{9057}Well, you used to be.
{9300}{9357}So, what do you think?
{9412}{9452}I've still got it.
{9476}{9542}- Why did you get me this?|- What is it?
{9547}{9662}It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.
{9694}{9749}Oh, the dilating!
{9777}{9896}Is this the video of the birth? It's|Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?
{10005}{10105}I thought maybe you got me porn|for Valentine's Day.
{10134}{10243}If you thought I was gonna|get you porn for Valentine's Day...
{10248}{10295}...you were right.
{10321}{10424}It's about a girl who moves|to the city in search of stardom...
{10428}{10509}...but ends up having sex|with a lot of guys.
{10514}{10549}It got four stars.
{10555}{10612}Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.
{10653}{10719}- Anyway, you wanna take a look?|- Well...
{10723}{10848}- I'm not really in a sexy mood.|- Hey, what's going on?
{10854}{10924}Remember the first time|you saw "Jaws..."
{10930}{11026}...how long it took|to go back in the water?
{11070}{11145}We can't let this tape|wreck Valentine's Day.
{11150}{11263}- You don't know. You didn't see it.|- Childbirth is beautiful.
{11268}{11329}Oh, beautiful? Really?
{11334}{11393}You think this is beautiful?
{11484}{11576}Oh, my God!|No wonder my mother hates me!
{11623}{11690}- See, honey, there's...|- Don't touch me!
{11748}{11812}- Hi!|- Hey!
{11837}{11890}- How was Atlantic City?|- Good.
{11896}{11955}I brought you back a present.
{11962}{12005}You didn't have to...
{12011}{12064}Saltwater taffy?!
{12086}{12131}Thanks.
{12137}{12206}Interestingly, it isn't made|with seawater.
{12210}{12323}It's actually made|with salted fresh water.
{12327}{12384}That's not interesting.
{12389}{12471}- I think it's interesting.|- Me too. I missed you!
{12504}{12549}- How was your week?|- Good.
{12569}{12636}- The baby started kicking.|- How exciting!
{12640}{12757}It was amazing. The only thing is,|I wasn't there the first time.
{12762}{12860}- Oh, no.|- I was missing out on all this stuff.
{12865}{12986}- Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.|- Yeah, right.
{13013}{13079}- What?|- Joey cracks me up.
{13085}{13182}"Have your ex-wife move in.|That wouldn't be awkward."
{13300}{13357}Lmagine, I go away for a few days...
{13361}{13453}...and my boyfriend is living|with a woman he got pregnant.
{13540}{13580}So, what'd you tell him?
{13864}{13929}You didn't tell Mona|Rachel moved in?
{13935}{14021}She seemed to think|it was such a crazy idea.
{14027}{14124}Plus, she got me taffy.
{14129}{14197}- Really? I've never had any.|- Ever?
{14202}{14319}My mom was too busy planning her|suicide to provide saltwater treats.
{14339}{14373}Thank you.
{14397}{14439}Are you gonna tell her?
{14444}{14509}I will. I want to butter her up first.
{14515}{14622}I'm gonna take her to dinner,|do all this romantic stuff.
{14628}{14704}When she thinks|I'm the best boyfriend ever...
{14710}{14806}...I'll tell her my pregnant|ex-girlfriend is living with me.
{14811}{14928}If I haven't said it before,|she's a lucky, lucky lady.
{14955}{15049}So where are...?|What the crap is up with this stuff?
{15103}{15191}Is it gum? Is it food?|What's the deal?
{15247}{15304}Oh, it's nice.|May I try a pink one?
{15385}{15512}So between her and me being friends,|and her history with Ross...
{15518}{15567}...it just isn't gonna happen.
{15573}{15675}It'd be like you falling in love|with a cat.
{15697}{15758}- Hey.|- Hey.
{15765}{15877}How's my favorite dog, huh?|How's my favorite dog?
{15898}{15939}You're subdued.
{15944}{16034}- Did you give him a beer?|- No.
{16046}{16134}- Will you excuse us? We need to talk.|- Sure.
{16164}{16211}Oh, me, right.
{16275}{16367}- He's miserable. What happened to him?|- Nothing.
{16372}{16429}- We talked about stuff.|- What stuff?
{16451}{16494}Rachel stuff.
{16508}{16638}Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!|This is the happiest dog in the world.
{16643}{16702}He spends a day with you, and look!
{16748}{16791}He's breathing.
{16814}{16877}- I'll take him to Wendy's.|- He's fine.
{16882}{16908}Look.
{16914}{16947}Here's your ball!
{16953}{17031}Get your ball!|Get your ball!
{17063}{17139}God, what have I done to you?
{17145}{17231}I broke the dog, Pheebs!|I broke the dog!
{17290}{17387}I'm going to pick up Mona.|What are you doing tonight?
{17393}{17450}Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans.
{17457}{17559}I've got Chinese food on the way,|and your saltwater taffy.
{17570}{17666}Interestingly, it isn't made|with seawater...
{17671}{17749}We actually watched|the documentary together.
{17785}{17855}Oh, my Chinese food.|I'll get my cash.
{17977}{18019}Mona?
{18050}{18111}What are...?|Hi! How are you?
{18119}{18178}I'm supposed to pick you up.
{18183}{18275}I made you a Valentine's dinner.|Surprise!
{18359}{18464}- Oh! Hey, Mona!|- Hi, Rachel.
{18469}{18519}What's she doing here?
{18528}{18581}I have no idea.
{18604}{18684}I'll be watching TV|if anybody needs me.
{18700}{18734}What is she doing?
{18739}{18819}Lately she just likes|hanging out here.
{18826}{18905}- Why?|- I think she's lonely.
{18924}{19004}But it's Valentine's Day.|Can't we ask her to go?
{19010}{19089}Well, no, she's way too emotional.
{19095}{19175}And by emotional, I mean crazy!
{19245}{19309}That's just my Chinese food.
{19314}{19361}She has food delivered here?
{19367}{19482}Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.
{19524}{19627}I'm gonna get in my sweats|and eat this in bed.
{19697}{19791}And you thought|she was gonna be in our way!
{19805}{19909}Open the champagne,|and I will be right back.
{19915}{20018}- I've got a surprise.|- You got another ex-wife back there?
{20049}{20102}Please start drinking.
{20224}{20301}- I'm just gonna grab the phone.|- Rachel, wait.
{20328}{20394}I hope you don't take this|the wrong way.
{20400}{20480}- What are you doing?|- Do you need the phone?
{20492}{20529}No.
{20534}{20628}Ross is too nice to say it,|but this is his apartment.
{20634}{20738}We need boundaries, so why don't|you go back to your place?
{20743}{20815}But, Mona, I live here.
{20868}{20956}Happy Valentine's Day!
{21059}{21169}Or, something to remember me by.
{21360}{21446}- How long has it been this time?|- Ninety seconds.
{21452}{21544}Ninety seconds is a long time|not to think about it.
{21550}{21614}Except all I did was think about it.
{21620}{21659}I know. It haunts me.
{21665}{21804}Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was|my dad doing shots off the houseboy.
{21810}{21909}After this, I would gladly|make that my screen saver.
{21915}{22036}We have to get past this.|We'll pretend it never existed.
{22047}{22075}I could do that.
{22205}{22291}Now all we gotta do|is get rid of this chair.
{22636}{22695}- Oh, thank God!|- I know.
{22713}{22747}Come in!
{22751}{22826}Hi. I'm sorry to barge in|on your Valentine.
{22830}{22920}I had to get away from the yelling.|Mona's dumping Ross.
{22926}{22981}- Oh, my God.|- Poor Ross.
{23069}{23188}We watch him do yoga in his underwear,|but for this he closes the drapes.
{23223}{23299}You know that birthing tape|you wanted to see?
{23305}{23329}It's here.
{23335}{23434}We should warn you before|you watch it. Don't watch it.
{23456}{23499}You saw it? Is it scary?
{23504}{23588}It's ironic how footage|of someone being born...
{23595}{23667}...can make you want to kill yourself.
{23685}{23781}Now I'm all freaked out.|Will you watch it with me?
{23786}{23897}No, but I'll leave a sweater that|smells like me right next to you.
{23918}{24004}Seriously, you're not gonna|make me watch this alone.
{24082}{24143}She's right. Of course not.
{24149}{24200}Honey, get the tape.
{24370}{24466}This reminds me of a very specific|part of the tape.
{24550}{24595}Here we go.
{24600}{24641}Okay.
{24692}{24732}Oh, my.
{24764}{24819}"All right", "baby. One more time."
{24825}{24905}Why is that baby torturing that woman?
{24910}{24994}Why have I seen this thing|three times?
{25042}{25070}It's beautiful.
{25076}{25211}- It's horrible!|- I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!
{25230}{25330}- You guys! You guys, look!|- What? Did her ass explode?
{25390}{25465}No, the baby's out. Look.
{25505}{25605}Look at those little fingers and toes.
{25610}{25661}Look how happy the mom is now.
{25690}{25795}- Oh, Rach.|- Screw you! You don't have to do it!
{25894}{25937}- Hey.|- Hey!
{25943}{26027}- What's up?|- Mona just dumped me.
{26033}{26100}Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
{26105}{26213}Lately, I haven't exactly been|the perfect boyfriend.
{26217}{26281}I didn't tell her|I got Rachel pregnant.
{26287}{26408}I gave her a key to my apartment|and then had the locks changed.
{26415}{26499}Then I lied to her about Rachel|moving in with me.
{26505}{26622}In a way, I judge her for not|breaking up with me sooner.
{26628}{26718}That really sucks.|Especially on Valentine's Day.
{26724}{26812}Wait a minute.|What are you doing here?
{26818}{26887}Joey without a date|on Valentine's Day?
{26893}{26971}What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
{27007}{27062}- Sort of.|- Really?
{27069}{27138}You don't have to seem|so happy about it.
{27158}{27203}Maybe I can help.
{27248}{27329}Whatever it is,|I am sure it has happened to me.
{27356}{27450}You know, actually,|once I got dumped during sex.
{27572}{27669}- So anyway, what is it?|- Forget about it. It's no big deal.
{27675}{27734}- Come on, what is it?|- It's nothing.
{27740}{27806}Hey, it's me.|Why can't you tell me?
{27866}{27952}Okay. Sit down.
{28045}{28135}There's this woman that I like a lot.
{28140}{28193}But it can't happen.
{28221}{28259}She's not a Tribbiani?
{28324}{28350}No!
{28386}{28457}So is she someone from work?
{28494}{28518}Yes.
{28536}{28581}Well, does she like you?
{28629}{28684}Sometimes I think she could.
{28690}{28751}But I can't do anything about it.
{28757}{28783}Why not?
{28790}{28832}It's complicated.
{28869}{28930}She was with this other guy.
{28936}{28987}Someone from work too.
{29025}{29109}I could never do that to the guy.|We're friends.
{29131}{29256}So this guy she used to go out with,|is he still in love with her?
{29261}{29330}- No, I don't think so.|- Okay.
{29336}{29378}Is he a good guy?
{29418}{29463}Yeah, he's the best.
{29469}{29534}- Then talk to him.|- I don't know.
{29539}{29616}It's worth finding out,|if you like her.
{29621}{29660}I do, so much.
{29666}{29734}I can't stop thinking about her.|I can't...
{29740}{29822}You know what?|You have to go for it.
{29828}{29951}How often does this happen to you?|You owe it to yourself.
{29966}{30015}Here's your warm milk.
{30124}{30198}I'm gonna put the bourbon|in it at home.
{30246}{30365}Anyway, seriously,|just talk to the guy, okay?
{30369}{30428}Let me know how it goes.
{30462}{30507}It's Rachel.
{30728}{30804}{y:i}You're having a baby|{y:i}and you need to prepare.
{30809}{30926}{y:i}You're gonna make yourself watch|{y:i}the whole thing. Just do it!
{31003}{31089}{y:i}I came to the big city|{y:i}to become a star.
{31104}{31205}{y:i}- I'll do anything to make that happen.|{y:i}- Anything?
{31209}{31318}{y:i}Maybe it starts with|{y:i}how she gets pregnant.

{188}{240}But it's complicated.
{244}{326}She was with this other guy|for a long time.
{331}{411}I could never do that to the guy.|We're friends.
{416}{516}So this guy she used to go out with,|is he a good guy?

{1363}{1450}I'm sorry, did you just say|it's Rachel?
{1485}{1525}Yes.
{1607}{1641}You like Rachel?
{1684}{1765}Yes. I like Rachel.
{1936}{1974}Rachel?!
{1986}{2059}Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...
{2065}{2121}You know who else I like? You.
{2127}{2217}And it doesn't get said enough.|I like you, Ross.
{2272}{2330}- Rachel Rachel?|- It's not a big deal.
{2334}{2418}It's not a big deal?|I'm sorry, I just...
{2449}{2501}What about the stuff you said?
{2507}{2619}How you can't stop thinking about her?|How you can't sleep?
{2624}{2668}I'm an actor, you know?

{2941}{3016}It's not like anything's|ever gonna happen.
{3022}{3093}These are just feelings.|They'll go away.

{4560}{4627}Okay, she's kicking.
{4649}{4710}She's growing inside you.
{4745}{4854}- That was a big one.|- That's the youngest girl to reject me.
{4876}{4912}- You guys!|- Hey there.
{4918}{4996}Let me ask you.|Do you believe in soul mates?
{5002}{5032}Oh, yes, I do.
{5037}{5104}There's one person out there|for everyone.
{5110}{5181}You know how you find him?|Stop looking.
{5187}{5259}I've stopped looking|for Russell Crowe.
{5265}{5308}He'll find me.
{5313}{5340}And you?
{5347}{5471}No. I believe that certain people are|more suited for each other, but...
{5476}{5539}- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.|- Good.
{5544}{5611}- Why?|- Well, last night, I met Monica's.
{5727}{5757}What?
{5763}{5856}I had a date with this guy.|I swear he's her other half.
{5861}{5985}You don't think there's somebody|better suited for Monica than me?
{6060}{6109}Well, what's he like?
{6119}{6196}- He's tall. He has brown hair.|- Of course.
{6201}{6308}A tall guy with hair similar to mine?|Oh, unknowable universe!
{6324}{6386}- He works with food.|- Oh, sure. Older?
{6391}{6476}- Obviously. And he's British.|- I was just gonna ask!
{6481}{6588}And he's so centered,|and mature and confident.
{6593}{6652}It's so sad they never met.
{6657}{6766}Luckily, the guy she settled for|can't hear you.
{6777}{6839}Oh, I'm so sorry.|Maybe I'm wrong.
{6845}{6915}We're going out again.|I'll find out more.
{6920}{6991}He's meant for her,|and you're gonna date him?
{6996}{7074}He may not be my soul mate,|but a girl's gotta eat.
{7251}{7329}I talked to Joey.|I wanted to see you.
{7334}{7432}I still can't believe it.|Joey and Rachel?
{7437}{7512}It's like you and me going out,|only weirder.
{7536}{7586}I know you're hurting...
{7592}{7639}...but don't say that again.
{7679}{7781}What if they marry?|He'd be the stepfather of my child.
{7786}{7837}You don't need to worry.
{7843}{7902}He'll never tell her how he feels.
{7908}{7977}If he did, you don't know|how she'd react.
{7982}{8078}Sure, women never like Joey.|I think he's a virgin.
{8101}{8198}- He isn't thinking about going for her.|- He's not?
{8204}{8292}All he's thinking about|is how you're taking this.
{8298}{8392}It's freaking him out.|He wants to move to Vermont.
{8416}{8501}- Why?|- He wants to leave the country.
{8611}{8656}He thinks you hate him.
{8685}{8722}Hate him?
{8757}{8822}No, I don't hate him.
{8882}{8952}It's just, it's Rachel. You know?
{8958}{9056}I can't even imagine how hard|this must be for you...
{9061}{9157}...but I don't want you|to lose Joey over it.
{9163}{9268}Right now, he needs to know|that you're still his friend.
{9301}{9371}Okay, I'll talk to him.
{9377}{9417}I'd do it soon.
{9423}{9540}He just asked me how to convert|his dollars into Vermont money.
{9703}{9740}- Hi!|- Hi.
{9745}{9826}- Chandler, Monica, this is Don.|- Hello.
{9883}{9922}Soul mate.
{9995}{10079}- What are you guys doing?|- We had lunch at Adriatica.
{10085}{10196}- What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?|- I know! Is this 1985?
{10201}{10290}- That's what I said! Isn't it strange?|- Not really.
{10322}{10383}What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?
{10429}{10496}On a barbecued-chicken pizza?
{10502}{10536}No?
{10570}{10657}- What restaurants do you like?|- Octavio. 27-and-7.
{10662}{10766}- There's this place, Alessandro's.|- Oh, my God! I'm the chef!
{10771}{10839}You're kidding!|Your food is fantastic!
{10845}{10943}I want to talk about your menu.|Anyone want coffee?
{10948}{11026}If you're talking about me,|I'll go with you.
{11092}{11132}What are you doing?
{11147}{11228}I swear, I didn't know you guys|would be here.
{11234}{11292}You don't believe in soul mates, so...
{11297}{11392}I believe in handsome strangers|who hit on my wife.
{11397}{11522}Just because I think they're soul mates|doesn't mean anything'll happen.
{11527}{11583}Phoebe? Good work.
{11588}{11652}He's great. I love him.
{11712}{11787}Don't worry, we'll find you|someone else.
{12100}{12191}I understand if you came by to hit me.|I deserve it.
{12196}{12251}No, I don't want to hit you.
{12256}{12316}What, then? Kick me?
{12324}{12354}No.
{12377}{12419}Bite me?
{12436}{12497}I don't want to do anything to you.
{12503}{12580}I just want to say I'm not|mad at you...
{12615}{12694}...and that I certainly|do not hate you.
{12723}{12786}I just came here to say that.
{12791}{12847}Hey, wait, Ross?
{12878}{12970}You wanna come in|for a beer or something?
{13025}{13071}Yeah, sure.
{13162}{13225}You got any beer?
{13293}{13371}All I got is melon stuff|that Rachel left.
{13381}{13414}Okay.
{13598}{13673}You need to understand something.
{13767}{13871}I am never gonna act|on this Rachel thing, okay?
{13877}{13992}I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize|my friendship with you.
{14022}{14060}Thank you.
{14456}{14560}Anyway, it'll just...
{14564}{14646}It'll take me a while to get over her.
{14652}{14751}I'm not sure how to do that.|I've never been in love, so...
{14757}{14793}What?
{14855}{14916}You're in love with her?
{14922}{15034}- Yeah. I thought you knew that.|- No.
{15079}{15186}Look, if it helps, I don't want|to feel this way, honest.
{15191}{15296}I just keep thinking,|"I'll get over this," you know?
{15302}{15396}But it just keeps getting harder.
{15401}{15484}I don't know what to do, you know?
{15520}{15571}What do I do?
{15711}{15859}- You need to tell her how you feel.|- That's the green stuff talking.
{15907}{15991}I'm serious.|You need to find out where she is.
{15997}{16090}If she's not where you are,|you can start to move on.
{16097}{16172}But what if,|and I'm not saying she will be...
{16177}{16257}If she is where you are...
{16317}{16419}...then my feeling weird|shouldn't stand in the way.
{16431}{16493}- Are you sure?|- Yeah.
{16528}{16592}If she ends up with somebody else...
{16598}{16690}...the truth is,|she couldn't find a better guy.
{16709}{16752}Hey, thanks.
{16783}{16910}- So when are you gonna talk to her?|- Oh, my God. I have to tell her.
{16937}{17020}I haven't thought about it.|What should I say?
{17025}{17117}I'm understanding,|but let's not get carried away.
{17181}{17226}What am I gonna say?
{17319}{17379}Yeah, tell me about it.
{17726}{17850}I'm phasing out the wine importing|and focusing more on the cheese.
{17855}{17901}Cheese, you say?
{17907}{17986}That's some|pretty smelly work, huh, Don?
{18001}{18088}- Excuse me?|- Cheese. It's smelly.
{18109}{18193}You must smell a lot of the time too.
{18236}{18347}Not really. But with cheese,|I think the smellier, the better.
{18352}{18465}Me too! Chandler hates it.|I can't have blue cheese in the house.
{18470}{18544}And you're still married to him?
{18643}{18781}I would like to go to France and eat|nothing but bread and cheese.
{18787}{18841}Not even bread. Just cheese.
{18846}{18892}No, I want the bread.
{18907}{18955}And pastries.
{18962}{19011}And pate.
{19020}{19108}I'm really not high.|I just used to be fat.
{19126}{19212}I have a villa in the Loire Valley|you can stay in.
{19217}{19268}Is it made of cheese?
{19339}{19425}No. A house made of cheese,|wouldn't that be great?
{19430}{19498}- I'd move in tomorrow!|- Oh, come on!
{19540}{19594}- Listen to this!|- I'm so sorry.
{19599}{19703}- What do we do?|- They both want a house of cheese.
{19720}{19789}I don't know how you fight that.
{19940}{20047}Okay, okay. I can do this.|I can tell her how I feel.
{20053}{20109}Okay, stand up straight.
{20115}{20184}Take a couple deep breaths.
{20223}{20268}Look confident.
{20361}{20408}Joey? What's up?
{20414}{20519}I came by because|I want to talk to you about something.
{20524}{20550}What's up?
{20559}{20631}Here, in the hall?|What are we, animals?
{20636}{20719}I'm late for a meeting.|Could you make it quick?
{20736}{20811}I just came by to tell you that...
{20820}{20913}...I want to have dinner with you.
{20918}{20984}Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.
{21075}{21112}Okay. That's good.
{21118}{21197}That gives you a couple of hours|to prepare.
{21220}{21282}Don't you people ever knock?
{21322}{21386}I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
{21391}{21426}Sure. Set it up.
{21431}{21509}I'll just be browsing|through the personals.
{21535}{21593}Are you okay?|You're acting weird.
{21598}{21623}Yeah. Fine.
{21629}{21661}Not perfect.
{21666}{21712}But good enough.
{21722}{21762}Jeez, what's with you?
{21767}{21840}I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?
{21874}{21976}- What's going on?|- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.
{21981}{22059}I don't believe in that,|but you two get along.
{22065}{22191}I'll step aside if you wanna go with|Don and live in a house of cheese.
{22197}{22319}- You don't believe in soul mates?|- No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.
{22353}{22425}I don't believe in soul mates, either.
{22430}{22461}- You don't?|- Nope.
{22466}{22529}We weren't destined|to end up together.
{22535}{22621}We fell in love and work hard|at our relationship.
{22627}{22691}Some days we work really hard.
{22706}{22807}So you don't want to live with Don|in a cheese house?
{22812}{22956}No, I've had second thoughts.|Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?
{22962}{23021}- I love you.|- I know.
{23026}{23086}I'm gonna take you out to dinner.
{23091}{23198}I found this place that makes|the greatest jalapeno poppers.
{23240}{23288}No? They taste so good.
{23438}{23523}It happens whenever Chandler|touches my stomach.
{23528}{23597}I'm worried the baby won't like him.
{23669}{23748}- Are you okay?|- Yeah, sure.
{23813}{23880}Look, the reason...
{23931}{23978}Is it hot in here?
{23983}{24061}Why don't you take off your sweater?
{24082}{24132}This is a nice place...
{24138}{24253}...and my T-shirt has a picture|of Calvin doing Hobbes.
{24258}{24349}Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?
{24354}{24384}Yeah, sure.
{24452}{24540}I wouldn't think Hobbes|would like that so much.
{24691}{24753}How long have we known each other?
{24758}{24803}Seven, eight...
{24809}{24871}Eight years. Wow.
{24882}{24913}A long time.
{24946}{25017}But over the past few weeks, l...
{25023}{25131}Okay! Sorry about the wait,|but it is mega-jammed in here.
{25136}{25178}Our specials tonight...
{25183}{25246}- Could you give us a second?|- Sure.
{25251}{25283}Second's up!
{25365}{25447}Not that kind of table.
{25527}{25563}So you were saying?
{25609}{25637}I'm not sure.
{25643}{25756}You asked how long we knew each other,|and I said eight years.
{25762}{25868}Then the waiter came over|and cut his tip in half...
{25911}{25958}...and now here we are.
{25967}{26040}Yeah. Here we are.
{26272}{26343}I think I'm falling in love with you.
{26396}{26433}What?
{26484}{26553}I'm falling in love with you.
{26751}{26801}Who are you talking to?
{26839}{26906}Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.
{26932}{26977}Funny. It's funny!
{26983}{27033}I don't get it.
{27257}{27295}Okay.
{27383}{27423}Wow.
{27490}{27532}Are you...?
{27599}{27656}How did...?
{27682}{27712}When?
{27769}{27828}Does it really matter?
{27893}{27936}Wow. Wow.
{27942}{27994}It is hot in here.
{27999}{28041}I know this is a lot.
{28047}{28125}You don't have to say anything.
{28152}{28232}You take as much time as you need.
{28399}{28455}Okay, you gotta say something.
{28476}{28586}Joey, I love you so much.
{28591}{28641}- But...|- But.
{28657}{28696}Joey?
{28702}{28765}Right. Hey, that's...
{28772}{28826}That's okay. That's fine.
{28831}{28949}It's pretty much what I was expecting.
{28983}{29044}It's no big deal, all right?
{29120}{29211}- I think I'm gonna go.|- Please don't leave like this.
{29216}{29306}You can't do this to a pregnant woman!
{29326}{29366}Don't start doing that.
{29372}{29457}You can't do that,|because you're gonna make me...
{29462}{29510}Oh, there we go!
{29570}{29644}- Can I?|- Sure.
{29690}{29751}Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...
{29756}{29807}Hey, hey.
{29852}{29940}You can't, okay? Ever.
{29966}{30029}I'm so sorry.
{30034}{30108}Please don't be sorry.
{30114}{30167}Okay? Don't be sorry.
{30373}{30436}You know, I was only kidding.
{30466}{30522}Yeah, that was a real good one.
{30777}{30823}- Is this your table?|- Yeah.
{30828}{30888}- You'll be here all night.|- I know.
{30894}{30956}I haven't even read the specials.
{30968}{31003}What's the matter?
{31008}{31123}I don't know.|I think maybe one of them is dying.
{31183}{31251}I kind of hope it's the girl.
{31274}{31349}The guy is really cute!

1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,837
Joey? Are you in there?

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,548
- That's Rachel.
- You have to talk to her.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,355
I can't. Not after the other night.
It's too weird.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,476
Don't tell her I'm here.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,871
Don't eat that!

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,389
- Hey!
- Hey, Rachel.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,039
Is Joey here?

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,236
- I don't see him. You?
- No.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,756
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,518
Well, at least you make
each other laugh.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,396
- What's up?
- I haven't seen him since he said...

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,152
...how he, you know...

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,880
I don't know,
I think he's avoiding me.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,713
Why is that bagel on the floor?

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,758
- We were playing a game.
- Was Chandler naked?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,997
Sort of like a ring-toss
kind of situation?

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,632
- Sure!
- What? No! No!

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,075
All right, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that...?

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,992
Tell him I miss him.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,998
- Okay. Did you hear that?
- Yeah. That naked bagel game?

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,995
Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty
small hole.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,028
- You've gotta talk to her.
- I can't.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,273
You guys don't know what it's like
to get shot down.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,635
I don't know what that's like?

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,510
Until I was 25, I thought the response
to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,954
No rejection?

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,192
I got shot down at fat camp.

28
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,397
Boy, kids are mean
when they're hungry.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,632
So, what do I do?

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,912
It's Rachel.
You're gonna never talk to her again?

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,073
It's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,913
Yeah, okay.

33
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,710
I forgot this was on your...

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,155
We didn't play it!

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,150
The One With the Tea Leaves

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,356
I'll look at your tea leaves
and tell your fortune.

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,918
- You read tea leaves?
- I've done it for years.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,197
I actually stopped
because I was so accurate.

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,715
And one of the great joys
of life...

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,872
...is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,873
And also,
tea tends to give me the trots.

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,592
- Okay. I'm done. Read mine.
- Okay.

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,909
I see a ladder.

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,789
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,238
I'm the head chef.
I can't get promoted.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,838
Who's next?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,558
I'm done. Do mine.

48
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,119
Okay.

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,519
Oh! Okay, I see a circle.

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,270
Which can either mean
you're having a baby...

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,113
...or you'll make
a scientific discovery!

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,637
Well, I have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,914
- What does yours say, Pheebs?
- All right.

54
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,396
Wow! Yay!

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,599
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy!
And really soon!

56
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,035
He's gonna be the man of my dreams.

57
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,909
Probably not the guy
I had a dream about last night.

58
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,671
Has anyone seen my shirt?

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,355
It's a button-down, like
a faded salmon color?

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,715
You mean your pink shirt?

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,477
Faded salmon color?

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,074
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.

63
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,752
I must have left it at Mona's.
I knew it!

64
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,196
I'm sure you can get another one
at Ann Taylor's.

65
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,234
That's my favorite shirt.
I love it.

66
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,311
Ask Mona to give it back.

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,232
I don't know. I could.

68
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,836
We didn't really end things
on good terms.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,959
If I went, I'd be ignoring the
one thing she asked me to do...

70
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,793
...jump up my own ass and die.

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,748
Oh, wait a second, you guys?

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,958
I've been seeing that guy
everywhere I go.

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,476
We take the same bus,
go to the same bookstore.

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,278
Maybe he's the tea guy.

75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,834
Did you see that?

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,549
He totally checked you out!
And he is so cute!

77
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,913
Mine is a picture of the Village
People. What's that mean?

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,233
Hi.

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,038
Hey.

80
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,994
- Hi.
- Hi.

81
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,559
Tea gives Phoebe the trots!

82
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,480
I thought Joey and I
would be okay...

83
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,108
...but we don't know
how to be together.

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,869
- It's tough, but things will improve.
- How do you know?

85
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,395
What if it gets worse and worse...

86
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,189
...to the point where we
can't be in the same room?

87
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,510
I'm not great at the advice.

88
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,990
Can I interest you
in a sarcastic comment?

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,235
Some cheese?

90
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,958
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?

91
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,874
If I can't find the right case,
I use the nearest one.

92
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,636
- Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
- The James Taylor case.

93
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,439
- Where is that CD?
- I'll save you time.

94
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,070
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.

95
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,397
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.

96
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,030
We'll just have to put the CDs
in their right cases.

97
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,318
If we do that, we should
come up with some kind of order.

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,836
We have to talk this through.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,836
Oh, my God, you have such
problems! I feel so terrible for you!

100
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,509
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

101
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,877
You're both focusing on
this uncomfortable thing.

102
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,917
Change the subject.

103
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,073
Get him talking about something else.

104
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,798
Yeah, that makes sense.

105
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,111
Maybe you need his advice
on a work problem...

106
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,158
- I could do that.
- Good.

107
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,469
The Miami Vice soundtrack?
Really?

108
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,797
They were just giving those away
at the store.

109
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,913
In exchange for money.

110
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,792
Hey.

111
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,794
I really don't know what to tell you.

112
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,397
Maybe Joey could help you out
with your big work problem.

113
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,756
- What?
- Yeah, Joey, she's...

114
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,550
Rachel's got this big work problem.
It is a head-scratcher.

115
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,475
Know what? If we're gonna make dinner,
we're gonna have to leave.

116
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,237
So you have a big work problem?

117
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,430
Yeah. It's, uh...

118
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,750
Yeah, it's, uh...

119
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,515
You know, it's nothing.

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,919
Okay.

121
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,999
So I think I'm gonna take off.

122
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,551
No, wait, Joey, it is.
It's something. It's...

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,233
It's my boss.

124
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,348
- Yeah?
- Yeah. And, uh...

125
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,791
And my baby.

126
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,439
My boss wants to buy my baby.

127
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,396
What? Oh, my God!

128
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,632
I know, I told you,
it's a really big problem!

129
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,435
- He wants to buy your baby?
- Can you believe that?

130
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,239
- That's crazy.
- That's what I told him!

131
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,949
- How did this even happen?
- Well, I'll tell you.

132
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,669
See, my boss and his wife,
they can't have children, so...

133
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,116
And then when we were
at the Christmas party...

134
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,717
...he got drunk and said to me,
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."

135
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,159
When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby...

136
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,073
...I figured it was
about maternity leave.

137
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,232
Oh. Yeah.

138
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,599
Yeah, that would have been
a much simpler problem.

139
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,753
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.

140
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,873
I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

141
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,794
Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson.
I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.

142
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,633
- We've seen each other a lot lately.
- Yes.

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,476
Maybe we'll see each other at
dinner tomorrow. Around 8:00?

144
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,473
Well, maybe we will.

145
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,473
Mona?

146
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,760
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be?

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,073
I am so sorry I spilled wine
all over your shirt.

148
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,276
- It's okay.
- No, it's still wet.

149
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,797
Let me get it out before it sets.
I have something you could wear.

150
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,232
Here.

151
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,556
I don't know if I want to wear
a woman's shirt.

152
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,955
- That's a man's shirt.
- Awfully pink.

153
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,917
It's not pink!

154
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,714
Honey, we are so meant
to be together.

155
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,113
- We both have the Annie soundtrack.
- Honey, both yours.

156
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,112
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.

157
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,510
- The work problem?
- It was perfect.

158
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,830
It felt like he was my friend.

159
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,755
- What problem did you say you have?
- Oh, that's not important.

160
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,754
The point is,
I think everything's gonna be okay.

161
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,953
May I help you?

162
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,590
You think you can just buy
my friend's baby?

163
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,989
Isn't it funny how we kept meeting?
It's as if someone wants us together.

164
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,475
Someone does. Me.

165
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,793
Witty banter. Well done. Good.

166
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,999
- Tell me a little bit about yourself.
- Okay. I'm a masseuse.

167
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,676
- And I used to work at this place...
- Do you like to party?

168
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,636
I like parties.

169
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,189
You're wild, aren't you?

170
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,076
- Yeah, I guess. A little.
- Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.

171
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,510
So anyway...

172
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,794
...I've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, I guess...

173
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,032
...for, well, since I was 14.

174
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,509
I'm sorry. I'm staring.

175
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,593
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

176
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,795
Oh, stop it.

177
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,349
And your breasts!

178
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,679
Okay.

179
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,593
Look, you're coming on
a little strong.

180
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,558
I'll give you the benefit
of the doubt.

181
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,109
The universe wants us
to be together.

182
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,239
Why don't we start over?
You can tell me about yourself.

183
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,231
- All right.
- Okay.

184
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,233
I write erotic novels...

185
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,879
...for children.

186
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,908
- What?
- They're wildly unpopular.

187
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,551
Oh, my God!

188
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,439
Also, you might like to know
I have a Ph.D.

189
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,353
- Wow! You do?
- Yep. A pretty huge...

190
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,873
All right.

191
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,151
- Hey.
- Joey, honey, listen.

192
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,756
Thanks for talking to me yesterday.
It meant a lot.

193
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,070
Not a problem.
Just so you know...

194
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,552
...that guy won't be bothering
you about that baby thing anymore.

195
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,959
- What?
- Let's just say I took care of it.

196
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,870
Let's say more.

197
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,189
Don't worry.

198
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,078
I told him, very nicely:

199
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,949
"You don't go buying people's babies!
So back off!"

200
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,270
- What?
- What?

201
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,509
No, no, no!

202
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,752
He doesn't want to buy my baby!
I made that up!

203
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,070
What? Why?

204
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,278
So we would have something
to talk about!

205
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,079
And you couldn't think
of anything else?

206
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,676
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?

207
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,072
You yelled at my boss!
I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do?

208
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,959
You could always sell your baby.

209
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,914
I can't believe you brought
my boss into it! I'll be fired!

210
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,913
- You lied to me!
- Well, she told me to!

211
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,357
Chandler has two copies of Annie!

212
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,789
Oh, my God!

213
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,756
- Ross!
- Hello!

214
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,039
What are you doing?

215
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,877
Not touching myself, if that makes
anyone less uncomfortable.

216
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,549
Morning. You wanted to see me?

217
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,473
Please, come in. Have a seat.

218
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,592
- Look, Mr. Zelner...
- It's best I speak first.

219
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,909
Yeah.

220
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,430
Lee from human resources is here
as a witness to our conversation.

221
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,033
Oh, God.

222
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,910
If I in any way implied
that I wanted to buy your baby...

223
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,191
...I am sorry. Okay?

224
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,796
Last week, when I asked you
when your due date was...

225
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,114
...I certainly did not mean that
I felt that I was "due" your baby.

226
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,310
I want to be very clear...

227
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,677
...that I understand
that it's your baby...

228
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,550
...and it is not mine to purchase.

229
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,590
Well, as long as we are clear
about that.

230
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,669
There it is.

231
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,115
- Not your regular cleaners.
- I know.

232
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,352
That creep goes there.
I had to find a new one.

233
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,150
I have to find a new bank,
adult bookstore, grocery store...

234
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,359
- What?
- A new grocery store.

235
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,756
The universe said I'd meet a nice guy.
I got that?

236
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,639
When I get up there,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

237
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,839
You'll meet someone. If I can meet
a great guy, so can you.

238
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,754
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

239
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,919
- You didn't have to come in.
- You kidding?

240
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,835
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.

241
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,278
I'm gonna be over here watching
the dance of the clean shirts.

242
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,354
Excuse me.
I think you dropped...

243
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,911
- Wow!
- What?

244
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,594
Sorry.
You're just so incredibly beautiful.

245
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,719
Well, I'm sorry about that too.
But what are you gonna do?

246
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,190
Don't think I'm crazy,
but I was meant to pick this up.

247
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,114
- Do you believe in that kind of thing?
- A little.

248
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,311
Now you're talking.

249
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,999
- Want to go for coffee?
- I'd love to. Let me tell my friend.

250
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,436
An ink stain!
Can I watch how you get this out?

251
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,591
She must have left.

252
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,512
- So? What happened?
- It's all gonna be okay.

253
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,515
They're so happy I'm not suing, I got
an extra month paid maternity leave.

254
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,759
So long as I understand the money
should not be construed...

255
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,117
...as a down payment on this
or any other child.

256
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,999
Ralph Lauren is going
out of their way...

257
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,470
...to show they're not
in the baby-buying business.

258
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,316
- Give us a minute?
- Kicking me out of my living room?

259
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,437
Yeah.

260
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,638
I'll be in there.

261
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,199
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I was just trying to make things...

262
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,635
I know. I know.

263
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,034
It kind of worked.

264
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,637
I don't know about you,
but I haven't thought about our thing.

265
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,472
Yeah, you're right.

266
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,835
Yeah. It's kind of been
like "us" again, a little bit.

267
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,117
- Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
- Me too.

268
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,716
I haven't thought about
how I put myself out there...

269
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,509
...and said that stuff.
How you didn't feel the same...

270
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,514
...and how it was really awkward.

271
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,797
My gynecologist tried to kill me.

272
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,355
Item J437-A.

273
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,398
Color: winterberry.

274
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,154
Hi, listen.
Come here. Come...

275
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,710
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.

276
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,556
Listen, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.

277
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,872
- You do?
- Yeah. You still have feelings for me.

278
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,635
To be honest,
I still have feelings for you.

279
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,439
I wish we could work out,
but we can't.

280
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,549
It's too complicated with you and
Rachel and the baby. I just...

281
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,712
It just wasn't meant to be.

282
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,912
Oh, God. You're right.

283
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,114
Ross, we have to be strong.

284
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,395
Okay, I'm gonna go.

285
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,951
Can I? To remember you?

286
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,672
No.

{90}{184}Is it okay if I bring someone|to your parents' anniversary?
{189}{214}- Sure.|- Yeah.
{219}{297}- Who's the guy?|- Parker, we met at the cleaners.
{312}{402}Did he put a little starch|in your bloomers?
{441}{489}Who said that?
{497}{616}No, he's really great, though.|He has this incredible zest for life.
{622}{760}He treats me like a queen. Except|when he treats me like a naughty girl.
{789}{858}Would it be okay if I give the toast?
{867}{933}Even after what happened|at their 20th?
{938}{1047}- I'd really like to.|- Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.
{1052}{1181}Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,|and it always makes them cry.
{1186}{1322}- This year, I'm gonna make them cry.|- You wonder why Ross is their favorite?
{1327}{1450}Any time Ross makes a toast, everyone|cries and pats him on the back.
{1456}{1568}And they all come up to me and say,|"God, your brother."
{1574}{1678}You know what they're gonna say|this year? "God, you."
{1715}{1786}Well, at least one|person will be crying.
{1790}{1892}I'm an actor, and any actor|worth his salt can cry on cue.
{1897}{1995}- Really? You can do that?|- Oh, you kidding me? Watch.
{2232}{2315}Well, I can't do it|with you guys watching me!

{3285}{3366}- What are you doing?|- I'm working on my toast.
{3371}{3455}Or as I like to call it:|"Sob-fest 2002."
{3484}{3536}- Hey, check this out.|- It's a dog.
{3541}{3603}It's a dead dog.
{3608}{3679}Chi-Chi. She died|when I was in high school.
{3684}{3777}- You're talking about a dead pet?|- It's good stuff, huh?
{3872}{3946}Joey? You got a present|for my parents?
{3951}{4066}In honor of their 35th anniversary,|I had a star named after them.
{4072}{4220}- That is so cool.|- And I got "Kama Sutra for the Elderly."
{4237}{4305}- Do you guys have any extra ribbon?|- Sure.
{4310}{4467}What do you need? We got lace,|satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt...
{4490}{4560}And I think my testicles|may be in here too.
{4641}{4758}Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog.
{4763}{4873}Monica couldn't get braces|because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
{4901}{5023}- What?|- You're the 200-pounder that rode her!
{5107}{5195}Hey! Everybody, this is Parker.|Parker, this is...
{5201}{5320}No, don't tell me. Let me guess:|Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel...
{5325}{5415}...and I'm sorry,|Phoebe didn't mention you.
{5429}{5512}Chandler, I'm kidding!|Already you're my favorite.
{5517}{5635}- Tell me a little about yourselves.|- Actually, we should get going.
{5681}{5716}Classic Ross!
{5779}{5863}Rachel, look how you glow! May I?
{5877}{5924}I think you already are.
{5929}{6012}Rachel, you have life|growing inside you.
{6022}{6153}Is there anything more miraculous...|A picture of a dog! Whose is this?
{6193}{6267}That's my old dog.|He passed away years ago.
{6272}{6418}Well, at least you were lucky to have|him. Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.
{6470}{6551}- So where's the party?|- It's in Massapequa.
{6557}{6693}Massapequa, it sounds magical. Is it|steeped in Native American history?
{6698}{6783}Well, there is an Arby's|in the shape of a tepee.
{6789}{6853}I got my notes. You got the presents?
{6859}{6955}- I've got the car keys.|- We're driving? Aces.
{7021}{7121}- So he seems like a nice guy.|- Yeah, I like him a lot.
{7127}{7245}- You want to hang back and take a cab?|- Okay, otherwise I'm not going.
{7449}{7530}- Hey, Mom.|- This is such a great party!
{7540}{7658}Thirty-five years. Impressive.|Do you have any pearls of wisdom?
{7670}{7785}- Jack?|- Why serve food on such a sharp stick?
{7790}{7875}It's a good question, Dad.|It's a good question.
{7916}{8021}- Congratulations, you two.|- Thank you, we're so excited.
{8026}{8115}And also, congratulations|on your wedding.
{8137}{8230}- Can we talk to you for just a moment?|- Yeah.
{8268}{8309}It's just a little thing.
{8314}{8455}While we think it's marvelous you're|having this baby out of wedlock...
{8469}{8538}...our friends are less open-minded.
{8544}{8605}- We told them you're married.|- What?
{8610}{8670}Thanks for going along with this.
{8696}{8802}- We have to pretend that we're married?|- I had to shave my ears.
{8807}{8838}You can do this.
{8880}{8931}- Can you believe that?|- I know.
{8937}{9041}If you do the ears, you may as well|take a pass at the nose.
{9046}{9125}I don't want to have to lie|about being married.
{9130}{9224}I don't either. But it's their party,|and it's one night.
{9229}{9291}We don't have to lie.|We won't talk.
{9296}{9376}If it comes up,|we'll smile, we'll nod along...
{9381}{9406}- Ross?|- Rachel?
{9411}{9490}Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.
{9495}{9613}Congratulations on the baby|and on the wedding.
{9647}{9754}- Here's something to start you out.|- How's marriage treating you?
{9769}{9845}- Unbelievable. It's great!|- I love marriage.
{9850}{9884}We'll see you later.
{9889}{9942}- Hey!|- Hi!
{9962}{10035}What a beautiful place.|What a great night.
{10040}{10170}I have to tell you, being here|with all of you in Event Room C...
{10191}{10296}...I feel so lucky. Think of the good|times that happened here.
{10300}{10423}The birthdays, the proms,|the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!
{10447}{10546}None will compare with tonight.|I don't want to forget it.
{10551}{10677}It's like I want to take a mental|picture of you all. Click.
{10696}{10770}I don't think the flash went off.
{10852}{10913}- I'm gonna find the men's room.|- Me too.
{10917}{11076}There is someone with a tranquilizer|gun and a net looking for that man.
{11083}{11199}I have to go too, but I don't|want him complimenting my thing.
{11204}{11272}Glad we weren't in the car.|Did he let up?
{11277}{11380}He called the Long Island|Expressway a "concrete miracle."
{11393}{11463}This room. This night.
{11469}{11611}That waiter! His shoes!|I must take a mental picture!
{11617}{11655}Sorry.
{11742}{11825}Were you guys making fun of Parker?
{11831}{11915}That depends, how much did you hear?
{11941}{12030}He's a little enthusiastic.|What's wrong with that?
{12034}{12106}- It's so much.|- Well, so what? I like him.
{12111}{12211}Do I make fun of the people you date?|Tag, Janice, Mona.
{12217}{12321}No, because friends don't do that.|Do you want my opinion?
{12325}{12481}Your collective dating record reads|like a who's who of human crap!
{12517}{12596}- I feel terrible.|- I know.
{12622}{12668}What was wrong with Mona?
{12811}{12875}- Open it, open it, open it.|- Yeah, baby!
{12881}{12974}So we never got to hear|about your wedding.
{12979}{13125}- We were surprised we weren't invited.|- No, it was a small wedding.
{13129}{13243}But it was beautiful.|It was small, but kind of spectacular.
{13248}{13363}- Where did you have it?|- On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.
{13369}{13494}And Stevie Wonder sang "Isn't She|Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.
{13499}{13595}- Stevie's a family friend.|- Oh, my God. That's amazing.
{13601}{13692}- I'd love to see pictures.|- Yeah, so would I.
{13697}{13830}You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz|would forget to put film in the camera.
{13862}{13922}Would you excuse us for a second?
{14016}{14140}- What are you doing?|- What? This may be my only wedding.
{14161}{14251}- And I want it to be amazing.|- Okay.
{14257}{14361}- Maybe I rode in on a Harley.|- Ross, it has to be realistic.
{14482}{14581}Say, are you okay?|You seem kind of quiet.
{14586}{14723}- No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.|- And I'm with you. What a great time!
{14759}{14830}Look at this plate bouncy thing.
{14855}{14960}What an inspired solution to man's|plate-dispensing problems.
{14973}{15053}Oysters! Let me feed you.|That's not necessary.
{15058}{15094}- Please?|- I don't eat...
{15099}{15180}- I won't quit until you try one.|- Okay, fine.
{15242}{15317}- Good.|- What're they like? I've never had one.
{15365}{15421}- Try one.|- They look too weird.
{15502}{15615}- What are you doing?|- Going over my toast.
{15620}{15744}I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,|they'll be fighting for breath.
{15752}{15860}If you want to, I could just|hold them down and you could just...
{15886}{16008}And my veil was lace,|made by blind Belgian nuns.
{16013}{16096}- Blind?|- Not at first, but it's intricate work.
{16102}{16204}They said even though they lost|their sight, it was worth it.
{16214}{16295}- I bet you looked beautiful.|- Well, I don't know.
{16301}{16420}But there were some people that said|I looked like a floating angel.
{16430}{16541}- How did you propose?|- Oh, yeah, that's a great story.
{16567}{16668}Well, actually, I took her|to the planetarium.
{16677}{16765}That's where we had our first date.
{16775}{16884}I had the room filled with lilies,|her favorite flower.
{16900}{16990}- That is so sweet!|- I want to hear the rest!
{17027}{17145}Then Fred Astaire singing,|"The Way You Look Tonight" came on...
{17150}{17221}...the lights came down,|I got on one knee...
{17227}{17331}...and written across the dome,|in the stars, were the words:
{17337}{17400}"Will you marry me?"
{17422}{17519}And the ring was the size of my fist.
{17552}{17630}Hey, Phoebe? Look...
{17667}{17755}...I want to apologize. Okay?|We were being jerks.
{17761}{17858}- Parker's nice, I'd like to know him.|- You better do it now.
{17863}{17922}- Why?|- Because I'm gonna kill him.
{17927}{18040}- What?|- He's too excited about everything.
{18045}{18150}I'm all for living, but this is|the Gellers' 35th anniversary.
{18155}{18228}Let's call a spade a spade.|This party stinks.
{18232}{18279}I'm having the worst time.
{18283}{18383}There was a line for the buffet,|and when I got to the plates...
{18388}{18465}...I slipped on a giant booger.
{18516}{18591}Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
{18611}{18680}It could've been.|I didn't look at it.
{18686}{18781}I wiped it on Chandler's coat|and got the hell out.
{18787}{18881}I thought he was a great guy.|I was so excited about him.
{18886}{18968}Well, hey, you should|be excited about him.
{18974}{19030}There's nothing wrong with him.
{19035}{19083}- You think?|- Yeah, know what?
{19088}{19178}- We were all just being too negative.|- You're right.
{19184}{19305}He's just embracing life. We could|all stand to be more like Parker.
{19309}{19396}You know what? I'm like him!|I'm a positive person!
{19406}{19479}- Actually, you have an edge.|- What's that?
{19530}{19596}- Oh, it's Parker!|- Look, the Bunny Hop!
{19602}{19641}- Oh, I love it!|- You do?
{19646}{19759}Are you kidding? People acting|like animals to music? Come on!
{19805}{19870}Okay, it's time for the toast.
{19874}{19989}I know normally Ross gives the toast,|but this year I'll do it.
{20022}{20107}No, it's gonna be great. Really.
{20127}{20161}Okay.
{20167}{20271}Mom, Dad, when I got married...
{20277}{20422}...the thing that made me sure I could|do it was the example you two set.
{20437}{20525}For that, and other things,|I want to thank you.
{20530}{20625}I know I probably don't|say it enough...
{20636}{20685}...but I love you.
{20946}{21104}When I look around, I'm saddened by the|thought of those who could not be here.
{21112}{21240}Nana, my beloved grandmother,|who would so want to be here.
{21247}{21291}But she can't...
{21297}{21336}...because she's dead.
{21427}{21497}As is our dog, Chi-Chi.
{21546}{21618}I mean, look how cute she is... was.
{21680}{21742}Do me a favor,|pass this to my parents.
{21747}{21869}Remember she's dead, okay?|Her and Nana, gone.
{21961}{22005}Wow!
{22122}{22168}Does anybody remember when...
{22174}{22307}...Debra Winger had to say goodbye to|her children in "Terms of Endearment"?
{22342}{22378}Didn't see that?
{22400}{22461}No movie fans?!
{22504}{22555}You want to hear something sad?
{22561}{22663}I was watching a "60 Minutes"|piece on orphans in Romania...
{22669}{22790}...who have been so neglected|that they were incapable of love.
{22920}{23000}You people are made of stone!
{23005}{23085}Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!
{23237}{23321}Thank you, Monica.|That was interesting.
{23327}{23440}- Wasn't it interesting, Jack?|- Why don't I remember this dog?
{23496}{23573}Ross? Why don't you give us|your toast now?
{23578}{23671}Oh, no, Mom.|It's just Monica this year.
{23677}{23782}You're not saying anything?|On our 35th wedding anniversary?
{23817}{23860}No, of course.
{23927}{24060}Everybody? I just wanted to say...
{24066}{24142}...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel...
{24221}{24315}...and myself, that if...
{24332}{24463}...if in 35 years, we're half|as happy as you guys are...
{24469}{24570}...we'll count ourselves|the luckiest people in the world.
{24582}{24629}Oh, Ross.
{24702}{24813}I just wish Nana were alive|to hear Ross' toast.
{24971}{25065}My God, what a fantastically|well-lit hallway.
{25088}{25210}Can I get you something to drink,|like a water and Valium?
{25217}{25318}I must say, this apartment,|it's... there are no words.
{25323}{25386}- Thank God.|- It's a haven.
{25392}{25519}- A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.|- Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.
{25524}{25678}Listen, why don't we just sit and|relax, just be with each other quietly.
{25693}{25740}That sounds great.
{25759}{25853}This is the most comfortable couch|I've ever sat on.
{25859}{25928}Let's try something.|Let's play a game.
{25933}{26000}- I love games.|- Shocking.
{26012}{26095}Let's play the game of...
{26110}{26195}...who can stay quiet the longest.
{26211}{26248}Or Jenga.
{26276}{26430}Let's play this one first, and|remember, whoever talks first loses.
{26512}{26620}- I lose, now Jenga.|- Oh, my God.
{26644}{26721}- Is something wrong?|- You know the word "wrong"?
{26725}{26788}Everything isn't perfect or magical?
{26794}{26883}Everything isn't aglow|with the light of fairies?
{26889}{27045}- They were just brake lights, Parker!|- Excuse me for seeing good in traffic.
{27064}{27141}You don't have to put|a good spin on everything!
{27146}{27260}- I'm sorry. I'm a positive person.|- No, I'm a positive person.
{27266}{27365}You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.
{27372}{27458}At Disneyland, getting laid!
{27481}{27579}You want me to be negative?|You want me to be less happy?
{27584}{27633}Much less happy.
{27642}{27737}Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,|"I better be going."
{27784}{27831}So long!
{27840}{27964}Don't let the "best door in the world"|hit you in the ass on your way out.
{28059}{28170}Isn't this the most incredible fight|you've had in your life?
{28234}{28382}We could've gone from the ceremony to|the reception with you in the sidecar.
{28387}{28432}It just isn't feasible.
{28437}{28571}But a dove placing the ring on your|finger would've been no problem.
{28606}{28731}- It was fun being married to you.|- Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.
{28769}{28853}- Okay, Ross, can I ask you something?|- Yeah.
{28859}{28970}- That proposal at the planetarium?|- I know, I know. It was stupid.
{28975}{29117}Are you kidding? With the lilies,|and the song and the stars?
{29121}{29243}It was really wonderful.|Did you just make that up?
{29262}{29326}I thought of it|when we were going out.
{29332}{29445}That's how I imagined|I would ask you to marry me.
{29467}{29505}Wow.
{29527}{29635}Well, that would've been|very hard to say no to.
{29706}{29837}It's a good thing I didn't do it, it|sounds like a very expensive wedding.
{29986}{30075}- Okay, good night.|- Good night.
{30152}{30249}Even if the sidecar had a windscreen|to protect your hair?
{30254}{30334}- I will think about it.|- That's all I'm asking.
{30425}{30480}Okay, that's it. I give up.
{30485}{30572}At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,|you give the speech.
{30577}{30667}You know, I don't understand|why they didn't cry.
{30672}{30746}- Come on.|- That stuff you said about true love?
{30752}{30860}You were right. We did learn|a lot from Mom and Dad.
{30866}{30955}That picture of Chi-Chi|with her mischievous grin.
{30961}{31115}And what you said about Nana? Yeah,|she really would've wanted to be there.
{31126}{31185}And you know what?
{31211}{31262}I think she was.
{31297}{31385}Oh, good God, Ross,|how the hell do you do it?

{85}{202}Hi. So I'm doing the "Soap Opera Digest"|crossword puzzle...
{207}{297}...and guess who is the clue|for three down?
{302}{388}"Days of Our Lives" star,|blank Tribbiani."
{393}{463}That's me! I'm blank!
{480}{574}How cool! We know three down!|I'm touching three down.
{579}{619}Yeah, you are, baby.
{624}{718}Three down knows I'm married.|What's three down doing?
{723}{786}Do they call to tell you you're in it?
{791}{879}No. They wanted to do|a profile on me. I said no.
{884}{918}Why'd you say no?
{923}{986}Remember the last interview I did?
{991}{1073}I said I write my own lines,|the writers got mad...
{1078}{1191}...and I fell down an elevator shaft.|Who knows what I'd say now?
{1196}{1308}If only there was something|in your head to control what you say.
{1313}{1387}Come on, you'll keep it|in check this time.
{1392}{1497}The publicity would be good for you.|You deserve that.
{1502}{1635}In the interview, you could mention,|I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."
{1640}{1739}Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?
{1757}{1878}- Okay, don't listen to him. Please?|- Fine, all right, I'll do it.
{1883}{1983}You have to be there to stop me|if I say something stupid.
{1988}{2105}Just then, or all the time?|Because we have jobs, you know?
{2127}{2212}We'll be there the whole time.|Just remember:
{2217}{2295}Gal pal, Rachel Green.
{2312}{2455}I'm gonna be in "Soap Opera Digest"!|And not just in the dumb crossword.
{2460}{2513}Seriously, proud of you.

{3466}{3613}- Thanks for taking the time for this.|- Not at all. Happy to do it.
{3624}{3680}You think we're being obvious?
{3685}{3812}No. We're just four people with|neck problems, who talk like this.
{3817}{3869}It's great that we met here.
{3874}{4018}When people hear the magazine's paying,|they want a big, fancy restaurant.
{4031}{4114}Actually, I didn't know|the magazine was paying.
{4123}{4236}Wouldn't have mattered. I do this|for the fans, not the free food.
{4241}{4301}- Can I get you anything?|- Coffee.
{4306}{4378}And I'll have all the muffins.
{4443}{4504}- Hey.|- We're not talking.
{4509}{4564}Oh, finally.
{4605}{4712}According to your bio,|you've done quite a bit of work.
{4717}{4798}Anything that you're|particularly proud of?
{4849}{4928}{y:i}All you want is a dingle
{4933}{5004}{y:i}What you envy's a shwang
{5010}{5088}{y:i}A thing through which you can tinkle
{5093}{5165}"Or play with", "or simply let hang"
{5517}{5598}{y:i}This ever happen?|{y:i}You want a glass of milk...
{5603}{5680}{y:i}... but these darn cartons|{y:i}are so hard to open!
{5685}{5730}"Boy", "you said it", "Mike."
{5791}{5880}{y:i}- There's gotta be a better way!|"- There is", "Kevin!"
{5885}{5989}{y:i}This is the first time|{y:i}he's ever used this. It's easy.
{6008}{6084}{y:i}- This works in any milk carton.|{y:i}- It is easy.
{6089}{6173}{y:i}Now I can have milk every day.
{6194}{6247}So this is it, Victor?
{6263}{6371}Yeah, I guess it is. And so...
{6408}{6492}...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...
{6644}{6763}...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7|in search of alternative fuels.
{6770}{6926}But when I return 200 years from now,|you'll be long gone.
{6931}{6993}But I won't have aged at all.
{7067}{7189}So you tell your great-great-|granddaughter to look me up.
{7239}{7289}Because, Adrian...
{7295}{7338}...baby...
{7370}{7435}...I'm gonna want to meet her.
{7627}{7709}Here I come.|I'm coming to fix the copier.
{7714}{7823}I can't get to the copier.|I'm thinking, "What do I do?"
{7847}{7977}So I just watch them have sex.|And then I say... Wait, here's my line:
{7982}{8061}"You know", "that's bad"|{y:i}for the paper tray.
{8102}{8184}- Nice work, my friend.|- Wait, you see me again.
{8189}{8263}Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
{8268}{8343}There I am. There I am. There I am.
{8368}{8462}There are so many things,|it's hard to pick just one.
{8478}{8542}I'm getting coffee. Want anything?
{8547}{8648}- A blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.|- Double latte.
{8653}{8738}- A bagel with only...|- I was just being polite.
{8770}{8890}How about when you're not working?|What do you do in your spare time?
{8931}{9050}Look at this clown. He thinks|he can take up the whole river.
{9055}{9138}Get out of the way, jackass!
{9155}{9243}Who names their boat|"Coast Guard", anyway?
{9277}{9322}That is the Coast Guard.
{9327}{9438}What are they doing out here?|The coast is way over there!
{9454}{9501}This is unbelievable.
{9506}{9623}Joey has been holding his breath|for almost four minutes.
{9717}{9787}Dude, are you trying to kill me?
{9928}{10011}Well, I see you've had|a very productive day.
{10016}{10115}- Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?|- Come on, it's fun!
{10188}{10234}All right.
{10390}{10443}Isn't this a woman's hat?
{10448}{10533}Dude, stop talking crazy|and make us some tea.
{10557}{10623}We have to turn off the porn.
{10642}{10703}I think you're right.
{10735}{10777}- All right, ready?|- One.
{10782}{10848}- Two, three.|- Three.
{10942}{10990}That's kind of nice.
{10995}{11051}- It's kind of a relief.|- Yeah.
{11211}{11286}- You wanna see if we still have it?|- Yeah.
{11304}{11368}Free porn! We have free porn here!
{11378}{11453}In my spare time, I read to the blind.
{11458}{11538}And I'm also a mento for kids.
{11558}{11639}- A mento?|- You know, a mento. A role model.
{11710}{11758}- A mento?|- Right.
{11763}{11848}- Like the candy?|- As a matter of fact, I do.
{11904}{12043}Our readers always want to know how|soap stars stay in such great shape.
{12048}{12106}Do you have a fitness regime?
{12111}{12226}We stars usually just try to eat right|and get lots of exercise.
{12240}{12345}You know we've thrown this|without dropping it for an hour?
{12350}{12380}Are you serious?
{12385}{12509}I realized it a half-hour ago,|but I didn't want to jinx it.
{12514}{12600}- Wow, we are pretty good at this.|- Yeah.
{12605}{12673}Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.
{12678}{12762}That's the first time|I've ever missed a meal.
{12767}{12838}My pants are a little loose.
{12863}{12910}What's wrong with you?
{12915}{13035}I got this blinding pain in my stomach|when I was lifting weights.
{13040}{13105}And then I passed out.
{13110}{13234}I haven't been able to stand up since.|But I don't think it's serious.
{13239}{13309}Sounds like a hernia.|Go to the doctor.
{13314}{13344}No way!
{13349}{13484}If I go to the doctor, it's for this|thing sticking out of my stomach!
{13536}{13613}Why'd I have to start|working out again?
{13618}{13681}Damn you, fifteens!
{13686}{13757}- What is it?|- A trifle. It has layers.
{13762}{13843}A layer of ladyfingers,|then a layer of jam.
{13848}{13926}Then custard,|which I made from scratch.
{13931}{14046}Raspberries, more ladyfingers,|beef sauteed with peas and onions.
{14051}{14121}Then a little bit more custard.
{14136}{14196}It tastes like feet.
{14242}{14299}I like it.
{14365}{14462}- Are you kidding?|- What's not to like? Custard, good.
{14467}{14539}Jam, good. Meat, good!
{14599}{14669}Well, you don't look good, Joe.
{14697}{14791}Well, the fridge broke,|so I had to eat everything.
{14796}{14859}Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
{14864}{14929}Hey, what was in that brown jar?
{14934}{15004}- That's still in there?|- Not anymore.
{15009}{15076}This piece doesn't have floor on it.
{15081}{15168}- Stick to your side.|- Hey, come on, now.
{15424}{15484}All right, what are we having?
{15591}{15719}I don't believe in these crazy diets.|Just everything in moderation.
{15724}{15767}Your muffins.
{15804}{15866}I'll take those to go.
{15871}{15903}For the kids.
{15951}{16004}I know what I wanted to ask.
{16009}{16105}They killed you off years ago.|What happened there?
{16110}{16214}I said some stuff in an interview|I shouldn't have said.
{16219}{16320}- But that is not gonna happen today.|- Understood.
{16325}{16419}- So, what'd you say back then?|- I said that l...
{16424}{16495}- Hey, Joey!|- How you doing?
{16598}{16715}This is Shelly. She's interviewing me.|Shelly, these are my friends.
{16720}{16840}Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.|If you want the dirt, come to me.
{16845}{16938}This might be Joey's baby, who knows?
{16949}{17052}I'm just kidding.|Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.
{17057}{17158}Who just lost the respect|of her unborn child.
{17163}{17229}I'm gonna go get this warmed up.
{17234}{17316}- You're doing great.|- So far, nothing stupid.
{17321}{17370}- Mento?|- No, thanks.
{17422}{17542}As Joey's friends, is there anything|our readers should know?
{17547}{17619}No, just that he is a great guy.
{17624}{17695}That'll get you|into "Soap Opera Digest."
{17700}{17734}Well, l...
{17739}{17791}I'd like to say that Joey...
{17796}{17909}...truly has enriched|the days of our lives.
{17922}{18030}I think that you don't expect|someone so hot to be so sweet.
{18035}{18145}- I like that. What's your name?|- Phoebe Buffay.
{18150}{18276}- How do you spell that?|- It's P as in Phoebe. H as in Heebie.
{18281}{18335}O as in Obie. E as in Ebie.
{18340}{18460}B as in Beebee.|And E as in, "'ello there, mate!"
{18468}{18534}Great. It was nice meeting you.
{18539}{18606}- Yeah, you too.|- Thanks.
{18623}{18733}It seems you have a lot of friends.|Who is your best friend?
{18826}{18883}How come you have two?
{18904}{18959}Well, this one's for you.
{18964}{19032}- Get out!|- No, I can't.
{19067}{19188}I know how much this means to you.|This isn't just about jewelry.
{19193}{19318}It's about you and me|and the fact that we're best buds.
{19350}{19439}Is this friendship? I think so!
{19444}{19514}Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!
{19519}{19580}That's what they'll call us!
{19634}{19726}- I'm sorry.|- It's all right. Don't worry about it.
{19731}{19791}That's gonna leave a stain.
{19796}{19892}Rach, hey, it's fine.|You're at Joey's.
{19905}{19968}- Really?|- Yeah, look.
{20099}{20180}- I've never lived like this before.|- I know!
{20266}{20363}Well, don't waste it.|I mean, it's still food. Jeez!
{20377}{20452}I feel guilty.|I wanna be a good friend...
{20457}{20573}...and damn it, I am a good friend.|So shut up and close your eyes.
{20696}{20746}You are a good friend.
{20751}{20843}The audition was this morning,|and I didn't get it.
{20861}{20986}But that was a hell of a kiss.|Rachel is a very lucky girl.
{21040}{21143}Let's get the contestants|out of their isolation booths.
{21148}{21193}And they're off!
{21206}{21277}Get your foot off my contestant!|Judge!
{21282}{21346}Judge rules: No violation.
{21359}{21489}- The duck gets the Nutter Butter!|- No! That's just an old won ton.
{21495}{21581}Judge rules: Nutter Butter!
{21588}{21640}Tough call.
{21649}{21788}- I saw it on the Discovery Channel.|- Wait a minute. I saw that!
{21793}{21864}Yeah, about jellyfish,|and how if you...
{21976}{22031}You peed on yourself?
{22065}{22146}You can't say that! You don't know!
{22151}{22225}I thought I'd pass out from the pain.
{22230}{22338}Anyway, I tried,|but I couldn't bend that way.
{22400}{22443}So...
{22576}{22654}That's right, I stepped up!
{22704}{22779}She's my friend and she needed help!
{22784}{22871}If I had to,|I'd pee on any one of you!
{22960}{23023}Nope. No best friend.
{23028}{23098}Just a lot of close friends.
{23108}{23183}So now back to the show.
{23188}{23289}How does it feel|to have a huge gay fan base?
{23294}{23346}Really? Me?
{23352}{23452}Wow, I don't even know|any huge gay people.
{23457}{23544}It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
{23554}{23658}Now, off the record, you're not...
{23671}{23762}What? Are you referring|to my man's bag?
{23779}{23863}At first, it just looked good,|but it's practical.
{23868}{23967}It's got compartments for stuff:|Your wallet, your keys.
{23972}{24025}Your makeup.
{24045}{24140}Should I climb down your front|so we're face to face...
{24145}{24278}...or should I climb down your back|so we're butt to face?
{24288}{24348}- I think face is best.|- Yeah, face.
{24371}{24453}- Okay, here I come.|- All right.
{24515}{24604}Oh, my...|How much do you weigh, Ross?
{24610}{24737}I prefer not to answer that. I'm still|carrying a little holiday weight.
{24910}{25052}When we said "face to face," we didn't|think it all the way through!
{25057}{25106}- Hey, Pheebs.|- Hey!
{25164}{25213}Check it out.
{25330}{25398}How much of a man am I?
{25404}{25513}Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.
{25521}{25575}You're turning into a woman.
{25585}{25708}No, I'm not! Why would you say that?|That's just mean!
{25738}{25803}Now I've upset you? What did I say?
{25808}{25899}Not what you said,|it's just the way you said it.
{25904}{25978}Oh, my God! I'm a woman!
{26192}{26276}- Great nap.|- It really was.
{26599}{26654}Me? Gay? No. No. No.
{26660}{26743}But I have a number|of close friends who are.
{26805}{26853}So let's talk about women.
{26858}{26952}I'm sure our female readers are|interested in your romantic life.
{26957}{27047}What I do is, I look a woman|up and down and I say:
{27052}{27142}"Hey. How you doing?"
{27192}{27231}Oh, please.
{27237}{27308}Hey. How you doing?
{27415}{27481}Hey. How you doing?
{27486}{27555}He has an amazing Porsche under there.
{27561}{27670}I'd love to show you, but I just|tucked her in. She's sleeping.
{27675}{27758}Would you two girls|like to go for a drink?
{27895}{27980}- Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.|- Oh, my God! Jill!
{27985}{28035}- Oh, my God! Rachel!|- Oh, hi!
{28040}{28142}- Oh, my God! Introduce us!|- Well, this is Chandler.
{28147}{28240}You know Monica and Ross.|That's Phoebe. That's Joey.
{28245}{28323}- Hey, how you doing?|- Don't!
{28383}{28505}You're a really nice guy. I'm happy|to be your roommate and friend.
{28510}{28634}I'm just... You know, I just|don't feel that way about you.
{28689}{28751}I see what happened.
{28756}{28843}It's because I was trying|to repel you. Right?
{28848}{28978}Believe me, you'd feel|a lot different if I turned it on.
{28983}{29053}- I don't think so.|- Oh, I do.
{29105}{29156}How you doing?
{29202}{29247}I'm okay.
{29255}{29328}What? Oh, dear God!
{29424}{29508}Not much to tell there.|I'm really shy.
{29569}{29637}So that's it.|I guess that's all I need.
{29642}{29742}Thank you so much.|I think they'll run this next month.
{29747}{29820}Oh, great. Great. Thank you.
{29825}{29883}- Bye.|- Bye-bye.
{29903}{29967}- I did it.|- Amazing.
{29972}{30072}Wait, I almost forgot.|We have to ask everybody this:
{30077}{30162}Other than "Days",|what's your favorite soap opera?
{30167}{30306}Oh, I don't watch soap operas.|Excuse me? I have a life, you know?
{30339}{30458}The readers at "Soap Opera Digest"|will be happy to learn that.
{30463}{30503}Good enough.
{30592}{30632}So close.
{30750}{30851}They didn't put in the part|about you not watching soaps.
{30856}{30968}I called the lady and said I|was joking. She was nice about it.
{30973}{31051}- You slept with her, didn't you?|- A little bit.
{31093}{31151}This picture of you is steamy.
{31156}{31262}That's just a little something|for my huge gay fan base.
{31267}{31373}- Did you just wink at me?|- You're the one who loves the picture.

{193}{277}So, what's the final head count|on my baby shower?
{282}{348}Twenty. Some work people|had things to do.
{353}{400}Your sisters can't make it.
{405}{469}They're not coming|to a social event...
{473}{575}...where there's no men and no booze?|That's shocking.
{581}{627}As long as my mom's here.
{637}{727}- Oh, my God. Your mother.|- My mom's not gonna be here?
{731}{843}Given we forgot to invite her, it'd|be a big coincidence if she was.
{853}{901}My God!
{906}{972}Phoebe was in charge|of the invitations.
{976}{1042}I don't have a mother.|Often I forget...
{1047}{1103}Oh, give it a rest.
{1110}{1185}So my mother is not coming|to my baby shower?

{1233}{1301}Neither is mine.
{1306}{1413}We'll take care of it. We'll call her.|You go home and get ready.
{1417}{1502}Make sure she comes.|It's important. It's my mom.
{1507}{1581}- I know. What's her number?|- I don't know.
{1586}{1658}Go. I have it in my book. Go.
{1792}{1887}If you're in charge of invitations,|why am I calling her?
{1891}{1965}Hello, Mrs. Green!|Hi, it's Monica Geller.
{1970}{2009}- Oh, hello, Monica.|{y:i}- Hi.
{2014}{2107}It's last-minute, but we've decided|to throw an impromptu...
{2112}{2206}...baby shower for Rachel today.|- My daughters told me...
{2210}{2322}...when they received their impromptu|invitations a month ago.
{2326}{2412}- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.|"- For what", "dear?"
{2417}{2490}For not inviting me,|or for lying about it?
{2494}{2592}Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.
{2609}{2709}Please, please, can you come?|It starts at 4:00.
{2715}{2820}- Well, all right. I'll see you at 4:00.|- Thank you.
{2826}{2945}- Isn't it at 3:00?|- Son of a bitch!

{3870}{3914}Hey! Wanna shoot some hoops?
{3920}{4017}I'm practicing for an audition|to be host of a game show.
{4022}{4047}- Cool!|- Great!
{4052}{4128}If I get it, by day,|I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.
{4132}{4229}But by night, I'll be Joey Tribbiani!
{4244}{4331}You'd be perfect! That's your name!
{4342}{4423}The audition's soon,|and I don't understand the game.
{4430}{4461}Do you want help?
{4466}{4577}Oh, really? That'd be great.|Hey, you guys can be the contestants!
{4582}{4664}We can lose to junior-high girls|some other time.
{4678}{4768}- All right. Let's play Bamboozled!|- Bamboozled?
{4773}{4823}- Isn't that a cool name?|- Yeah!
{4827}{4939}All right. Okay.|Our first contestant is Ross Geller.
{4943}{4996}Tell us about yourself, Ross.
{5000}{5113}Well, I'm a paleontologist.|I live in New York.
{5117}{5235}I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And...
{5242}{5322}I said, "a little bit."|How about you, Chandler?
{5326}{5423}I'm a headhunter. I hook up|out-of-work Soviet scientists...
{5427}{5506}...with rogue Third World nations.|Hi, Rasputin.
{5511}{5599}Excellent! Let's play!|Chandler, you'll go first.
{5603}{5671}- What is the capital of Colombia?|- Bogota.
{5676}{5749}It's Bogota, but close enough.
{5774}{5883}You can either pass your turn to Ross|or pick a Wicked Wango Card.
{5888}{5985}- What does a Wicked Wango Card do?|- I should know that.
{6013}{6069}Let's see. One moment, please...
{6073}{6224}Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card|determines if you go higher or lower.
{6228}{6284}Higher or lower than what?
{6303}{6416}- This is embarrassing!|- Can you believe how lame this is?
{6420}{6549}I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants|are allowed to talk to each other.
{6637}{6733}I told the stripper to be here at 5.|That's good, right?
{6763}{6842}You ordered a stripper?|That is inappropriate.
{6847}{6914}Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.
{6942}{7029}Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.|I'm so glad you could make it.
{7034}{7148}Thank you so much. We're so sorry.|We could not feel worse about it.
{7152}{7190}Try.
{7219}{7261}There's my little girl!
{7278}{7329}- She's still mad.|- Yeah, I know.
{7333}{7422}Isn't it great? One less|person to make small talk with.
{7428}{7513}Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.|It doesn't bother you?
{7518}{7607}We've apologized twice.|I can't do any more than that.
{7611}{7677}You hate it when people|are mad at you...
{7681}{7756}...but you just have|to be okay with it.
{7760}{7840}Okay. I can do that.
{7844}{7923}- I gotta go powder my ass.|- Oh.
{7929}{8002}That face! Like when|you were in high school.
{8006}{8112}If I didn't know better, I'd say|you're a cheerleader in trouble.
{8116}{8157}Come, let's get some tea.
{8161}{8237}Oh, my! Look at that.|Only three weeks to go.
{8241}{8355}Did you pick a nanny? If you use your|maid, it will split her focus.
{8359}{8470}Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.|And I don't have a maid.
{8475}{8547}It's like you're a cave person.
{8557}{8663}You must get a nanny. You don't|know how overwhelming it will be.
{8667}{8746}When you were a baby, I had Mrs. K.
{8751}{8848}Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.|She taught me Spanish.
{8852}{8918}I actually think|I remember some of it:
{8922}{9013}{y:i}Tu madre esta loca.
{9036}{9102}Such a sweet woman.
{9107}{9178}As great as she was,|I can't afford that.
{9183}{9227}- Oh, Rachel!|- What?
{9231}{9326}I just had a great idea!|I'm gonna come live with you!
{9336}{9384}What? What?
{9389}{9501}Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna|do this for my little girl.
{9505}{9588}Look at you.|You have tears in your eyes.
{9626}{9692}Yes, yes, I do.
{9733}{9767}Ross is in the lead.
{9772}{9851}Another question,|or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
{9856}{9946}The Wheel has not been|my friend tonight, Joey.
{9950}{9994}I'll take another question.
{9999}{10051}This is tough. Hold your breath.
{10055}{10098}It's okay. I'm ready.
{10102}{10173}You gotta hold your breath|until you answer.
{10178}{10250}This is ridiculous! He's not gonna...
{10282}{10432}Okay. What do you have a fear of if|you suffer from this phobia? Triska...
{10436}{10535}Holy cow. That's a big word. Tris...
{10539}{10598}Look at this. How do you say that?
{10602}{10676}- Let me see that.|- This one right here.
{10701}{10769}- Triskaidekaphobia.|- Fear of Triscuits!
{10773}{10879}- No! No. Fear of the number 13.|- Fear of Triscuits?
{10884}{10966}It's possible.|They have really sharp edges.
{10999}{11034}Chandler, you're up.
{11039}{11125}I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass|for a free turn.
{11130}{11233}- This game makes no sense!|- You're upset because you're losing.
{11238}{11332}Oh, come on, Ross.|I think we're all losers here.
{11348}{11439}You can either spin the Wheel|or pick a Google Card.
{11443}{11529}Let me think, let me think.|Oh, I don't care.
{11576}{11616}You must choose.
{11620}{11725}- Either. It makes no difference.|- Choose, you jackass.
{11749}{11829}- I'll take a card.|- You picked the Gimme Card!
{11833}{11915}- You get all of Ross' points!|- What?
{11933}{11997}This game is kind of fun!
{12001}{12076}You don't think it's crazy|you get my points...?
{12081}{12176}The contestants aren't supposed|to speak to each other.
{12229}{12312}- Why did you invite my mother?|- What?
{12316}{12395}She wants to move in|and help care for the baby.
{12401}{12457}- For how long?|- Eight weeks.
{12461}{12571}I love my mother, but, my God,|a long lunch with her is taxing.
{12575}{12647}I'd be honored if she wanted|to live with me.
{12652}{12713}She can't hear you.
{12741}{12781}What am I gonna do?
{12786}{12878}If you don't want her to move|in with you, just tell her.
{12882}{12953}You're right.|I'm about to have a baby.
{12957}{13034}I can say I don't want|her sleeping on my couch.
{13038}{13117}She'll wanna sleep in my bed.|This can't happen.
{13122}{13147}That is right.
{13151}{13223}Tell her you don't want her|to live with you.
{13227}{13283}Do not take no for an answer.
{13306}{13418}This is great! Now she's|gonna be mad at Rachel!
{13422}{13545}And I'm just gonna swoop in there and|be like the daughter she never had.
{13559}{13665}I have new respect for Chandler.
{13671}{13774}All right, everybody!|It's time to open the presents!
{13778}{13849}Yes! The first gift|that Rachel opens...
{13854}{13912}...should be from the grandmother.
{13916}{14059}Because you're the most important|person in this room! And in the world!
{14070}{14144}I don't have one|because I was invited late.
{14148}{14269}But thank you so much, dear, for|bringing that to everybody's attention.
{14317}{14427}How about you less important people?|Let's open your presents!
{14450}{14543}- It's okay that you didn't get a gift.|- I kind of did.
{14547}{14604}Me! Eight weeks of me.
{14608}{14700}Okay. See, Mom?|The truth is, I can do this on my own.
{14704}{14771}I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.
{14775}{14845}But you need help at the beginning.
{14850}{14914}I know what I'm doing.|I can handle it.
{14918}{14962}Really? Remember Twinkles?
{14967}{15062}He was a hamster.|I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!
{15066}{15146}Okay, come on, Rach.|It's present time!
{15150}{15222}You're the glue holding|this party together.
{15226}{15305}It's kind of falling apart here.
{15309}{15362}- Oh, look!|- Wow!
{15366}{15411}This is from work friends.
{15415}{15548}Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!|Oh, I know what this is.
{15552}{15596}Wait a minute.
{15600}{15671}That can't be right.
{15686}{15763}Is that a beer bong for a baby?
{15786}{15842}Darling, that's a breast pump.
{15873}{16008}Did I say I was done guessing?|Okay, thank you for that.
{16014}{16075}Oh, wow! What's this?
{16080}{16162}- It's a Diaper Genie.|- It dispenses clean diapers!
{16167}{16216}It's where you put dirty ones.
{16225}{16317}Why don't you take it outside|and throw it in a dumpster?
{16321}{16442}- You're gonna do that 10 times a day?|- What, it goes 10 times a day?
{16446}{16507}Are we feeding this baby Indian food?
{16521}{16587}No, dear. That's what babies do.
{16593}{16697}Rachel, listen to your mother.|She is very smart.
{16723}{16839}What will you do with the baby|while you trot out to the garbage?
{16853}{16939}I don't know,|I'd leave it on the changing table?
{16944}{17064}- What? What did I do? What did I do?|- You can't leave a baby alone.
{17068}{17110}Of course, I know that!
{17114}{17183}Of course you never leave|a baby alone.
{17187}{17245}It would...|She wouldn't be safe.
{17255}{17350}Not as safe as she would be|with me, the baby dummy.
{17354}{17446}Opening the presents is a little|overwhelming right now.
{17450}{17532}I'm gonna maybe open|them all a little bit later.
{17536}{17597}Thank you for coming,|for the gifts...
{17601}{17732}...and this basket is beautiful.|- It's actually a bassinet.
{17738}{17814}Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.
{17894}{17995}In what film is the line:|"We don't need no stinking badges!"
{17999}{18070}"- Treasure of the Sierra Madre"!|- Backwards Bonus.
{18075}{18156}"- Madre Sierra the of Treasure"!|- Yes!
{18167}{18232}I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance!
{18237}{18295}- Wise! How many rungs?|- Six!
{18324}{18430}- That noise can only mean one thing.|- Hungry Monkey!
{18440}{18531}- I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.|- It's an audio question.
{18535}{18625}Name this television theme song:
{18662}{18732}Oh, my God. I know this.|Give me a second.
{18737}{18786}- Tell the Time Turtle!|- Shut up!
{18790}{18841}- "I Dream of Jeannie"!|- Yes!
{18845}{18900}I'd like to spin the Wheel.
{19029}{19082}Oh, come on!
{19086}{19127}Super Speedy Speed Round.
{19131}{19198}- Is there a Hopping Bonus?|- Of course.
{19281}{19335}- Who invented bifocals?|- Franklin!
{19339}{19407}Which monarch ruled|Great Britain the longest?
{19412}{19442}Queen Victoria!
{19447}{19548}You forgot to switch legs between|questions. No Hopping Bonus!
{19552}{19605}Every time!
{19609}{19705}- Yeah. Now over to Chandler.|- I'd like a Google Card.
{19709}{19822}- Are you sure?|- Yes! No! Google!
{19859}{19950}Oh, my God! Congratulations, Ross!|Because, Chandler...
{19954}{20006}...you've been Bamboozled!|- No!
{20011}{20140}- Yes!|- This is the best game ever!
{20158}{20217}You'll stay as long as I need you?
{20221}{20285}- Of course.|- I swear I'm not an idiot.
{20289}{20361}I read books on pregnancy|and giving birth.
{20367}{20469}I didn't think to read about what|to do when the baby comes.
{20473}{20514}And the baby's coming...
{20518}{20640}...and I don't know what to do.|Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?
{20644}{20718}Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
{20727}{20800}- Where you going?|- I'm going to the bathroom.
{20805}{20920}Now, don't worry.|Everything's gonna be okay.
{20940}{20993}It is gonna be okay!
{21092}{21144}Worth a shot.
{21187}{21258}Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
{21264}{21323}I just Bamboozled Chandler!
{21397}{21453}Which is not a sexual thing.
{21501}{21600}- Well, that was a quick shower.|- Not if you were here.
{21611}{21648}We got good stuff.
{21652}{21728}We did. My mom got|us the greatest gift of all.
{21733}{21780}A Play-Doh Barbershop?
{21808}{21907}No. She's going to live|with us for eight weeks.
{21913}{21946}What?
{21951}{22042}Yes! She's gonna help us|take care of the baby!
{22064}{22115}You're not serious!
{22119}{22220}She's a very nice woman,|but we can't take eight weeks of her.
{22224}{22277}- She'll drive us crazy...|- Hi, Ross!
{22281}{22334}Hey, roomie!
{22477}{22553}Hey, I'm Ray.|I'm the producer of the show.
{22558}{22633}It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.
{22637}{22739}This is Duncan and Erin.|They're gonna help with the audition.
{22744}{22840}- Right, Ray.|- Whenever you're ready.
{22845}{22954}Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.|Let's play Bamboozled!
{22959}{23070}Erin, first question. In hockey,|who is known as "The Great One"?
{23075}{23104}- Gretzky.|- Correct!
{23109}{23202}Want to pick a Wicked Wango Card|or spin the Wheel?
{23207}{23284}Didn't your agents give|you the revised rules?
{23288}{23362}We've eliminated all that.|No wheel. No cards.
{23366}{23414}Why?
{23418}{23518}It was too complicated.|People didn't follow it.
{23522}{23618}Complicated?! Spin the Wheel|to go up the Ladder of Chance...
{23622}{23702}...through the Rainbow Ring|to the Golden Monkey.
{23706}{23782}You yank his tail,|and you're in Paradise Pond!
{23797}{23851}Yeah. All that's gone.
{23855}{23929}It's a simple question-|and-answer game now.
{23934}{23987}Well, what's fun about that?
{23991}{24099}You expect me to host a boring game|of people answering questions?
{24104}{24170}Women in bikinis hold up the scores.
{24175}{24245}Let's play Bamboozled!
{24249}{24332}Oh, and all those dinosaur|knickknacks you have...
{24337}{24390}They might be better in the garage.
{24397}{24526}- Well, we don't have a garage.|- Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
{24554}{24674}You know what? Maybe it's not|absolutely vital that you live with us.
{24678}{24811}- Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.|- I really do. I don't know anything.
{24820}{24860}I'm sure that's untrue.
{24865}{24933}Oh, no?|Do I know anything about babies?
{24937}{25011}- No. Not a thing.|- It's frightening.
{25016}{25090}Even if she doesn't|know anything, I do.
{25095}{25180}I have a son. His mother|and I didn't live together.
{25184}{25293}When he was with me, I took|care of him all the time, by myself.
{25297}{25373}- That's true. You do have another child.|- Yeah.
{25377}{25420}With another woman.
{25425}{25505}Have you no control, Ross?
{25553}{25613}That's a different issue.
{25625}{25742}The point is, when the baby comes,|I will be there to feed her...
{25746}{25803}...and bathe her and change her.
{25807}{25887}I want to do all those things.
{25891}{26001}- You don't need me to live with you.|- Yes!
{26019}{26101}Yes. You're gonna be so missed.
{26112}{26209}- You'll be a great father.|- You'll be a wonderful grandma.
{26218}{26314}Hello? I still don't know|what the hell I'm doing!
{26319}{26398}Every first-time mother|feels that way.
{26402}{26546}You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.|Look, when you first came to the city...
{26550}{26678}...you were a spoiled, helpless little|girl who used Daddy's credit cards!
{26688}{26755}I hope you're going|somewhere with this.
{26759}{26827}Look at you.|You're this big executive.
{26832}{26897}You are very capable.
{26902}{27001}I have no doubt you're gonna|be an incredible mother.
{27007}{27082}- Really?|- I'm telling you.
{27104}{27149}Thank you.
{27206}{27264}All right. I'm gonna get going.
{27277}{27325}No, sweetheart, stay put.
{27330}{27452}I'll let myself out. It's like I'm|not here. Which I almost wasn't.
{27477}{27603}You're just so funny. You're so funny.|What do I do?
{27611}{27704}Nothing. You have apologized|to her like a million times.
{27708}{27783}And she's been nothing|but terrible to you.
{27788}{27914}You just threw her daughter a lovely,|albeit slightly boring, shower.
{27918}{28040}- And she hasn't even thanked you for it.|- You know what? You're right.
{28046}{28121}If you wanna say anything,|I'd tell her off.
{28125}{28160}Really?
{28195}{28250}Okay, I will.
{28255}{28311}Mrs. Green?
{28317}{28352}Mrs. Green?
{28356}{28426}It is rude not to say|goodbye to the host.
{28431}{28547}When someone apologizes to you,|the decent thing to do is to accept it.
{28551}{28605}What I did wasn't on purpose.
{28609}{28697}But what you're doing to me now|is plain spiteful.
{28702}{28734}- Spiteful?|- Right.
{28739}{28833}It's time you took a good|look in the mirror, young lady!
{28837}{28879}Old lady!
{28883}{28927}Lady!
{28931}{29000}Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.
{29021}{29180}So whenever you're ready to apologize|to me, I will forgive you. Good day.
{29243}{29295}I can't feel my legs!
{29313}{29383}You were fantastic!|I'm so proud of you.
{29398}{29484}- Yeah? I'm proud of me too.|- You should be.
{29490}{29596}- Could you get me something to drink?|- You got it!
{29600}{29717}Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry!|I apologize. If you...
{29751}{29829}Okay! I bit my tongue!
{29833}{29913}But I'm still really sorry!
{30056}{30106}- Okay, I'm ready.|- You sure?
{30111}{30181}I've done my studying,|and I know my stuff.
{30187}{30238}All right, then.
{30272}{30341}Rachel Green,|let's play Bamboozled!
{30356}{30422}How do you test|bathwater temperature?
{30427}{30477}- Put your elbow in it.|- Good!
{30482}{30586}- How do you let a baby nap?|- Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.
{30590}{30616}Correct!
{30621}{30756}This is an audio question. What do|you do when a baby makes this sound:
{30837}{30899}Check if it's wet or hungry, burp it.
{30904}{31023}Excellent! Now do you want another|question or a Wicked Wango Card?
{31028}{31110}- A card! A card! I pick a card!|- Oh, I'm sorry.
{31114}{31239}You've been Bamboozled!|You're gonna be a terrible mother!
{31286}{31384}I've lost sight of why|we're doing this!

{174}{272}A poster for that WWI movie I'm in.|Check it out.
{277}{340}Wow! It looks really violent!
{344}{419}I know. I'm coming soon|to a theater near you.
{423}{503}I'm in THX.|I'm unsuitable for children!
{511}{604}- I cannot wait to see this.|- It's generating Oscar buzz.
{609}{689}- I started that!|- I thought I did!
{694}{744}I just talked to my agent...
{750}{844}...and the premiere is next week|and you're all invited!
{849}{897}- Will we take a limo?|- Sure!
{906}{996}I love taking limos|when nobody died.
{1001}{1053}Well, I won't be able to come.
{1058}{1188}For those who haven't checked|their calendars, today's my due date.
{1192}{1295}I want to thank you guys|for how great you've been during this.
{1299}{1402}I couldn't have done it without you.|I loved these last 9 months.
{1406}{1461}I'm looking forward|to the next part...
{1471}{1573}...but I am really gonna miss|being pregnant.
{1662}{1744}That's right. Still no baby.
{1748}{1803}Come on, people, make some room.
{1807}{1899}Sweetie, maybe you'd be|more comfortable here.
{1931}{1970}You.
{2035}{2105}Like you haven't done enough.
{2133}{2236}I know you're miserable.|I wish there was something I could do.
{2240}{2322}I wish I were a sea horse.
{2380}{2515}Because with sea horses, it's the male.|They carry the babies.
{2546}{2667}And then also,|I'd be far away in the sea.
{2692}{2892}Ripped by|mrnch@dh.net.mk
{2938}{2976}God.
{2991}{3118}I have never been so uncomfortable|in my entire life.
{3123}{3180}I know. I remember toward the end...
{3185}{3306}That's a great story. Tell it while|you're getting me some iced tea.
{3373}{3473}Oh, God, get out!|Get out, get out, get out!

{3688}{3888}Subtitles processed by|Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004
{4594}{4665}Hey, did you have the baby yet?
{4719}{4804}Do you want me to sit on you?|Because I'll do it.
{4819}{4906}- What are you doing here?|- They sent me home from work.
{4911}{4995}They said, "Start your maternity|leave now. Just rest."
{4999}{5047}You know what? Screw them!
{5051}{5144}If they don't want me there,|I'll hang out with you guys.
{5168}{5249}Or you could do volunteer work.
{5285}{5350}- Hello?|- Joey, it's Estelle.
{5356}{5477}I was able to get you and one guest|tickets to your premiere.
{5482}{5597}- You told me I could have six tickets.|- I sold four on eBay.
{5649}{5716}You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
{5756}{5834}So that's it? I only get|to bring one guest?
{5839}{5939}Yeah. What time do you|want to pick me up?
{5949}{5989}Hello?
{6009}{6091}You hear that?|I only get one extra ticket.
{6096}{6199}So somehow I have to pick|between you three and Ross.
{6239}{6325}- What about me?|- You said you didn't want to go.
{6331}{6400}I would still like|to be acknowledged.
{6406}{6524}- Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?|- Definitely not invisible.
{6576}{6665}Ross didn't care enough|to be here, so he's out.
{6671}{6762}- You snooze, you lose.|- He's not snoozing. He's teaching.
{6767}{6822}Well, then somebody's snoozing.
{6826}{6954}And, Joey, not that this should affect|you at all, but if you pick me...
{6959}{7096}...I was planning on wearing|a sequin dress cut down to here.
{7121}{7219}- I haven't seen this dress.|- Star in a movie.
{7230}{7347}Pick whoever you want. Listen|to your heart. What does it tell you?
{7351}{7424}Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.
{7460}{7502}Well...
{7565}{7624}I think I want to take Chandler.
{7629}{7714}Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.
{7758}{7854}- You want to take me?|- Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.
{7859}{7931}But Chandler's always|supported my career.
{7935}{8019}He's paid for acting classes,|headshots and stuff.
{8024}{8090}This will be my way|of paying you back.
{8094}{8194}So you're never actually|going to pay me back?
{8229}{8332}Just because he paid for your|headshots, you're gonna take him?
{8336}{8459}I don't think you're comprehending|just how slutty this dress is.
{8479}{8590}It's not just the stuff he paid for.|It's everything, you know?
{8596}{8693}He read lines with me.|He went with me on auditions.
{8700}{8777}Then he consoled me|after I didn't get parts.
{8782}{8868}You always believed in me, man,|even when I didn't.
{8873}{8973}I always knew you were gonna make it.|I'm so proud of you.
{8977}{9069}Thanks, that means a lot to me.
{9131}{9229}Mon, maybe one of these guys|wants to wear your dress.
{9239}{9363}- I'm gonna go shave.|- Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.
{9481}{9519}I have to pee.
{9523}{9651}If I don't come out, it's because I've|choked to death on the potpourri stink.
{9689}{9839}You hold her nose, I'll blow in her|mouth and the kid'll just... out of her.
{9878}{9955}She's a week late.|She's got to have it today.
{9959}{10065}I don't know. I think|it's still gonna be a while.
{10071}{10130}Care to make it interesting?
{10135}{10217}- I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.|- You're on.
{10222}{10308}- Okay, how much?|- One hundred thousand dollars.
{10340}{10461}- How about 50 bucks?|- I'll call Zurich and move some money.
{10465}{10550}All right, whose turn is it|to help me get up?
{10581}{10624}No one's here.
{10685}{10740}Oh, damn it!
{11053}{11177}This is exciting. So glamorous! People|taking our picture. How do I look?
{11188}{11253}- A little tall.|- What?
{11258}{11359}Would you crouch down a bit|so that I look taller?
{11388}{11444}There you go.
{11483}{11549}It's just so glamorous.
{11629}{11699}Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.
{11704}{11774}And you're still pregnant.
{11779}{11852}I'm sorry. I know|how uncomfortable you are.
{11857}{11977}You know what? You look great.|Yeah, like 50 bucks.
{12016}{12157}I have to go pee. Apparently this baby|thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.
{12201}{12287}Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.
{12296}{12417}That's interesting that you lost.|Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
{12421}{12474}All right, stop it.
{12480}{12556}- Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.|- Fine.
{12561}{12699}Until then, General Grant, why don't|you set up camp... right there?
{12726}{12814}- Rachel here? We have an appointment.|- In the bathroom.
{12819}{12897}- Rach, we gotta go.|- In a minute!
{12948}{13077}People ask why we're not together.|I just don't know what to tell them.
{13082}{13176}- All right, let's go.|- Do you want to go change first?
{13182}{13276}The doctor's staying open late for us,|but if you hurry...
{13308}{13394}- No, I'm fine.|- You don't think that's inappropriate?
{13408}{13518}- What?|- Good God, man. Don't anger it.
{13574}{13715}Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.|For the first time in weeks, I am...
{13719}{13807}Fine. Whatever you want.|You're the mommy.
{13811}{13859}No! Don't call me "Mommy."
{13865}{13956}It's bad enough you call|your own mother that.
{13972}{14046}I'm actually with her on this one.
{14205}{14269}{y:i}I thought I knew who the enemy was...
{14274}{14382}Okay, this is it. This is|my big fight scene coming up.
{14393}{14484}{y:i}I'm fighting for every man|{y:i}in the 82nd Ground Division.
{14687}{14773}Ross?|Can I ask you something?
{14778}{14874}When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
{14886}{14951}...were you this irritating?
{15036}{15089}- Excuse me?|- Nothing. You're just...
{15093}{15219}You've been a little short with me|lately. I'm not trying to irritate you.
{15223}{15319}Well, then, you must have|a natural talent for it.
{15325}{15468}The doctor will be in soon.|Why don't we not speak until then?
{15575}{15655}Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross.|That's great.
{15734}{15809}We should ask the doctor|if she even knows...
{15813}{15944}...how to deliver a baby|that's half human, half pure evil!
{16003}{16077}- Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?|- You're nice to her.
{16082}{16153}She has the drugs.
{16176}{16232}We'll do a quick check.
{16237}{16328}Eight days late, huh?|You must be getting uncomfortable.
{16332}{16394}Yeah, just a tad.
{16416}{16536}You're 80%"%" effaced. You're on your way.|It still could last a while.
{16541}{16664}- There are ways to help things along.|- Do them!
{16686}{16778}Actually, they're things|you can do. Home remedies.
{16783}{16874}In my experience, I've found|some are very effective.
{16879}{17014}- Well, we are ready to try anything.|- There's an herbal tea you can drink.
{17019}{17107}You can take some castor oil.|There's spicy foods.
{17112}{17155}We will do all of those.
{17161}{17217}- Taking a long walk.|- Good. Done.
{17222}{17344}And there's the one that's|proved most effective: Sex.
{17454}{17538}You've got to be kidding me!
{17872}{17947}Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!
{17963}{18041}- You liked it? You really liked it?|- Oh, yeah!
{18046}{18154}- Well, which part exactly?|- The whole thing! Here we go!
{18159}{18216}No, no, no. Give me some specifics.
{18221}{18318}I loved the specifics.|The specifics were the best part.
{18323}{18463}Hey, what about the scene with|the kangaroo? Did you like that part?
{18469}{18604}I was surprised to see a kangaroo|in a World War I epic.
{18629}{18683}You fell asleep!
{18688}{18812}There was no kangaroo! They didn't|take any of my suggestions!
{18865}{18984}- Thanks for coming. See you later.|- Don't go. I'm so sorry.
{18988}{19089}Look, this guy fell asleep!|He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
{19118}{19198}Or call an ambulance!
{19280}{19374}What did the doctor say?|Any news on when the baby will come?
{19378}{19461}No. She gave us ideas|on how to induce labor.
{19465}{19499}We tried them all.
{19503}{19642}We went for a walk, we tried tea,|castor oil, spicy food. Nothing worked.
{19648}{19704}There is one thing we didn't try.
{19708}{19807}But someone thinks that|that will open up a can of worms.
{19812}{19905}If it's gonna help|bring the baby here, today...
{19909}{19971}...I think you should do it.
{20004}{20088}- It's sex.|- Do it!
{20096}{20184}- Monica.|- It's been a really long time for you.
{20189}{20318}I mean, women have needs.|Do it. Get yours.
{20336}{20393}Oh, I don't know about that.
{20425}{20577}I think if the two of you had sex, the|repercussions would be catastrophic.
{20600}{20654}All right, let's be practical.
{20659}{20805}If Ross isn't willing, he's not|the only guy you can have sex with.
{20810}{20890}You could borrow Chandler.|Chandler is good.
{20918}{20988}Monica, what is the matter with you?
{20994}{21078}- I just want the baby to be born today.|- Why today?
{21103}{21148}Okay, fine.
{21159}{21274}I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have|the baby, and I don't want to lose.
{21285}{21414}What? While she's been going through|this hell, you've been making money?
{21419}{21528}You're betting on your friend|staying in this misery?
{21582}{21667}- I'll take that bet.|- What?
{21671}{21769}I'm miserable. I may as well|make some money out of it.
{21773}{21829}Can I get some of that action?
{21835}{21891}I'm betting against all of you?
{21896}{21967}I really feel like|tomorrow it's gonna happen.
{21972}{22014}Okay.
{22165}{22242}Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
{22246}{22347}Where have you been?|I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.
{22352}{22438}Oh, no. Were you upset?|Did you lose sleep?
{22457}{22490}I'm so sorry.
{22495}{22587}The reason I came over is|to settle things between us.
{22591}{22691}I wanted to pay you back|with the premiere, but you missed it.
{22697}{22751}- So how much do I owe you?|- What?
{22757}{22843}- I don't want to owe you anything.|- You don't owe me.
{22849}{22910}- I don't want your...|- We're doing this!
{22915}{22983}You got me my first headshots.|How much?
{22992}{23095}- I don't know, $500.|- Okay, $500. What else?
{23100}{23215}Then there was the second set.|The infamous "booger" headshots.
{23241}{23343}Okay, so that's another $500.|That's 500 and 500. That's...
{23447}{23520}- You want a calculator?|- Please.
{23550}{23591}Here.
{23699}{23733}All right, what else?
{23738}{23856}Well, there's acting classes,|stage-combat classes, tap classes...
{23861}{23931}Which we're still keeping|under our hats.
{23936}{24043}That dialect coach who helped you|with a Southern accent.
{24047}{24155}Which, after 20 hours of lessons,|still came out Jamaican.
{24176}{24310}What the hell are you talking about?|The South will rise again, man.
{24374}{24439}Yes, money well-spent.
{24444}{24496}Okay, what else? Rent.
{24501}{24613}Two, three years of rent,|utilities, food...
{24619}{24727}Okay, so I'm writing you|a check for...
{24751}{24896}So you fell asleep during my movie.|Big deal, right?
{24902}{24975}How do you clear this thing?
{25077}{25126}Finish your enchilada.
{25130}{25226}Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.|It's not working.
{25230}{25310}Okay, here, have one of these peppers.
{25378}{25488}Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.
{25502}{25630}By the way, you don't want to touch|the pepper and then touch your eye.
{25671}{25757}I am feeling nothing.
{25829}{25904}Speaking of hot,|watching you do that...
{25908}{25997}...really makes me want|to have sex with you.
{26007}{26092}- Stop it.|- Come on! Why are we wasting time?
{26096}{26205}We know it's gonna work.|It's doctor-recommended.
{26209}{26350}I'm sorry. But we have to have|some boundaries. My God, I'm dying.
{26354}{26426}We've done it before.|We'll do it again.
{26430}{26506}It'll be a nice way|to bookend the pregnancy.
{26512}{26596}I'm not gonna make love to you|so you'll go into labor.
{26601}{26685}Make love? What are you, a girl?
{26727}{26806}Always a great way to get|into a man's pants.
{26811}{26921}You'll be performing a service.|Think of me as a ketchup bottle.
{26925}{27038}Sometimes, you have to bang on|the end of it to get it to come out.
{27086}{27170}I love when you talk dirty to me.
{27197}{27267}I know it. You're right.|That's not sexy.
{27350}{27434}Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.
{27439}{27498}Let me just bend over and get it.
{27677}{27714}Oh, God!
{27786}{27870}Okay, enough.|This is not going to happen.
{27876}{27938}Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.
{27943}{28035}Come on, you started this,|now you finish it!
{28049}{28119}Come on, wuss. Make love to me.
{28159}{28235}- You know what?|- What?
{28242}{28290}Forget it.
{28312}{28391}What now, Ross,|you're not gonna talk?
{28395}{28485}How on earth will you ever annoy me?
{28491}{28565}Oh, wait a minute, I know.
{28642}{28743}You'd think the jalapeno would|clear up your sinuses, but no!
{28749}{28811}That's not enough...|What are you doing?
{28815}{28896}I'm getting that baby out of you!
{29047}{29091}- Oh, God!|- I know.
{29097}{29148}Oh, no, no, no.
{29166}{29235}I think my water just broke.
{29249}{29315}I am good!
{29347}{29446}Okay, I got the pillow.|I got the bag.
{29450}{29527}- You got the keys?|- I got the keys.
{29640}{29682}We're having a baby.
{30003}{30122}I didn't have time to read this part|of the books, but do we have time...?
{30127}{30196}- Not so much.|- Okay, let's go.
{30307}{30337}- 200.|- Thank you.
{30341}{30470}That's it. I don't care when|the baby comes. No more betting.
{30514}{30555}Hello?
{30734}{30816}I guess we could bet|one more time.
{30820}{30928}- Is Rachel having the baby?|- How did you know that?
{30934}{31011}- Joey! Chandler!|- They're at the coffee house.
{31016}{31075}You know everything!
{31081}{31162}Wait. I bet you the baby|is over 7 pounds.
{31191}{31281}I bet you it has hair!|I bet you it's a girl.
{31285}{31375}- We know it's a girl.|- I'll give you really good odds.

{111}{199}Yes! From home to the hospital|in seven minutes!
{203}{283}Yes. The hard part is truly over.
{295}{366}We're off to a great start, aren't we?
{370}{459}I knew I'd get here fast,|but this has to be a record!
{466}{540}- Oh, you made it!|- Hi.
{551}{664}- How the hell did you beat us here?|- We took a cab. Did you walk?
{668}{758}No, we took a cab too.|But I did test runs...
{770}{801}Hey, you made it!
{826}{923}Okay, is there some kind of magic|tunnel to this hospital?
{933}{1027}Ross, you stay here and talk.|I'm gonna go have a baby.

{1370}{1472}Yes, I see that here.|We can't guarantee a private room.
{1476}{1611}- Currently, they're all unavailable.|- Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
{1616}{1703}I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms|are all we have.
{1707}{1796}Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
{1860}{1963}- Give her some money.|- I really think they're out of rooms.
{1967}{2083}They're saving them for important|people! What if I was the president?
{2088}{2207}We'd be in a lot of trouble.|You don't know where any countries are.
{2221}{2258}Okay.
{2273}{2360}Say, would you mind checking again?
{2365}{2469}See if any private rooms|may have opened up?
{2494}{2542}This is a hospital.
{2547}{2629}You know what?|I don't really care for your tone.
{2633}{2775}This is not the only hospital in the|city. We have no problem... Oh, gosh!
{2779}{2823}- What, what?|- Contraction!
{2827}{2862}Oh!
{2915}{3042}- Like to see a semi-private room?|- Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

{4986}{5104}Hi, I'm Ross. I'm here to ruin|this magical day for you.
{5109}{5189}Not at all. Marc Horger.|This is my wife, Julie.
{5193}{5269}- Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.|- Oh, hi, Rachel.
{5273}{5326}- Is this your first?|- It is.
{5330}{5396}Well, little Jamie here is our third.

{5488}{5559}- That's so sweet.|- Yeah.
{5598}{5723}- Let me give you guys some privacy.|- Nonsense. We're all in this together.

{6387}{6500}- Hey, look at this. Here you go!|- Oh, no!
{6636}{6701}Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
{6706}{6815}The miracle of birth|sure is a snooze-fest.
{6861}{6955}- Hey, you wanna see something?|- Sure. What?
{6960}{7036}This will be fun.|Watch me freak out Chandler.
{7040}{7091}- Honey?|- Yeah?
{7095}{7170}Listen, I've been doing|some thinking...
{7175}{7272}...and I don't know whether|it's because we're here...
{7276}{7342}...or Rachel's giving birth...
{7346}{7441}...but I think we should|try to have a baby.
{7528}{7574}Okay.
{7620}{7661}What's that now?
{7669}{7767}Okay. I've been thinking about it too.|I think we're ready.
{7823}{7911}Are you kidding? You think|we're ready to have a baby?
{7916}{7950}Oh, this is fun.
{8000}{8094}You're ready to have a baby?|My boy's all grown up!
{8098}{8138}You said you were ready.
{8142}{8244}I was screwing with you to get|your voice high and weird...
{8248}{8281}...like mine is now!
{8292}{8362}Yes, but haven't you|wanted a kid forever?
{8367}{8430}Okay, just back off, mister!
{8481}{8552}Because I am ready to have a baby.
{8556}{8618}I just want Joey to be the father.
{8637}{8751}- What? Are you crazy?|- Right there! That's all I wanted!
{8782}{8891}I'm sorry. The doctor insisted|on closing the curtain for the exam.
{8895}{8974}Oh, that's very...|Really, very, very okay.
{8979}{9115}Julie's cervix is dilated seven|centimeters. That's about four fingers!
{9133}{9213}- Doctor let me feel it.|- Have you felt Rachel's?
{9218}{9296}- No, I don't...|- We won't be doing that.
{9300}{9407}Well, you could feel Rachel's,|then feel mine to compare.
{9412}{9526}- Am I interrupting?|- Yes! Thank you! Later.
{9531}{9594}- You can't leave me with them.|- Sorry.
{9598}{9718}No, Ross, Ross? Ross?|My child has no father!
{9722}{9857}I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna|be a while. I wish you'd called first.
{9862}{9924}I'm coming back later with your father.
{9928}{10028}- I need to talk to you before the birth.|- Okay. What's up?
{10032}{10103}I brought something|that I want to give you.
{10107}{10186}Assuming, of course, that you want it.
{10202}{10278}Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
{10305}{10410}Your grandma's engagement ring,|I want you to give it to Rachel.
{10415}{10499}- Mom, no. Come on. Thank you...|- Just hear me out...
{10503}{10613}No! Okay? We're not getting|married because she's pregnant.
{10617}{10777}Honestly, this isn't just some girl|you picked up in a bar and humped.
{10838}{10885}A child should have a family.
{10890}{10954}I can't deal with this now. I'm sorry.
{10958}{11054}Think about it. If you don't,|I'll talk more about humping.
{11059}{11103}Give me that.
{11116}{11199}- Hi, dear.|- Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
{11204}{11273}Ross, get in here!
{11363}{11487}She dragged me out of the labor room|to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
{11518}{11616}- Why aren't you with Rachel?|- Are you kidding?
{11620}{11715}We're not gonna be together|because we're having a baby!
{11720}{11774}It seems you belong together.
{11778}{11874}I can't deal with this right now.|I have to go have a baby.
{11879}{11941}Right. And with who again?
{11967}{12050}He's crazy. Why doesn't|he wanna be with Rachel?
{12055}{12080}I know.
{12084}{12190}She's like the perfect woman.|I know she turned me down...
{12194}{12322}...but if she wanted to be with me,|I would take her in my arms and...
{12407}{12495}I haven't bummed you guys out|like this in a while.
{12587}{12619}- Hey.|- Hey.
{12623}{12686}- Who's that?|- New people.
{12730}{12797}What happened to the Disgustingtons?
{12801}{12930}They're having their baby.|It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
{12934}{12998}After you left, they wheeled her off.
{13002}{13150}Not before she gave me a nice, juicy|shot of little Jamie, crowning away.
{13155}{13193}Wow. Sorry.
{13197}{13261}So how are the new people?
{13266}{13355}Well, they have some unusual|pet names for each other.
{13359}{13511}Including "Evil Bitch"|and "Sick Bastard."
{13520}{13632}- Oh, gosh, a contraction.|- Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
{13637}{13685}- Are you looking at her?|- No!
{13690}{13815}- Don't look at her, you sick bastard!|- I swear I wasn't looking at her!
{13820}{13946}She's in labor. You like that,|you sick son of a bitch?
{14013}{14042}I'm just gonna...
{14046}{14138}See? It's because you were looking,|you fat pervert.
{14142}{14276}No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.|Just want some privacy.
{14334}{14392}You miss your girlfriend?
{14410}{14478}Just ignore them.
{14483}{14542}- You okay?|- Yeah.
{14653}{14681}- Ross!|- What?
{14685}{14772}- He's looking at me.|- Hey!
{14777}{14823}Wanna live to see your baby?
{14828}{14931}Don't you talk to my husband like that,|you stupid bastard!
{15025}{15131}Oh, good God! If you want|a baby so bad, just go steal it!
{15184}{15263}Since when are you|so crazy about babies?
{15268}{15372}I'm not crazy about babies.|I'm crazy about us.
{15414}{15439}What?
{15459}{15535}We talk about having|babies someday, not now...
{15539}{15664}...but I'm starting to think that we|can handle it. We're good.
{15668}{15733}We're really good.
{15753}{15792}We are pretty good.
{15797}{15872}But nothing has to happen|until you're ready.
{15915}{15962}Well, maybe I'm ready now.
{15967}{16063}I mean, it's a little scary,|but maybe it's right.
{16068}{16140}It's not right!|We're not ready for a kid!
{16149}{16246}- What?|- I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
{16289}{16381}So we're gonna try?|I mean, we're trying?
{16386}{16451}We're trying to get pregnant.
{16550}{16638}I'm not comfortable doing|this in front of the babies.
{16643}{16772}- So when do you want to start trying?|- All right, hold on a sec.
{16780}{16845}- Period math?|- Yeah.
{16885}{16963}Well, we could start trying now.
{16973}{17079}- Right here?|- No, not here.
{17083}{17140}Maybe here.
{17144}{17245}We got time to kill. We're in|a building that's full of beds!
{17250}{17303}And it's so clean!
{17451}{17524}Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
{17528}{17621}- It ate your money?|- No.
{17698}{17791}- I'll see you downstairs then.|- All right.
{17805}{17874}Hey, I got one! I got one!
{17943}{17968}- Hi.|- Hi.
{17972}{18059}- Oh, up or down?|- Oh. Down, please.
{18131}{18215}I hate to be a ball-buster,|but can I just do it?
{18279}{18341}- Could you press up too?|- Sure.
{18378}{18481}- I feel bad. I broke my leg once too.|- How did yours happen?
{18486}{18544}It's a long, embarrassing story.
{18548}{18673}Let's just say, there was a|typographical error with a sex manual.
{18678}{18738}- How about you?|- Car accident.
{18743}{18858}- Idiot on a cell not paying attention?|- Yeah. Me.
{18907}{18980}Oh, hey, that's me.
{18997}{19073}Hey, I take it you're|just visiting someone.
{19077}{19183}Well, if you have some time,|and you wanna visit someone else...
{19189}{19230}Yeah. I would like that.
{19234}{19373}- Great. I'm in room...|- Wait! What? No! Elevator! No!
{19378}{19466}You gotta press the button.
{19537}{19604}They're bringing in another woman.
{19608}{19661}Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
{19666}{19776}She doesn't need to be.|She'll still have the baby before I do.
{19780}{19891}- Oh, Ross! Another contraction.|- Oh, okay. Here, here.
{19922}{19961}That's it.
{19965}{20073}- Oh, that sounded like a bad one.|- Yeah, it was.
{20078}{20192}Mine haven't been so bad.|Oh, here comes one now.
{20307}{20366}Oh, that was a big one.
{20503}{20609}Could you help me? The patient|I'm looking for has a broken leg.
{20613}{20718}He's in a wheelchair. He's early|to mid-30s, very attractive.
{20723}{20833}- I know who you're talking about.|- Great! What room is he in?
{20838}{20905}Sorry. That information is restricted.
{20909}{21045}- She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.|- Dr. Drake who?
{21050}{21185}Ramoray. It's Portuguese.|We need that information. I'm a doctor.
{21191}{21288}- At this hospital?|- Damn it! We're losing precious time.
{21292}{21393}You want this man's blood|on your head... Hands!
{21397}{21515}It is essential that you tell me|what room he is staying in.
{21519}{21572}He's a patient of mine.
{21577}{21638}- He's in room 816.|- 816. Thank you.
{21642}{21709}- And what is his name?|- No.
{21950}{22032}- I think we found a place.|- Okay.
{22098}{22177}- Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?|- Okay.
{22181}{22242}- We'll dim the lights.|- Okay.
{22246}{22318}Or turn them out altogether.
{22340}{22443}No scented candles.|Okay, here. There we go.
{22447}{22537}Okay, okay.|Making me sterile, but okay.
{22639}{22753}Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait.|Do we have a condom?
{22766}{22811}Oh, right!
{22999}{23098}Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
{23158}{23189}This is it!
{23216}{23279}- That's him!|- Great. Go get him!
{23297}{23391}Wait a second.|Or maybe you could go in first.
{23395}{23456}He's not really my type.
{23460}{23563}Not you. Dr. Ramoray. Ask him|questions and see what he's like.
{23567}{23654}- People tell doctors everything.|- You said he's great.
{23659}{23765}Guys I meet seem nice at first,|then turn out to be big jerks.
{23770}{23848}- You do attract some stinkers.|- I know.
{23871}{23956}Dr. Long, I've been at this|for 17 hours.
{23960}{24022}Three women have had their babies.
{24027}{24140}Give me good news. How many|centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
{24144}{24196}- Three.|- Just 3?
{24201}{24258}I'm dilated 3!
{24307}{24413}We are moving along slowly.|Don't worry, you're doing great.
{24417}{24499}- I'll be back soon.|- Thank you.
{24540}{24618}I'm not waiting.|I'm gonna push this baby out.
{24622}{24740}I'm doing it. Three centimeters.|That's gotta be like this, right?
{24753}{24890}- Actually, it's more like this.|- Oh, stupid metric system.
{24916}{24970}Oh! Oh! Oh!
{24978}{25051}We'll take you straight|to the delivery room.
{25055}{25145}Oh, for the love of God!
{25172}{25310}I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few|routine questions I need to ask you.
{25314}{25369}I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
{25374}{25448}I know. I'm a neurologist.|To be safe...
{25452}{25574}...Dr. Wells wanted a more|comprehensive overview. So he sent me.
{25583}{25642}Dr. Wells is a woman!
{25672}{25743}That was a test. Good response.
{25781}{25859}- All right. Full name?|- Clifford Burnett.
{25864}{25943}- Date of birth?|- November 16, 1968.
{25948}{25978}Age?
{26015}{26146}- Can't you figure that out?|- I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.
{26170}{26239}- I'm 33.|- Okay.
{26262}{26319}- And are you married?|- No.
{26324}{26484}Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would|you say you have commitment issues?
{26515}{26588}Are all the questions this personal?
{26592}{26629}Yes.
{26658}{26735}Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.
{26740}{26837}- Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.|- Yeah.
{26848}{26943}Do you sleep with women|and never call them again?
{26976}{27021}- No.|- Excellent. Excellent.
{27025}{27161}And finally, are you into any weird|stuff, you know, sexually?
{27182}{27271}- No!|- Wrong answer.
{27322}{27393}- What else? What else?|- He's 33.
{27397}{27438}- A widower.|- Oh!
{27443}{27575}He seemed like a standup guy. And|he's not into anything weird sexually.
{27603}{27663}Enter Pheebs!
{27724}{27808}- This room's available.|- Okay! Wait, listen to me!
{27812}{27871}Since I've been waiting,|four women...
{27876}{27963}...one higher than the centimeters|I'm dilated...
{27967}{28095}...have come and gone with their babies.|I'm next. My turn. It's only fair.
{28099}{28226}If you bring in one more woman who has|her baby before me, I will sue you.
{28231}{28334}Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you.|My husband is a lawyer.
{28338}{28430}- Rach?|- You get back on that case, honey!
{28435}{28508}I don't think the next|patient is far along.
{28513}{28599}Okay. Well, then bring her in.
{28795}{28925}Oh, my God!
{29252}{29348}I can't believe this!
{29385}{29494}And yet, somehow, it's true.
{29512}{29618}I mean, this is so great.|We're gonna be baby buddies!
{29673}{29755}Squeeze your legs together,|cover the baby's ears.
{29764}{29842}- Hi, sweetie!|- Hi, sweetheart.
{29846}{29938}This is my husband, Sid.|I don't think you've met him.
{29944}{30079}I nabbed him at the dermatologist's.|Thank God for adult acne!
{30083}{30178}I can't believe it.|I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
{30182}{30226}Really?
{30250}{30276}What did he say?
{30281}{30373}You have to speak loudly,|he's almost completely deaf.
{30378}{30460}- Oh, there you go.|- Of course he is.
{30464}{30560}Congratulations!|I didn't even know you got married.
{30566}{30642}- Oh, no. We didn't.|- What?
{30647}{30778}We're just having this baby together,|but that's all. You know?
{30782}{30825}Why?
{30872}{31029}We're just not in that place, you know?|But we're very excited about this.
{31034}{31102}Oh. Well, then shut me up.
{31128}{31183}Just tell me how.
{31199}{31273}Oh, I feel another one coming.

{35680}{35704}Janice.
{35710}{35846}Not just Janice. Janice in labor.|Contracting and everything.
{35854}{35936}Oh, this should be easy.|I have a very wide pelvis.
{35941}{36000}You remember, Chandler.
{36057}{36110}I didn't know you were pregnant.
{36114}{36229}Who's the unwitting human|whose essence you've stolen?
{36266}{36313}It's you.
{36321}{36372}This is yours.
{36377}{36416}What?
{36421}{36542}Look how nervous he gets!|We haven't slept together in years!
{36587}{36688}That's funny. Does it hurt?|Does the labor hurt?
{36731}{36821}Okay, I have one.|If you had to, which would you eat?
{36826}{36931}A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
{36991}{37069}I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
{37073}{37188}'Cause at least I could explain to him|that you're making me eat him.
{37201}{37287}- Oh. Somebody went to college.|- Yeah.
{37291}{37344}Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
{37349}{37421}I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.
{37425}{37491}Oh. I'll get it.
{37518}{37637}I usually get to know a girl better|before I let her spoon me.
{37642}{37720}Relax. It's not like we're forking.
{37873}{38009}Oh, that's five, Ross.|Five women have had five babies...
{38013}{38072}...and I have had no babies.
{38076}{38144}Why doesn't she want to come out?
{38148}{38220}I think you made such a nice|home for her...
{38224}{38327}...the last nine months,|that she just doesn't want to leave.
{38332}{38474}Oh, look at you making up crap for me.
{38500}{38578}- Oh, God.|- Okay. Okay.
{38583}{38644}Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.
{38650}{38705}Do something! Get me drugs...
{38709}{38806}...or you light a fire up in there|and just smoke it out!
{38842}{38924}I think you're ready to go|to the delivery room.
{38929}{38953}What?
{38958}{39063}Ten centimeters.|You're about to become a mom.
{39067}{39151}Oh, my God. Okay.
{39156}{39261}Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.
{39405}{39526}Oh, my God! That's the doctor|who was in my room before.
{39548}{39655}Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.
{39678}{39770}I'm telling you, the guy|from that show was here...
{39775}{39847}...asking me all these weird questions.
{39852}{39951}Do you really believe that a character|from a TV show was here?
{39956}{40015}Rachel's having her baby!
{40066}{40123}That's him! You know him?
{40138}{40226}Okay. Okay. L... Okay.
{40230}{40327}I sent my friend, Joey,|in here to find out stuff about you.
{40331}{40425}If it, you know, if it helps,|you came off great.
{40430}{40518}A lot better than I'm coming off|right now.
{40523}{40622}I don't believe this. You had him|pretend he was a fake doctor?
{40627}{40713}Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
{40736}{40880}- You tried making me think I was crazy?|- That was wrong. I'm so sorry.
{40884}{40987}It's just that I liked you so much.|Can we just start over?
{40991}{41019}I don't think so.
{41027}{41144}If I may? You told me a lot|of personal stuff about you, right?
{41148}{41269}Now, maybe it would help if you knew|some personal stuff about her.
{41273}{41355}She was married to a gay ice dancer.
{41360}{41465}She gave birth to her|brother's triplets.
{41511}{41638}Her twin sister used to do porn.
{41642}{41741}- We're trying to dial down the crazy.|- Right.
{41799}{41902}We don't know each other,|so it'd be easy to forget this...
{41909}{42006}...but there's something between us.|I don't know about you...
{42011}{42074}...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
{42105}{42216}- It doesn't happen to me, either.|- Me, neither!
{42265}{42376}Push. Push. We're gonna push|for five more seconds.
{42381}{42422}Five, four...
{42427}{42482}Three, two, one! Oh!
{42503}{42579}The next contraction will be|in 20 seconds.
{42583}{42653}- I can't push anymore!|- You're doing great.
{42658}{42734}Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!
{42742}{42795}Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
{42800}{42843}- Come on.|- Push. Wait.
{42849}{42935}- I see something.|- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!
{42941}{43015}- Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!|- What is that?
{43020}{43080}The baby's buttocks. She's breech.
{43085}{43186}- I thought she had two heads.|- Oh, God!
{43190}{43219}Will she be okay?
{43224}{43259}- She'll be fine.|- Yeah.
{43264}{43340}She's in a difficult position,|so push hard.
{43345}{43400}- Okay.|- Go. Come on. Go! Go!
{43406}{43451}You'll have to push harder.
{43456}{43565}- I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!|- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
{43569}{43674}I can't do it.|Please, you do it for me!
{43679}{43835}Let's go. One more time.|One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
{43849}{43894}Good.
{43899}{43962}Keep pushing!
{43973}{44051}Are you okay?
{44073}{44165}You have no idea how much this hurts.
{44211}{44293}Keep going! Keep going!
{44297}{44330}Here we go!
{44334}{44406}She's upside down, but she's coming!
{44417}{44474}- Oh, God!|- Oh! Oh, my God!
{44479}{44549}Oh, my God, she's here.
{44618}{44671}Oh, she's perfect.
{44677}{44796}Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.
{44896}{44995}- Where'd she go?|- They're just wrapping her up.
{45001}{45102}Okay. Well, be careful with her,|she's really tiny.
{45143}{45219}Here she is.
{45450}{45540}Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
{45584}{45662}I know. Oh.
{45763}{45897}She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
{45914}{45986}- Do we have a name yet?|- No, not yet.
{45991}{46077}Fine. For now we'll just|call her Baby Girl Greene.
{46082}{46168}Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.
{46563}{46647}Hello, Baby Girl.
{46783}{46838}- Can we come in?|- Oh, come on in.
{46842}{46932}- Oh, there she is.|- Oh, she's so beautiful.
{46936}{46973}Here.
{46987}{47100}Oh, my God. She's amazing.
{47104}{47223}Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk|and had sex.
{47248}{47338}It's incredible. I mean,|one minute she's inside you...
{47342}{47418}...and then 47 hours later,|here she is.
{47543}{47619}She looks so real.
{47640}{47675}You know what I mean.
{47680}{47762}- Okay, my turn. My turn.|- Aunt Phoebe.
{47767}{47864}Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!
{47868}{47965}Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
{47996}{48053}I won't.
{48057}{48176}- Honey, what's the matter?|- Nothing. I just can't stop crying.
{48181}{48273}The doctor said it's normal,|plus you're sleep-deprived.
{48278}{48329}You guys are all sleep-deprived.
{48335}{48456}I don't see you weeping because you|put your slippers on the wrong feet.
{48465}{48506}Oh, God.
{48511}{48620}- What's the matter now?|- I was reliving it.
{48644}{48716}Do you know what you're gonna|call her yet?
{48721}{48848}Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?|I thought that was so original.
{48869}{48935}Actually, we've narrowed it|down to two.
{48941}{49083}And you know what? I love them both.|So just pick one, and that'll be it.
{49087}{49225}Wow, okay. Everyone?
{49229}{49326}This is Isabella.
{49331}{49424}- Hi, Isabella!|- Hi.
{49491}{49515}What?
{49521}{49587}That's not her name.
{49592}{49676}I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel|like an Isabella.
{49681}{49738}- What was the other one?|- Delilah.
{49744}{49859}Oh, great! At least she|sounds like a biblical whore.
{49920}{50017}So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
{50058}{50086}What will we do?
{50091}{50157}- You'll find a name.|- Easy for you to say.
{50161}{50229}You know what your|kids' names will be.
{50233}{50338}- You do?|- I had them picked out since I was 14.
{50344}{50463}Oh, no, it's gonna be named after|some snack or baked good, isn't it?
{50535}{50663}- Well, tell us, what are they?|- Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
{50668}{50748}- And if it's a girl?|- I don't want to say.
{50754}{50851}Oh, stop. Tell us.|We're not gonna want it.
{50855}{50914}Okay. It's Emma.
{50920}{50992}Emma.
{51085}{51155}See, I don't want it.
{51259}{51333}- Take it.|- What?
{51346}{51387}She's clearly an Emma.
{51392}{51472}Oh, honey, but you love that name.
{51476}{51562}Yeah. But I love you more.
{51603}{51714}Besides, nothing goes with Bing.|So I'm screwed.
{51846}{51986}Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like|to say hello to his future bride.
{51991}{52042}Oh.
{52190}{52274}Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,|doesn't he?
{52278}{52344}He's a keeper.
{52358}{52467}- How are you feeling?|- Oh, I'm fine.
{52492}{52636}I really admire what you're doing.|Just raising her all alone.
{52640}{52702}I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
{52708}{52838}Sure. Now. But what happens when he|meets somebody else and gets married?
{52858}{52946}Well, then he gets a divorce.|It's Ross.
{53004}{53068}I'm telling you. Listen to Janice.
{53073}{53221}They all say they're gonna be there,|until they start their real family.
{53240}{53332}- That's never gonna happen with Ross.|- That's what I thought.
{53336}{53437}I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend|a weekend with her father...
{53442}{53499}...and little Miss New Boobs.
{53517}{53570}Really?
{53581}{53636}I hate to be the one to say it...
{53641}{53762}...but, honey, you two are on your own.
{53788}{53858}Well, that's, you know, that's...
{53863}{53966}We've been alone for the last|20 minutes and we're doing okay.
{53994}{54035}Maybe we won't be alone.
{54040}{54159}Because lately things have been|happening between me and Ross.
{54163}{54276}And right before I went into labor,|we had this kiss. You know?
{54281}{54423}So it might be the beginning|of something.
{54441}{54502}- Hey, Janice.|- Oh, hi.
{54514}{54613}Who's this little guy?
{54619}{54724}- Aaron, your future son-in-law.|- Oh, no, no.
{54739}{54838}- I'm gonna leave you three alone.|- Okay.
{54852}{54928}Man, you see the kid on that nose?
{55010}{55076}You know what I was thinking about?
{55137}{55275}That kiss before we left the apartment.|That was something, huh?
{55306}{55374}Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
{55378}{55444}But we, we gotta be careful.
{55448}{55553}We... You know, we can't let|that happen again, you know?
{55594}{55639}Right.
{55644}{55800}- We don't want to go down that road.|- No. That's why I brought it up.
{55886}{55976}- They didn't have any sodas?|- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
{55981}{56078}I was talking to this nurse.|Completely forgot.
{56115}{56189}And so it begins.
{56346}{56374}She in there?
{56383}{56463}Yeah. She's putting her down now.|That's her.
{56467}{56582}- Look at Emma.|- I can't decide who she looks like.
{56586}{56691}Oh, what, are you kidding?|She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.
{56791}{56912}I'm sorry. For the last time,|why aren't you two together again?
{56936}{57012}No, I know.|Because you're not in that place.
{57016}{57092}Which would be fine,|except you totally are.
{57097}{57185}It's complicated, okay?
{57202}{57309}You love her, you always have,|you have a child together.
{57314}{57371}There's no right answer.
{57410}{57527}Look, we've been together.|Then apart. Then together, then apart.
{57531}{57603}And now we have a baby.
{57658}{57773}It's just, if we got together again|and it didn't work out?
{57786}{57864}I could never do that to Emma.
{57895}{58043}I mean, she came into this world|thinking everything... Now me.
{58048}{58138}What, do they put something|in the water here?
{58151}{58237}It's just, Rachel and I,|we're doing really well now.
{58241}{58333}I know. If you try to make it more,|you might wreck it.
{58337}{58407}- Yeah, exactly.|- Right.
{58446}{58547}Or you might get everything|you've wanted since you were 15.
{58756}{58803}Hey.
{58807}{58893}I saw a woman breastfeeding|twins at the same time.
{58897}{58963}It is like a freak show up here.
{58978}{59025}- What's the matter?|- Nothing.
{59029}{59068}What is it? Hey?
{59073}{59176}- Really, it's nothing. I'm...|- Rach, come on. What?
{59194}{59317}I've just been thinking about how|my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
{59327}{59395}What are you talking about?|What about Ross?
{59400}{59548}Please. He'll be with his real family.|The twins and little Miss New Boobs.
{59553}{59629}Okay, how long|was I watching that woman?
{59644}{59706}I'm just saying that, you know...
{59712}{59786}...someday Ross is gonna|meet somebody...
{59791}{59859}...and he's gonna have his own life.
{59864}{59896}Right?
{59917}{59968}Yeah, I guess so.
{60027}{60144}I just never thought I'd be raising|this baby all by myself.
{60149}{60190}That's pretty dumb, huh?
{60196}{60270}Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
{60275}{60374}You are never, ever gonna be alone.
{60379}{60492}Okay? I promise I|won't let that happen.
{60520}{60658}Joey. Oh, sweetie,|what would I do without you?
{60662}{60748}You don't have to worry about that,|okay?
{60835}{60909}Could you grab me my other box|of tissues?
{60913}{60999}- They're under Ross' coat.|- Sure.
{61204}{61274}Oh, my God!
{61286}{61335}Joey?
{61385}{61446}Oh, my God.
{61571}{61622}Okay.
{62457}{62527}- That was amazing.|- I know.
{62570}{62714}Hey, do you realize that we may have|just changed our lives forever?
{62718}{62821}We may have started our family.|In nine months we could be here...
{62826}{62879}...having our own baby.
{62884}{62968}And if not, we got to do it|on a bucket.

{1173}{1257}Do you sleep with women|and never call them again?
{1262}{1391}Oh, my God!
{1620}{1727}Should we tell Rachel there's an empty|room right next to hers?
{1736}{1831}We could. Or we could have sex in it.
{1846}{1957}Well, let me think about that.|While I remove my pants!
{1980}{2087}Okay, mister! Fertilize me!
{2332}{2398}Does that sound like Janice?

{3558}{3582}- Hey.|- Hi.
{3587}{3663}I can't believe this is taking so long.|How are you?

{3863}{3939}Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?
{3944}{4003}Mother of God, it's true!
{4015}{4111}Chandler Bing!
{4115}{4139}Janice.
{4145}{4281}Not just Janice. Janice in labor.|Contracting and everything.
{4289}{4371}Oh, this should be easy.|I have a very wide pelvis.
{4376}{4435}You remember, Chandler.
{4492}{4545}I didn't know you were pregnant.
{4549}{4664}Who's the unwitting human|whose essence you've stolen?
{4701}{4748}It's you.
{4756}{4807}This is yours.
{4812}{4851}What?
{4856}{4977}Look how nervous he gets!|We haven't slept together in years!
{5022}{5123}That's funny. Does it hurt?|Does the labor hurt?
{5166}{5256}Okay, I have one.|If you had to, which would you eat?
{5261}{5366}A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
{5426}{5504}I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
{5508}{5623}'Cause at least I could explain to him|that you're making me eat him.
{5636}{5722}- Oh. Somebody went to college.|- Yeah.
{5726}{5779}Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
{5784}{5856}I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.
{5860}{5926}Oh. I'll get it.
{5953}{6072}I usually get to know a girl better|before I let her spoon me.
{6077}{6155}Relax. It's not like we're forking.
{6308}{6444}Oh, that's five, Ross.|Five women have had five babies...
{6448}{6507}...and I have had no babies.
{6511}{6579}Why doesn't she want to come out?
{6583}{6655}I think you made such a nice|home for her...
{6659}{6762}...the last nine months,|that she just doesn't want to leave.
{6767}{6909}Oh, look at you making up crap for me.
{6935}{7013}- Oh, God.|- Okay. Okay.
{7018}{7079}Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.
{7085}{7140}Do something! Get me drugs...
{7144}{7241}...or you light a fire up in there|and just smoke it out!
{7277}{7359}I think you're ready to go|to the delivery room.
{7364}{7388}What?
{7393}{7498}Ten centimeters.|You're about to become a mom.
{7502}{7586}Oh, my God. Okay.
{7591}{7696}Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.
{7840}{7961}Oh, my God! That's the doctor|who was in my room before.
{7983}{8090}Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.
{8113}{8205}I'm telling you, the guy|from that show was here...
{8210}{8282}...asking me all these weird questions.
{8287}{8386}Do you really believe that a character|from a TV show was here?
{8391}{8450}Rachel's having her baby!
{8501}{8558}That's him! You know him?
{8573}{8661}Okay. Okay. L... Okay.
{8665}{8762}I sent my friend, Joey,|in here to find out stuff about you.
{8766}{8860}If it, you know, if it helps,|you came off great.
{8865}{8953}A lot better than I'm coming off|right now.
{8958}{9057}I don't believe this. You had him|pretend he was a fake doctor?
{9062}{9148}Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
{9171}{9315}- You tried making me think I was crazy?|- That was wrong. I'm so sorry.
{9319}{9422}It's just that I liked you so much.|Can we just start over?
{9426}{9454}I don't think so.
{9462}{9579}If I may? You told me a lot|of personal stuff about you, right?
{9583}{9704}Now, maybe it would help if you knew|some personal stuff about her.
{9708}{9790}She was married to a gay ice dancer.
{9795}{9900}She gave birth to her|brother's triplets.
{9946}{10073}Her twin sister used to do porn.
{10077}{10176}- We're trying to dial down the crazy.|- Right.
{10234}{10337}We don't know each other,|so it'd be easy to forget this...
{10344}{10441}...but there's something between us.|I don't know about you...
{10446}{10509}...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
{10540}{10651}- It doesn't happen to me, either.|- Me, neither!
{10700}{10811}Push. Push. We're gonna push|for five more seconds.
{10816}{10857}Five, four...
{10862}{10917}Three, two, one! Oh!
{10938}{11014}The next contraction will be|in 20 seconds.
{11018}{11088}- I can't push anymore!|- You're doing great.
{11093}{11169}Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!
{11177}{11230}Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
{11235}{11278}- Come on.|- Push. Wait.
{11284}{11370}- I see something.|- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!
{11376}{11450}- Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?!|- What is that?
{11455}{11515}The baby's buttocks. She's breech.
{11520}{11621}- I thought she had two heads.|- Oh, God!
{11625}{11654}Will she be okay?
{11659}{11694}- She'll be fine.|- Yeah.
{11699}{11775}She's in a difficult position,|so push hard.
{11780}{11835}- Okay.|- Go. Come on. Go! Go!
{11841}{11886}You'll have to push harder.
{11891}{12000}- I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!|- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
{12004}{12109}I can't do it.|Please, you do it for me!
{12114}{12270}Let's go. One more time.|One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
{12284}{12329}Good.
{12334}{12397}Keep pushing!
{12408}{12486}Are you okay?
{12508}{12600}You have no idea how much this hurts.
{12646}{12728}Keep going! Keep going!
{12732}{12765}Here we go!
{12769}{12841}She's upside down, but she's coming!
{12852}{12909}- Oh, God!|- Oh! Oh, my God!
{12914}{12984}Oh, my God, she's here.
{13053}{13106}Oh, she's perfect.
{13112}{13231}Oh, wow! Oh, she's so tiny.
{13331}{13430}- Where'd she go?|- They're just wrapping her up.
{13436}{13537}Okay. Well, be careful with her,|she's really tiny.
{13578}{13654}Here she is.
{13885}{13975}Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
{14019}{14097}I know. Oh.
{14198}{14332}She's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
{14349}{14421}- Do we have a name yet?|- No, not yet.
{14426}{14512}Fine. For now we'll just|call her Baby Girl Greene.
{14517}{14603}Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Greene.
{14998}{15082}Hello, Baby Girl.
{15218}{15273}- Can we come in?|- Oh, come on in.
{15277}{15367}- Oh, there she is.|- Oh, she's so beautiful.
{15371}{15408}Here.
{15422}{15535}Oh, my God. She's amazing.
{15539}{15658}Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk|and had sex.
{15683}{15773}It's incredible. I mean,|one minute she's inside you...
{15777}{15853}...and then 47 hours later,|here she is.
{15978}{16054}She looks so real.
{16075}{16110}You know what I mean.
{16115}{16197}- Okay, my turn. My turn.|- Aunt Phoebe.
{16202}{16299}Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute!
{16303}{16400}Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
{16431}{16488}I won't.
{16492}{16611}- Honey, what's the matter?|- Nothing. I just can't stop crying.
{16616}{16708}The doctor said it's normal,|plus you're sleep-deprived.
{16713}{16764}You guys are all sleep-deprived.
{16770}{16891}I don't see you weeping because you|put your slippers on the wrong feet.
{16900}{16941}Oh, God.
{16946}{17055}- What's the matter now?|- I was reliving it.
{17079}{17151}Do you know what you're gonna|call her yet?
{17156}{17283}Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?|I thought that was so original.
{17304}{17370}Actually, we've narrowed it|down to two.
{17376}{17518}And you know what? I love them both.|So just pick one, and that'll be it.
{17522}{17660}Wow, okay. Everyone?
{17664}{17761}This is Isabella.
{17766}{17859}- Hi, Isabella!|- Hi.
{17926}{17950}What?
{17956}{18022}That's not her name.
{18027}{18111}I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel|like an Isabella.
{18116}{18173}- What was the other one?|- Delilah.
{18179}{18294}Oh, great! At least she|sounds like a biblical whore.
{18355}{18452}So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
{18493}{18521}What will we do?
{18526}{18592}- You'll find a name.|- Easy for you to say.
{18596}{18664}You know what your|kids' names will be.
{18668}{18773}- You do?|- I had them picked out since I was 14.
{18779}{18898}Oh, no, it's gonna be named after|some snack or baked good, isn't it?
{18970}{19098}- Well, tell us, what are they?|- Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
{19103}{19183}- And if it's a girl?|- I don't want to say.
{19189}{19286}Oh, stop. Tell us.|We're not gonna want it.
{19290}{19349}Okay. It's Emma.
{19355}{19427}Emma.
{19520}{19590}See, I don't want it.
{19694}{19768}- Take it.|- What?
{19781}{19822}She's clearly an Emma.
{19827}{19907}Oh, honey, but you love that name.
{19911}{19997}Yeah. But I love you more.
{20038}{20149}Besides, nothing goes with Bing.|So I'm screwed.
{20281}{20421}Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like|to say hello to his future bride.
{20426}{20477}Oh.
{20625}{20709}Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,|doesn't he?
{20713}{20779}He's a keeper.
{20793}{20902}- How are you feeling?|- Oh, I'm fine.
{20927}{21071}I really admire what you're doing.|Just raising her all alone.
{21075}{21137}I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
{21143}{21273}Sure. Now. But what happens when he|meets somebody else and gets married?
{21293}{21381}Well, then he gets a divorce.|It's Ross.
{21439}{21503}I'm telling you. Listen to Janice.
{21508}{21656}They all say they're gonna be there,|until they start their real family.
{21675}{21767}- That's never gonna happen with Ross.|- That's what I thought.
{21771}{21872}I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend|a weekend with her father...
{21877}{21934}...and little Miss New Boobs.
{21952}{22005}Really?
{22016}{22071}I hate to be the one to say it...
{22076}{22197}...but, honey, you two are on your own.
{22223}{22293}Well, that's, you know, that's...
{22298}{22401}We've been alone for the last|20 minutes and we're doing okay.
{22429}{22470}Maybe we won't be alone.
{22475}{22594}Because lately things have been|happening between me and Ross.
{22598}{22711}And right before I went into labor,|we had this kiss. You know?
{22716}{22858}So it might be the beginning|of something.
{22876}{22937}- Hey, Janice.|- Oh, hi.
{22949}{23048}Who's this little guy?
{23054}{23159}- Aaron, your future son-in-law.|- Oh, no, no.
{23174}{23273}- I'm gonna leave you three alone.|- Okay.
{23287}{23363}Man, you see the kid on that nose?
{23445}{23511}You know what I was thinking about?
{23572}{23710}That kiss before we left the apartment.|That was something, huh?
{23741}{23809}Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
{23813}{23879}But we, we gotta be careful.
{23883}{23988}We... You know, we can't let|that happen again, you know?
{24029}{24074}Right.
{24079}{24235}- We don't want to go down that road.|- No. That's why I brought it up.
{24321}{24411}- They didn't have any sodas?|- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
{24416}{24513}I was talking to this nurse.|Completely forgot.
{24550}{24624}And so it begins.
{24781}{24809}She in there?
{24818}{24898}Yeah. She's putting her down now.|That's her.
{24902}{25017}- Look at Emma.|- I can't decide who she looks like.
{25021}{25126}Oh, what, are you kidding?|She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.
{25226}{25347}I'm sorry. For the last time,|why aren't you two together again?
{25371}{25447}No, I know.|Because you're not in that place.
{25451}{25527}Which would be fine,|except you totally are.
{25532}{25620}It's complicated, okay?
{25637}{25744}You love her, you always have,|you have a child together.
{25749}{25806}There's no right answer.
{25845}{25962}Look, we've been together.|Then apart. Then together, then apart.
{25966}{26038}And now we have a baby.
{26093}{26208}It's just, if we got together again|and it didn't work out?
{26221}{26299}I could never do that to Emma.
{26330}{26478}I mean, she came into this world|thinking everything... Now me.
{26483}{26573}What, do they put something|in the water here?
{26586}{26672}It's just, Rachel and I,|we're doing really well now.
{26676}{26768}I know. If you try to make it more,|you might wreck it.
{26772}{26842}- Yeah, exactly.|- Right.
{26881}{26982}Or you might get everything|you've wanted since you were 15.
{27191}{27238}Hey.
{27242}{27328}I saw a woman breastfeeding|twins at the same time.
{27332}{27398}It is like a freak show up here.
{27413}{27460}- What's the matter?|- Nothing.
{27464}{27503}What is it? Hey?
{27508}{27611}- Really, it's nothing. I'm...|- Rach, come on. What?
{27629}{27752}I've just been thinking about how|my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
{27762}{27830}What are you talking about?|What about Ross?
{27835}{27983}Please. He'll be with his real family.|The twins and little Miss New Boobs.
{27988}{28064}Okay, how long|was I watching that woman?
{28079}{28141}I'm just saying that, you know...
{28147}{28221}...someday Ross is gonna|meet somebody...
{28226}{28294}...and he's gonna have his own life.
{28299}{28331}Right?
{28352}{28403}Yeah, I guess so.
{28462}{28579}I just never thought I'd be raising|this baby all by myself.
{28584}{28625}That's pretty dumb, huh?
{28631}{28705}Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
{28710}{28809}You are never, ever gonna be alone.
{28814}{28927}Okay? I promise I|won't let that happen.
{28955}{29093}Joey. Oh, sweetie,|what would I do without you?
{29097}{29183}You don't have to worry about that,|okay?
{29270}{29344}Could you grab me my other box|of tissues?
{29348}{29434}- They're under Ross' coat.|- Sure.
{29639}{29709}Oh, my God!
{29721}{29770}Joey?
{29820}{29881}Oh, my God.
{30006}{30057}Okay.
{30892}{30962}- That was amazing.|- I know.
{31005}{31149}Hey, do you realize that we may have|just changed our lives forever?
{31153}{31256}We may have started our family.|In nine months we could be here...
{31261}{31314}...having our own baby.
{31319}{31403}And if not, we got to do it|on a bucket.

{185}{232}Joey?
{268}{318}Oh, my God.
{377}{406}Okay.
{709}{789}So I guess we should|make it official, huh?
{844}{879}Look, Rach, I...
{890}{990}Hey, Ross is here!|Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross!
{995}{1064}- Hey, Ross.|- Hey, Joey.
{1091}{1139}- Hey, you.|- Hey, you.
{1144}{1275}And he brought flowers! Thanks, Ross.|I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.
{1322}{1349}You're weird today.
{1404}{1487}Listen, I wanted to talk to you|about something.
{1491}{1581}Yeah. Actually, I kind of need|to talk to you too.
{1585}{1653}- Joey, could you give us a minute?|- No.
{1695}{1796}- What?|- I'm sorry. I meant, "No."
{1816}{1851}Hi. Hey, look who's here.
{1873}{1951}Where's my granddaughter?|I've been practicing my magic tricks.
{1956}{2023}He pulled a quarter out of my ear.
{2046}{2109}- Hey, where's Mom?|- She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
{2114}{2178}Aunt Liddy's coming?|That means we get $5 each!
{2198}{2322}So when do I get to meet Emma|and show her this:
{2341}{2384}Okay, wow.
{2420}{2482}Emma's in the nursery.|I'll take you now if you want.
{2486}{2571}- But I really want to talk to you.|- I know. I still need to talk to you.
{2576}{2633}But before you guys do that,|I need to talk to you.
{2638}{2707}And, Ross, I need to talk to you.
{2712}{2768}- And I need to talk to you.|- About what?
{2773}{2861}To see if you know|what these guys are talking about.

{4008}{4060}Isn't she beautiful?
{4070}{4151}Look at her, my first grandchild.
{4202}{4270}What about Ben?
{4285}{4385}Well, of course, Ben.|I meant my first granddaughter.
{4509}{4591}Have you thought any more|about you and Rachel?
{4595}{4675}Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her|when you guys came in the room.
{4680}{4783}That's so exciting! Wow.|You could've done that with us there.
{4817}{4859}- Yeah, right.|- Sure. Okay.
{4863}{4943}You can touch yourself in front of us,|but you can't talk to Rachel.
{4947}{5031}What? When have I ever|touched myself in front of you guys?
{5035}{5169}Oh, please. Just before,|when you were asleep in the lounge.
{5173}{5247}That Armenian family was watching you|instead of the TV.
{5300}{5414}That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian|still has my Game Boy.
{5419}{5482}- Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?|- Sure.
{5546}{5588}Dude, I just did something terrible.
{5601}{5657}That was you? I thought it was Jack.
{5675}{5777}No, no. That was Jack.|Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.
{5782}{5893}- What? Why does she think that?|- Because it kind of looked like I did.
{5913}{5946}Again, what?
{5960}{6028}Okay, I was down on one knee|with the ring in my hand...
{6033}{6093}As we all are at some point|during the day.
{6129}{6184}It wasn't my ring.|It fell out of Ross' jacket...
{6188}{6263}...and when I knelt down to pick it up,|Rachel thought I was proposing.
{6268}{6318}Ross had a ring?|And he was gonna propose?
{6323}{6398}- I guess.|- And you did it first?
{6402}{6479}This is gonna kill him. You know|how much he loves to propose.
{6498}{6547}I know. I know. It's awful.
{6552}{6609}Well, what did she say?
{6613}{6654}She said, "Yes."
{6683}{6732}Does Ross know?
{6736}{6807}Oh, my God.|What the hell am I gonna tell him?
{6812}{6872}- Maybe you don't have to tell him.|- I like that. Yeah.
{6898}{6963}If you clear things up with Rachel,|Ross never needs to find out.
{6967}{7037}But you have to do it before|he hears about it and kicks your ass.
{7042}{7118}All right, let's not get carried away.
{7152}{7189}I want a baby.
{7193}{7293}Honey, we've been over this.|I need to be facing the other way.
{7314}{7428}If we have sex again, it'll double|our chances of getting pregnant.
{7432}{7526}- I think that closet's still available.|- I am so tired.
{7630}{7707}- Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.|- Deal!
{7794}{7856}Dad, seriously!
{7887}{7985}You know, you really should|see someone about that.
{7989}{8034}Noted.
{8058}{8155}I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.|Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
{8159}{8264}Are you kidding me?|I could stay and look at her forever.
{8320}{8370}Actually...
{8472}{8511}- Hey.|- Hi.
{8515}{8571}Are you all right?
{8622}{8725}- I think I just got engaged.|- Oh, my God! He did it?
{8730}{8781}What? Did you know|he was gonna ask me?
{8785}{8890}Are you kidding?|I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.
{8894}{8985}I like to think of myself|as the puppet master of the group.
{9017}{9106}- And you really think this is a good idea?|- I just talked him into it.
{9110}{9176}Don't tell me I have to do you too?
{9180}{9268}- The puppet master gets tired, people.|- Okay.
{9273}{9337}I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.
{9342}{9429}Why? You two are so meant|to be together. Everybody thinks so.
{9433}{9492}Really? Even Ross?
{9520}{9591}Especially Ross.
{9649}{9748}Hey, Pheebs. You know what?|I'll come back later.
{9801}{9865}Wow. Kind of a full house here.
{9902}{9986}I guess I'll just... I'll come back.
{10041}{10118}There he goes. Your fiance.
{10149}{10201}I guess so.
{10213}{10266}Although he does|play with himself in his sleep.
{10271}{10344}I can't say I'm surprised.
{10417}{10511}- Dad, what are you doing?|- There are people in there having sex.
{10588}{10668}It can't be me. I'm standing right here.
{10688}{10722}- Wanna peek?|- No!
{10726}{10752}Come on.
{10780}{10850}You know what?|I don't like you without Mom.
{10855}{10904}Come on.
{10920}{10989}We're not peeking?
{11026}{11082}Well, I'm peeking.
{11103}{11171}Oh, my God!
{11179}{11277}Hello, sir. You know Monica.
{11643}{11708}- Hey, is it okay to come in?|- Of course.
{11713}{11807}Joey, this ring, l...|It's beautiful. I love it.
{11838}{11945}Yeah. Look, Rach,|there's something I gotta tell you.
{11949}{11975}- Hey.|- Hi.
{11979}{12081}- Are you ready to try nursing again?|- Yeah. Hi, Emma.
{12085}{12133}Why do you think|she won't take my breast?
{12137}{12194}It's all right.|It takes babies a while to get it.
{12198}{12262}- But don't worry, it'll happen.|- Okay.
{12352}{12445}Okay, sweetie, you can do it.|Just open up and put it in your mouth.
{12458}{12525}Dear Lord.
{12560}{12653}- I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?|- Yeah, look, I think that...
{12657}{12727}Because, look! She's pulling away again.
{12732}{12820}Do you think my nipples|are too big for her mouth?
{12898}{12949}She looks scared.|Doesn't she look scared?
{12954}{13032}You know, I don't really know her.
{13039}{13107}Why don't we try massaging|the breast to stimulate the flow?
{13112}{13194}- Okay.|- Are you kidding me?
{13220}{13288}This is so frustrating.|Why doesn't she want my breast?
{13293}{13374}I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
{13419}{13483}- Hey, wait up.|- Hi.
{13487}{13529}Congratulations.
{13533}{13610}I didn't want to say anything in front|of Joey. I didn't know if he knew.
{13615}{13699}What? That we had a baby?|Now let's give him a little credit.
{13703}{13786}Although he did eat a piece|of plastic fruit earlier.
{13790}{13854}No, no, that you|and Rachel are engaged.
{13877}{13947}- What?|- Oh, it's a secret?
{13951}{14053}Goody. Yes! We haven't done|the secret thing in a long time.
{14066}{14155}Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?|I didn't propose.
{14159}{14185}Are you lying?
{14190}{14296}Is this like that time you tried|to convince us you were a doctor?
{14385}{14442}I am a doctor!
{14484}{14556}You know what? I'm just gonna go|and talk to Rachel myself.
{14560}{14622}All right. Well, me too.
{14678}{14747}- Well, should we wake her up?|- No. No. Come on, let her sleep.
{14751}{14857}- She's so exhausted.|- And so engaged.
{15119}{15209}Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged!
{15233}{15304}Why? Why, why would|she think we're engaged?
{15308}{15382}Perhaps because you gave her|an engagement ring?
{15386}{15451}You know, Ross,|doctors are supposed to be smart.
{15489}{15540}- I didn't give her that ring.|- You didn't?
{15544}{15599}- No!|- So whose ring is it?
{15611}{15658}It's mine.
{15683}{15730}- Is it an engagement ring?|- Yes.
{15735}{15778}- But you didn't give it to her?|- No.
{15783}{15832}- But you were going to propose?|- No!
{15851}{15927}I might be losing interest in this.
{15939}{16020}Look. Look, my mom|gave me that ring...
{16024}{16073}...because she wanted me|to propose to Rachel.
{16077}{16130}But all I wanted to do was see...
{16134}{16226}...if she maybe, kind of wanted|to start things up again.
{16231}{16292}What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
{16317}{16398}I didn't want to rush into anything.|It seemed like she didn't want to either.
{16402}{16474}But I don't understand|how any of this happened.
{16478}{16573}What, did she find the ring in my jacket,|assume I was gonna propose...
{16577}{16658}...throw it on|and just start telling people?
{16663}{16733}No, no. She said you|actually proposed to her.
{16738}{16861}Well, I didn't! I didn't propose!
{16874}{16918}Unless...
{16962}{17006}Did I?
{17112}{17217}I haven't slept in 40 hours and...
{17258}{17370}It does sound|like something I would do.
{17584}{17641}Look, we can't stay in here forever.
{17654}{17725}It's just, I still can't believe|that my dad saw us having sex.
{17730}{17832}He didn't make it to one|of my piano recitals, but this he sees!
{17842}{17936}This is okay. We're all adults here.|There's nothing to be ashamed of.
{17940}{18029}Now, let's put our underwear|in our pockets and walk out the door.
{18178}{18229}Hi, Dad.
{18241}{18368}- I can still call you that, right?|- Of course. I'll always be your dad.
{18372}{18492}I just want you to know that what you|witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.
{18543}{18620}- It wasn't fun?|- Why, why, why would you...?
{18633}{18694}Look, I just don't want you to think...
{18698}{18762}...that we're animals who do it|whenever we want.
{18767}{18807}Well, I don't think that.
{18811}{18903}Before today, I never thought|of you two having sex at all.
{18907}{18970}It was a simpler time.
{18992}{19064}The truth is, Dad, we're trying.
{19073}{19128}- What?|- Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.
{19136}{19185}Oh, my God, this is so exciting.
{19189}{19247}Well, get back in there!|I'll guard the door!
{19251}{19321}That's okay, Dad,|we can wait until later.
{19325}{19376}Whoa! I don't think so.|Aren't you ovulating?
{19389}{19434}Daddy!
{19439}{19477}You gotta get at it, princess.
{19481}{19532}When your mother and I|were trying to conceive you...
{19536}{19598}...whenever she was ovulating,|bam, we did it!
{19602}{19639}That's how I got my bad hip.
{19665}{19764}That's funny. This conversation's how|I got the bullet hole in my head.
{19769}{19855}This one time I had my knee|on the sink, and your mother was...
{19859}{19957}Daddy, I don't think we need to hear|the specific positions you and Mom had.
{19962}{20025}You're right.|This is about your positions.
{20029}{20116}Now, what I saw in the closet|is not the optimum position...
{20120}{20171}...for conceiving a child.
{20175}{20265}- Although it might feel good.|- I don't feel good right now.
{20270}{20363}But pleasure is important,|and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.
{20401}{20447}You up to the task, sailor?
{20452}{20526}Seriously, sir,|my brains, all over the wall.
{20677}{20744}- Hey.|- Hey. Oh, I need to tell you something.
{20755}{20869}Well, now's a good time.|I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
{20876}{20916}Joey asked me to marry him.
{20924}{20969}- What?|- Joey proposed to me.
{20974}{21079}- Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!|- Well, I said yes.
{21084}{21150}What, are you crazy?|You just had Ross' baby!
{21187}{21278}It's so inappropriate.|No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.
{21290}{21348}It is bigger than mine!
{21359}{21457}I know. "Days of our Lives",|thank you very much.
{21461}{21518}- You can't marry him.|- Why not?
{21522}{21606}Come on, I don't want to do this alone,|and he's such a sweet guy.
{21610}{21646}And he loves me so much.
{21651}{21681}Well, do you love him?
{21717}{21743}Sure.
{21786}{21884}- Sure?|- Yeah, I mean, whatever.
{21889}{21955}Honey, the question is...
{21959}{22000}...do you really want to marry Joey?
{22045}{22087}No.
{22091}{22159}No, I don't.
{22213}{22304}Could you be a dear and go tell him?
{22314}{22370}You still haven't told Rachel|you weren't proposing?
{22374}{22431}No. She had the ring on...
{22436}{22509}...she seemed so excited,|and then she took her breast out.
{22525}{22638}Joey, you have to tell her what's|going on. And what did it look like?
{22642}{22701}I didn't look at it.
{22705}{22761}The stupid baby's head|was blocking most of it.
{22785}{22850}Go and tell Rachel right now,|before Ross finds out.
{22854}{22937}Look, it's not that easy.|She said she wanted to marry me.
{22941}{23004}I don't want to hurt her.
{23013}{23069}Okay, look, just do it gently.
{23101}{23126}You're right.
{23130}{23226}You're right. I'll go tell her now|before Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.
{23230}{23332}I can do that. I am a gentle person.
{23336}{23441}By the way, two people screwing|in there if you want to check that out.
{23640}{23678}Hey.
{23683}{23724}Hey.
{23830}{23876}Listen, I heard about the engagement.
{23909}{23942}Surprised?
{23971}{24037}And confused.
{24108}{24187}Rach, sweetie...
{24215}{24253}...I didn't propose to you.
{24287}{24343}I know.
{24373}{24441}I don't think you do.
{24495}{24558}You didn't propose to me.
{24562}{24624}Joey did.
{24630}{24713}Poor baby, you're so tired.
{24738}{24863}Rach, I didn't propose to you.
{24867}{24938}Joey didn't propose to you.
{24942}{25065}And Chandler didn't propose to you.
{25111}{25168}You didn't propose to me.
{25172}{25246}Chandler didn't propose to me.
{25250}{25293}But Joey did.
{25305}{25369}Joey proposed to you?
{25373}{25453}- I can come back.|- Wait. Wait. Wait.
{25458}{25542}- Joey, did you propose to her?|- No.
{25552}{25653}- Yes, you did.|- Actually, technically, I didn't.
{25658}{25741}- Well, then, why did you give me a ring?|- Wait.
{25745}{25899}- You gave her the ring?|- No, and I did not ask her to marry me.
{25904}{25937}- Yes, you did.|- No, I didn't.
{25941}{25970}- Yes, you did.|- No, I didn't.
{25975}{26045}Yes, you did, and don't|you say you didn't!
{26049}{26119}He was right there. He got down|on one knee and he proposed.
{26123}{26180}- You were down on one knee?|- Yeah, that looks bad.
{26184}{26293}But I didn't propose.
{26298}{26363}- Then what did happen?|- Yeah, what did happen?
{26368}{26442}Okay, the ring fell on the floor,|and I went down to pick it up...
{26446}{26527}...and you thought I was proposing.
{26532}{26630}Yeah, but you said,|"Will you marry me?"
{26635}{26680}- No, I didn't.|- Yes, you did.
{26685}{26765}- No, I didn't.|- Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.
{26915}{26977}- Why didn't you tell me that before?|- Well, I tried...
{26981}{27087}...but people kept coming in,|and then you took your breast out.
{27148}{27209}You saw her breast?
{27213}{27312}I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
{27340}{27411}Then what the hell were you|doing with an engagement ring?
{27416}{27478}It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.
{27483}{27594}That's why I felt so bad, Rach,|because he was gonna propose.
{27599}{27632}What?!
{27666}{27708}You were gonna propose to me?
{27839}{27873}No.
{28118}{28160}Well, this is awkward.
{28211}{28351}But I was going to see if, you know,|maybe you wanted to start dating again.
{28355}{28496}- But that, I mean, that was all, Rach.|- Dude, step up. I proposed.
{28500}{28543}No, you didn't.
{28547}{28680}That's right. There's a lot going on here,|and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
{28722}{28858}Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.|Why don't we give this another try?
{28863}{28922}I can't believe you told her|I was gonna propose.
{28926}{29017}- I can't believe you're not gonna.|- Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.
{29022}{29071}Yeah, dude, I totally understand.
{29075}{29158}Usually after I have a baby with|a woman, I like to slow things down!
{29191}{29225}- Oh, my God!|- What?
{29230}{29271}She's doing it!|She's breast-feeding!
{29288}{29356}It's beautiful.
{29361}{29421}- I'll come back for her later.|- Thank you.
{29437}{29579}- Wow, this feels weird.|- What, good weird?
{29584}{29633}Wonderful weird.
{29664}{29733}You know what, you guys?|I'm gonna go too.
{29737}{29839}And I'm sorry about everything.
{29844}{29936}- Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.|- No, Rach, I should've told you sooner.
{29940}{29981}It's just that...
{29985}{30030}Man, that kid is going to town!
{30389}{30441}She's perfect.
{30445}{30499}We're so lucky.
{30504}{30555}We really are.
{30658}{30783}Look, I know it's not a proposal,|and I don't know where you are...
{30787}{30881}...but with everything that's been|going on and with Emma, I'm...
{30885}{30979}- I've been feeling...|- Yeah, I know.
{30983}{31028}I've been feeling...
{31032}{31076}- Yeah?|- Yeah.
{31124}{31195}Okay, well, that...|Wow, okay, well...
{31199}{31287}Then maybe at least we can|talk about us again?
{31330}{31391}Yeah. Maybe.
{31395}{31447}Well, good. Okay.
{31451}{31542}I kind of think, you know, if we, if...
{31609}{31687}You're wearing the ring.
{31812}{31849}What's that?
{31911}{31994}And you told Phoebe|you were engaged.
{32058}{32117}I'm sorry, what?
{32159}{32273}When you thought Joey proposed...
{32280}{32320}...did you say yes?
{32604}{32745}Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up|these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
{32766}{32831}- Hey, Dad.|- Hi.
{32951}{33061}Sorry to bother you again,|but could you pass my pamphlets back?
{33134}{33177}Thank you.

{90}{146}You said you'd marry Joey?
{152}{232}Okay, you have to realize,|I was exhausted, I was emotional.
{237}{277}I would have said yes to anybody.
{282}{383}Like that time|when you and I got married.
{402}{450}I'm not helping.
{458}{564}So you said yes to him,|and you just had our baby?
{570}{665}That is right. And traditionally,|the daddy gives the mommy a present.
{670}{720}But I am prepared to let that go.
{748}{839}So when I came here to see if you|wanted to maybe start things up again...
{844}{924}...you were engaged to my best friend?
{930}{963}Well...
{967}{1006}Really?
{1011}{1073}I thought Chandler|was your best friend.
{1078}{1161}Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.|Joey's my... No!
{1222}{1284}Hey, I'm gonna take off.|I just wanted to say goodbye.
{1290}{1334}Rachel said she'd marry you?
{1360}{1427}This isn't the right room. Sorry, folks.

{2711}{2806}I don't want to be negative. So I'll say|most of the signs you bought are good.
{2881}{3016}No, they ran out of "It's a Girl!"|But I can fix this one.
{3124}{3169}See? Huh?
{3230}{3265}So sexy.
{3294}{3355}- Honey?|- Yeah?
{3394}{3439}- Honey, why don't you lie down?|- It's okay.
{3445}{3539}Ross and Rachel will be back soon,|and then I gotta go to the office.
{3638}{3682}Am I producing them?
{3717}{3778}- Why are you so tired?|- I couldn't sleep last night.
{3783}{3854}I started worrying about this big|divisional meeting I have today.
{3860}{3915}The more I worried,|the more I couldn't sleep.
{3920}{4013}You know, and then I was, like, "If I fall|asleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.
{4018}{4094}But if I fall asleep now,|I'll get five hours' sleep."
{4099}{4153}No matter what I did,|I couldn't fall asleep.
{4159}{4245}You know what you should've done?|Told yourself that little story.
{4306}{4335}- Hi.|- Hey.
{4341}{4374}- Welcome home.|- Hi.
{4380}{4411}Phoebe did the signs.
{4437}{4525}You guys, thanks for doing this.
{4531}{4591}Look at all that stuff people sent.
{4608}{4681}Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something|every mother needs.
{4686}{4791}A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up|the entire apartment.
{4796}{4922}What are people think...?|You guys, I love it.
{4958}{4998}Hey, so where's Ross?
{5004}{5058}He's downstairs getting the stuff|out of the cab.
{5064}{5126}- Is he still mad at us?|- Well, you more than me.
{5131}{5202}But he can't stay too mad at me.|I mean, I just had his baby.
{5208}{5269}That's not fair. I can't do that.
{5284}{5338}I'm not sure you should be here|when he comes up.
{5344}{5441}I didn't think I should be here either.|But somebody said he'd be over it.
{5447}{5508}Hey, what do I know?|I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
{5660}{5747}The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,|New York and London are solid.
{5752}{5863}But many of our field offices|have reported disappointing yields.
{5999}{6063}Boston is down. Atlanta is down.|Houston is down.
{6067}{6133}I could go on and on.|But instead of boring you...
{6138}{6233}...I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.
{6462}{6510}Walter.
{6548}{6602}She's just so cute.
{6609}{6716}I just want to bite her ear off|and use it as a sucking candy.
{6746}{6779}Phoebe.
{6783}{6885}But I could take one of those little feet|and put it in a pita pocket.
{6908}{6990}- Okay. I put most of the stuff away.|- Oh, great. The pacifiers?
{6995}{7063}- It's in the cupboard.|- The burping cloths?
{7073}{7139}- Linen closet.|- The diapers?
{7145}{7178}In the hospital.
{7220}{7337}- Wow, you guys got a hospital? Fancy.|- No, I left the diapers at the hospital.
{7342}{7407}There's some in the bag,|but I'll run out and get some more.
{7412}{7440}All right, thanks.
{7446}{7499}Could you stop at the coffeehouse|and get me a muffin?
{7505}{7585}- Sure. What kind?|- Let me think.
{7590}{7655}What do I want?
{7660}{7721}What do I want?
{7727}{7796}Please, take your time.|It's an important decision, not like...
{7801}{7920}...say, I don't know, deciding to marry|someone. This is about a muffin.
{7981}{8026}- Blueberry.|- Blueberry it is.
{8031}{8087}Thank you.
{8107}{8153}Wow, he's not letting this go, is he?
{8159}{8213}God, how long do you think|that's gonna last?
{8219}{8329}I don't know. He got over the|"We were on a break" thing quickly.
{8344}{8401}You know what,|I can't worry about it right now.
{8406}{8486}Because I've got the cutie little baby.
{8514}{8611}I can't believe how much I love her.|I mean, I can't get enough of her.
{8616}{8675}Like, right now? I miss her.|I actually miss her.
{8698}{8752}You know, that's her?
{8819}{8923}God, look at her sleeping.|I love her so much.
{8929}{8976}- I think I'm gonna wake her up.|- Rach, no.
{8981}{9050}You know, you're never|supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
{9056}{9113}Well, I can do whatever I want.|I made her.
{9151}{9289}Come on, little girl.|Yes. Hello, Emma. Hello. Hi.
{9385}{9481}Well, I would say I told you so,|but she's kind of doing that for me.
{9501}{9575}I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry.|Go back to sleep.
{9580}{9624}Go back to sleep.
{9642}{9739}- It breaks your heart, doesn't it?|- It really does.
{9754}{9820}How long do you think|we have to stay?
{9866}{9922}Okay, if everyone's on board,|it's settled.
{9927}{9987}Chandler?
{10127}{10154}- Chandler?|- Yeah.
{10159}{10217}Are you on board?
{10234}{10285}Yes.
{10292}{10374}Well, then problem solved.|Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.
{10380}{10439}You're gonna love Oklahoma.
{10530}{10618}All right. We already tried feeding her,|changing her, burping her...
{10624}{10721}Try this one. "Go back in time|and listen to Phoebe."
{10774}{10815}- All right, here's something.|- What?
{10820}{10877}It says to try holding the baby|close to your body...
{10882}{10951}...and then swing her rapidly|from side to side.
{10970}{11051}Okay.
{11213}{11243}It worked!
{11296}{11367}No. Just stopped to throw up|a little bit.
{11408}{11441}Mon, what am I gonna do?
{11445}{11531}It's been hours,|and it won't stop crying.
{11560}{11663}- She, Rach. Not it. She.|- Yeah. I'm not so sure.
{11692}{11764}- Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.|- Yeah, no kidding.
{11769}{11859}All right, this just proves no good|can come from having sex with Ross!
{11979}{12078}Hey, Gunther. Can I get a couple|of blueberry muffins to go?
{12084}{12132}- Diapers, huh?|- Yep.
{12137}{12182}So I guess Rachel had your baby?
{12200}{12288}- Yep. Can you believe it?|- Nope.
{12293}{12370}I can't even believe|she slept with you in the first place.
{12441}{12520}You mean, like...
{12672}{12711}Hey.
{12762}{12829}I know you're pissed at me,|but we have to talk about this.
{12835}{12903}Actually, we don't.
{12912}{13005}Fine. Okay. But I gotta say, technically,|I didn't even do anything wrong.
{13044}{13118}What? You didn't do anything wrong?
{13124}{13205}- I said I didn't technically.|- Okay.
{13216}{13270}Let's put aside the fact|that you "accidentally"...
{13275}{13384}...picked up my grandmother's ring and|you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
{13389}{13434}Can I just stop you there|for a second?
{13440}{13473}When people do this:
{13478}{13536}I don't really know what that means.
{13673}{13702}You were saying?
{13708}{13796}And I could even understand|that you couldn't tell Rachel.
{13801}{13898}But why couldn't you tell me?|You had all day to, and you didn't.
{13903}{13999}I know. I should've.|"I'm sorry."
{14133}{14175}Not using it right, Joe.
{14209}{14258}"I'm sorry."
{14332}{14365}- I'm gonna go.|- No, come on.
{14369}{14420}- Ross, we have to get past this.|- Give me the bag.
{14425}{14501}No, I don't know what else to do.|I said I'm sorry, now...
{14506}{14577}Now you should scream at me|or curse me or hit me.
{14582}{14655}- I'm not gonna hit you.|- You'll feel better. I'll feel better.
{14660}{14722}You know you want to,|I can see it in your eyes.
{14753}{14782}- I don't.|- A little bit.
{14787}{14831}- No.|- Little bit.
{14860}{14910}- No.|- A little bit more.
{14917}{14978}- Give me the bag. Give me the bag.|- No, hit me. Hit me.
{14984}{15033}- Give me the bag. I'm not kidding.|- Hit me.
{15039}{15085}- No.|- Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!
{15383}{15462}- You ducked!|- I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
{15468}{15548}- Oh, my God! This really hurts!|- I couldn't help it.
{15554}{15646}When a fist comes at your face,|you duck. Look.
{15697}{15757}What is the matter with you?
{15763}{15811}You were supposed to duck!|Why didn't you?
{15817}{15863}Let's talk on the way to the hospital.
{15869}{15975}Good. Yeah, maybe while we're there,|they can check your reflexes.
{16361}{16431}- Try feeding her again.|- I already fed her.
{16437}{16501}I know. That's why I said, "Again!"
{16529}{16582}You guys,|we can't turn on each other, okay?
{16587}{16640}That's just what she wants.
{16659}{16701}- Hi.|- Hey.
{16707}{16752}- Can I talk to you outside?|- Just stay here.
{16757}{16815}I'm gonna check her diaper.|Pheebs, you want to come?
{16821}{16889}I'm kind of part of this.
{16944}{16999}Actually, it's a husband-and-wife|kind of thing.
{17005}{17063}I knew I should've married Chandler.
{17106}{17167}- Okay, what's up?|- Okay.
{17175}{17241}You know we said it would be fun|to move to Paris for a year?
{17246}{17310}And you could study French cooking,|and I could write...
{17314}{17416}...and we could picnic along the Seine,|and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.
{17421}{17471}- Yeah.|- Okay.
{17476}{17561}You know how people say|that Tulsa...
{17596}{17647}...is the Paris of Oklahoma?
{17709}{17745}What? Who says that?
{17771}{17835}People who have never been|to Paris?
{17852}{17951}- Well, what's going on?|- We're moving to Tulsa.
{18018}{18073}- Excuse me?|- Okay.
{18078}{18144}Ms. McKenna,|she kind of works above my boss.
{18150}{18220}She asked me to move to Tulsa and|be president of our office there.
{18225}{18309}And I was sleeping|and apparently said yes.
{18316}{18400}- Tulsa, Oklahoma?|- The Sooner State.
{18437}{18479}Whatever that is.
{18489}{18564}Chandler, I don't even want to see|the musical "Oklahoma."
{18570}{18637}"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning,"|"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?
{18643}{18749}Are you trying to tell me we're moving|to Oklahoma or that you're gay?
{18791}{18880}All right, not that this matters, but did|they at least offer you a huge raise?
{18886}{18987}No. But they are going to lease us|a Ford Focus.
{19032}{19102}- I'll get out of it.|- Thank you.
{19113}{19157}- What is wrong with Emma?|- She misunderstood.
{19162}{19213}She thought she was moving to Tulsa.
{19323}{19387}Ma'am, do you have a minute?
{19391}{19495}I kind of have some bad news.|I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
{19508}{19621}- What?|- It's a funny story, actually.
{19639}{19719}I kind of fell asleep|in the meeting this morning.
{19724}{19808}So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,|I didn't really know what I was saying.
{19814}{19841}You fell asleep?
{19847}{19911}But only because I was up all night|worried about this meeting.
{19915}{19948}Isn't that funny?
{19993}{20055}Irony. Not a fan? All right.
{20103}{20135}See, here's the thing.
{20141}{20223}I went home and told my wife|about Tulsa, and she won't go.
{20228}{20320}See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.|Tulsa is Italy.
{20325}{20373}Please don't make me go there.
{20379}{20480}- Chandler, l...|- No, look, Carol. Can I call you Carol?
{20539}{20584}Why would I|when your name is Elaine?
{20713}{20773}What a great picture of your son.|Strapping.
{20823}{20896}That's a picture of your daughter,|isn't it?
{20902}{20990}Well, she's lovely.|I like a girl with a strong jaw.
{21055}{21119}I'll call you from Tulsa.
{21216}{21276}Hey. So how is it?
{21281}{21374}- I broke my thumb.|- Your thumb?
{21435}{21501}That's weird.|Are you sure you're punching right?
{21505}{21567}Make a fist.
{21585}{21632}Maybe later.
{21637}{21678}Ross, I feel terrible.
{21683}{21793}You know what, you can go.|I just have to fill out some forms.
{21903}{21946}You want me to help you with that?
{21952}{22042}Why, does it look like I'm having|trouble with my misshapen claw?
{22126}{22175}Name?
{22209}{22277}No, I know Ross.|But what's it short for?
{22282}{22332}You know, like Rossell.
{22346}{22438}Or Rosstrophor.
{22445}{22505}Just Ross.
{22521}{22570}It's pretty.
{22586}{22665}- Okay, date of birth?|- You know my birthday.
{22670}{22721}Sure.
{22730}{22827}May... tember?
{22837}{22961}- October 18.|- Occupation? Dinosaurs.
{22999}{23132}Actually, I'm a paleon...|Dinosaurs is fine.
{23141}{23215}The drawing is not.
{23293}{23371}All right, who do you want|as your emergency contact?
{23397}{23475}- Rachel, I guess.|- Okay. Relationship?
{23480}{23548}Boy, this could take a while.
{23626}{23676}- Just put roommate.|- Come on.
{23681}{23764}You guys are more than that.|You're gonna get together, right?
{23770}{23816}I don't think that we are.
{23868}{23919}But you two are supposed|to be together.
{23925}{24001}Well, I thought so too.|But then she said she'd marry you.
{24011}{24065}Come on, Ross,|that didn't mean anything.
{24070}{24138}She'd just had the baby. She was|freaked out about doing it alone.
{24143}{24239}- She would have said yes to anybody.|- Yeah, that's what she said.
{24244}{24324}- So?|- So I don't want to be just anybody.
{24402}{24439}- Wow.|- You know what?
{24443}{24516}It's better this way anyway.
{24548}{24617}I don't know what I was thinking,|going down that road again with us.
{24622}{24757}It's just much easier if we're|just friends who have a kid.
{24763}{24811}- Really?|- Yeah.
{24816}{24905}- And you're okay with that?|- Yes. That's what we always planned.
{24910}{24970}And if you have a plan,|you should stick to it.
{24975}{25056}That's why they call them plans.|Hello?
{25118}{25159}I'm fine.
{25181}{25222}Hey, for what it's worth...
{25227}{25336}...with Rachel, I don't think|you'll ever be just "anybody."
{25342}{25420}Hey, there you go.
{25449}{25497}"Thanks."
{25622}{25704}Oh, my God.|How long has she been crying?
{25709}{25766}About a week and a half.
{25773}{25882}Well, it looks like you guys got it|under control, so I'm just gonna go.
{25913}{25990}No? Really?|Misery really does love company?
{25995}{26047}All right.
{26069}{26155}- Try holding her a different way.|- Look, I'm doing the best I can.
{26160}{26235}- Anyone else is welcome to try.|- All right, I'll try. Fine.
{26240}{26295}- Yes. Okay. Okay.|- Here you go.
{26300}{26364}Hey. Oh, gosh.
{26369}{26444}Nothing works with this child!
{26449}{26542}God, what am I gonna do, you guys?|I can't even comfort my own baby.
{26547}{26611}- I'm the worst mother ever.|- No, you're just new at this.
{26616}{26693}You'll get better. Think about|your first day at work.
{26698}{26757}That couldn't have been easy,|but you figured that out.
{26763}{26875}Yeah, I don't think dressing|provocatively is going to help me here!
{26881}{26967}- God, just please take her.|- Okay, I'll take her. Come on.
{26972}{27042}Oh, boy,|I have to go to the bathroom.
{27047}{27120}I have to go scream into a pillow.
{27207}{27305}Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.
{27310}{27425}Oh, baby, baby. Oh, baby, baby.
{27430}{27509}Oh, baby, baby, baby.
{27551}{27615}Have I gone deaf?
{27662}{27804}It worked. Oh, baby, baby, baby.|Oh, baby, baby, baby.
{27810}{27872}You must be a fireball in bed!
{27914}{28052}I can't believe it. She's asleep.|I got her to go to sleep.
{28057}{28114}I have actual magical powers.
{28162}{28221}I can hear traffic and birds.
{28226}{28288}I can hear the voices in my head|again.
{28337}{28388}I'm kidding.
{28457}{28548}Oh, my God!|You got her to stop crying!
{28554}{28653}Yes, I did. I'm Monica, super aunt.
{28665}{28775}- You are the official baby-crier stopper.|- Yes, I am.
{28781}{28864}- You're never leaving the apartment.|- Say what?
{28871}{28973}That's your new job, day or night.|She starts crying, I need you here.
{28979}{29067}- No, no, no.|- Thankfully, you don't need me at all.
{29072}{29171}So okay. Hey, super aunt?|See you later.
{29175}{29260}Rachel?|Let's give it six to eight months.
{29475}{29539}Okay, so listen,|I'm gonna go lay down.
{29562}{29586}What?
{29592}{29661}The book says whenever|she's sleeping, I should be sleeping.
{29666}{29699}So...
{29745}{29777}{y:i}Thank you.
{29859}{29903}Hey.
{29908}{30009}- We just got her to go to sleep.|- So there can't be any yelling?
{30059}{30108}No.
{30174}{30249}- We're moving to Tulsa.|- What?
{30328}{30403}I can't... I can't hear.
{30536}{30633}- Hey.|- Hey. Where have you been?
{30681}{30764}- What happened to you?|- I had a little thing with Joey.
{30770}{30823}If you think this is bad,|you should see him.
{30860}{30915}No, Ross, this is not good.
{30920}{31026}We have to talk about this Joey thing.|Please sit.
{31101}{31188}All right, you have got to get over|this Joey thing.
{31200}{31321}Okay? I never really wanted|to marry Joey, okay?
{31367}{31393}Okay.
{31437}{31501}You know what I really, really want?
{31552}{31610}What, Rach?
{31628}{31688}I wanna sleep.
{31714}{31842}I wanna eat.|I wanna take a shower.
{31848}{31947}I mean, before she wakes up,|and we gotta do this all over again.
{31952}{32030}- Right.|- I mean, because I got news for you.
{32035}{32110}Emma: Not easy.
{32132}{32221}Well, that's what I'm here for.
{32303}{32375}- You want me to get that?|- No, that's really okay.
{32380}{32489}- Monica?|- Got it, got it, got it, got it.
{32724}{32811}I've been thinking about this.|And I gotta tell you, it's not my fault.
{32816}{32878}- It's a natural instinct.|- What are you talking about?
{32884}{32952}Okay, what would you do if I did this?

{111}{215}So, what's the big news you had us|rush all the way over here for?
{220}{317}Our news. My company has asked me|to head up our office in Tulsa.
{322}{379}So as of Monday,|I'm being officially relocated.
{384}{425}- Oh, my God!|- What? Monday?
{429}{510}- How long do you have to go for?|- They said it could be up to a year.
{515}{570}- A year?|- Well, do you have to go?
{632}{682}Well, I kind of have to, don't I?
{687}{757}Because of this stupid thing.
{830}{911}There's nothing like the support|of your loving wife, huh?
{916}{971}Wait a minute.|Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.
{976}{1070}Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets|to the Jets game next week!
{1075}{1141}I'm sorry, but I don't think|I'll be able to make it.
{1152}{1221}But we were gonna go see the Jets!
{1269}{1370}You can't go. I mean, you're the glue|that holds this group together.
{1381}{1439}- Really?|- Not you.
{1520}{1574}I can't believe you guys are moving.
{1640}{1693}- I call their apartment!|- No!

{2617}{2670}- Here you go, Rach.|- Thank you, Joey.
{2675}{2757}You know what?|I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
{2762}{2859}I went through this with Ben and Carol.|One coffee won't affect your milk.
{2863}{2957}Just to be sure,|I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
{3046}{3102}Every time?
{3117}{3193}You don't have to call him|whenever you have a question, okay?
{3198}{3312}- Trust me. I know this.|- All right. I trust you.
{3326}{3382}I can see you dialing.|I don't understand why...
{3387}{3471}I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
{3499}{3607}It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel|with a baby. It's just so grownup.
{3612}{3715}I know, yeah.|I feel like we're all growing up.
{3720}{3784}A person named "Wiener."|God, that kills me.
{3808}{3909}- Look at you all grownup.|- Well, actually, you know what?
{3920}{3955}I am, you know?
{3960}{4028}Well, that whole thing|with Rachel made me realize...
{4033}{4120}...that maybe I'm ready for a more|serious relationship, you know?
{4125}{4209}Like, I'd like to meet a nice,|mature, commitment-minded lady.
{4214}{4287}And looks aren't as important as...
{4297}{4334}Nah, she's gotta be hot.
{4358}{4406}You know, I might know somebody.
{4411}{4477}How about you set me up|with someone, and we double-date?
{4482}{4536}I can do that. Yeah.|How's Friday?
{4541}{4565}- Done!|- All right.
{4570}{4621}Good, really?|Okay, let's see.
{4652}{4699}All right.
{4709}{4771}You know who's great?|Sandy Poopack.
{4812}{4855}"Poopack"?
{4920}{5023}Yeah. All right.|Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.
{5132}{5229}- I've got good news.|- You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
{5234}{5293}Okay, I have news.
{5305}{5391}You don't have to move to Tulsa.|You can stay here and keep your job.
{5396}{5429}That's great! How?
{5433}{5516}My boss and I worked out a deal|where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.
{5521}{5571}So the other three,|I can be here with you.
{5584}{5663}So you're gonna be gone|four days a week?
{5688}{5712}No.
{5717}{5795}I'm sorry, are you just|used to saying that?
{5854}{5926}No. I can't be away|from you for that long.
{5939}{5983}- Really?|- Yeah, you're my husband.
{5988}{6091}I won't live in a different state|than you for 208 days out of the year.
{6101}{6217}That's fast math.|We could use you in Tulsa.
{6254}{6382}Thanks for trying to figure out a way,|but if you go to Tulsa, I go with you.
{6393}{6440}You said that without gagging.
{6456}{6511}I know!
{6575}{6615}Well, excuse me?
{6620}{6712}Oh, yeah?|Well, up yours too!
{6735}{6810}- Who the hell was that?|- Dr. Wiener.
{6862}{6943}Rach, you can't call people|at 3:00 in the morning.
{6948}{7025}You know what?|You sound just like his wife.
{7036}{7085}Was there anything|even wrong with Emma?
{7090}{7187}Yes, of course there is!|Okay? I'm not insane.
{7202}{7229}What was it?
{7251}{7299}Hiccups.
{7304}{7405}I told you, you can't call him|every time any little thing comes up.
{7409}{7504}Well, not anymore I can't.|He fired us!
{7544}{7618}What are we gonna do?|We have to find a pediatrician.
{7623}{7685}Wait, Monica said that|when you guys were growing up...
{7690}{7743}...you liked your doctor.|What was his name?
{7752}{7799}Dr. Gettleman?
{7804}{7868}Yeah, no, I don't think|that's a good idea.
{7872}{7927}In fact, I think he's dead.
{7932}{7981}Why does everything happen to me?
{8015}{8089}I promise, first thing tomorrow,|we'll find another doctor.
{8094}{8154}But I gotta get up early,|and I'm not feeling well.
{8159}{8229}You're not feeling well?|What do you have? Rubella?
{8233}{8308}Because don't go near Emma,|she has not had that shot.
{8316}{8407}You know, come to think of it,|it does feel rubella-like.
{8648}{8714}Wiener!
{8718}{8766}Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!
{8771}{8795}Rachel!
{8810}{8876}Great! Now he's gonna|know it was me!
{9028}{9131}So how is this|for our big double date tonight?
{9148}{9191}Oh, my God.
{9224}{9304}Great. Just the reaction|I was hoping for.
{9309}{9396}Yeah, so you found someone for me?|You didn't forget?
{9401}{9459}Of course not.|And you'll love Mary Ellen.
{9464}{9549}She's really smart and cute|and funny and...
{9554}{9682}I can't tell you how I know this,|but she is not opposed to threesomes.
{9709}{9735}All right.
{9748}{9851}- So tell me something about my guy.|- No.
{9887}{9961}Come on, give me something.|What's his name?
{9979}{10053}- Mike.|- Mike. Okay, what's his last name?
{10057}{10159}Damn it! Is there no mystery left|in romance anymore?!
{10164}{10240}We'll see you and Mike|at the restaurant in a couple hours.
{10245}{10339}All right, great.|See you. Bye-bye.
{10344}{10456}Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know|a Mike! Why couldn't I have said...?
{10503}{10577}There's no guys in there!
{10627}{10719}It's impossible to find a good doctor.|How do you know the good ones...
{10724}{10810}...from the ones who'll push|their penis against your knee?
{10844}{10869}Excuse me?
{10874}{10926}I know what she's talking about.
{11032}{11109}Well, we've gotta find|a new pediatrician.
{11114}{11186}Ross was getting sick last night,|and Emma may have caught it.
{11191}{11261}- Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?|- Ross said he died.
{11265}{11339}He didn't die.|I just saw his daughter last week.
{11343}{11473}She said he was fine.|Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.
{11479}{11541}Great. Well then, I'm gonna|take Emma to see him.
{11546}{11589}I wonder why Ross said that he died?
{11593}{11661}Maybe he confused him|with his childhood therapist.
{11666}{11692}He saw a therapist?
{11697}{11767}He used to have a recurring nightmare.|It freaked him out.
{11772}{11821}Wow, what was it?
{11826}{11867}That I was going to eat him.
{12210}{12257}Mike!
{12289}{12330}Yeah?
{12398}{12445}Okay.
{12540}{12594}I can't believe|I'm doing this with you.
{12599}{12657}Although I did just end|a nine-year relationship...
{12662}{12711}...so I should be open|to taking some risks.
{12716}{12757}It'll be fine.|Follow my lead, okay?
{12762}{12809}All you have to do is|pretend to be Mike.
{12814}{12861}- I am Mike.|- Attaboy.
{12937}{12972}Here they come.
{12978}{13029}- I'm Phoebe.|- Phoebe. Mike. How you doing?
{13034}{13105}- Nice to meet you.|- Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.
{13110}{13192}So, Mike, how do you and Joey|know each other, anyway?
{13271}{13328}How do Joey and I know each other?
{13333}{13432}If I had a nickel for every time|somebody's asked me that.
{13450}{13506}- From school.|- We met in college.
{13572}{13631}I mean high school.
{13662}{13765}You guys go way back, then.|So, what are you up to these days?
{13769}{13870}- Well, I'm a lawyer.|- Mike, attorney at law!
{13877}{13936}- Actually, I just gave up my practice.|- What?
{13941}{14036}That's the kind of thing|you usually run by me.
{14049}{14152}I want to play piano professionally.|If I don't do this now, I never will.
{14157}{14214}Great. I like that better|than the lawyer thing.
{14219}{14312}Which is why I waited until now|to introduce you to Mike.
{14317}{14364}You thought he was still a lawyer.
{14369}{14445}No, that's not what I meant.|Let's get you a cocktail.
{14556}{14583}What are you doing?
{14588}{14652}Looking for restaurant jobs|for you in Tulsa.
{14656}{14705}That's so sweet.|Did you find anything?
{14710}{14774}- Slim Pickins.|- Nothing, huh?
{14779}{14874}No. Slim Pickins.|It's a barbecue joint.
{14879}{14966}They're looking for a cook. Actually,|"cook" may be a bit of a stretch.
{14971}{15031}They're looking for somebody|to shovel mesquite.
{15067}{15124}"Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.
{15129}{15197}Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.
{15202}{15268}Honey, that's okay.|I know this woman, Nancy...
{15273}{15345}...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.|She may know something.
{15349}{15413}Can I say how much I appreciate|you coming with me?
{15417}{15534}When we get to Tulsa, I am taking you|for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.
{15549}{15573}So Cheesy?
{15619}{15674}Whole Hog?
{15694}{15783}It's gonna be tough|to keep kosher in Tulsa.
{15882}{15950}Hi, Nancy?|Hi, it's Monica Geller.
{15955}{16087}I'm good. Listen, I'm looking|for a job in Tulsa.
{16096}{16180}Yeah, well, my husband's|been relocated.
{16185}{16245}Because I love him.
{16256}{16313}No, I don't want a job in New York.
{16318}{16394}Javu's looking? Oh, my God!
{16399}{16494}He asked for me personally?|Oh, my God!
{16499}{16581}Wow, this is really,|really flattering.
{16586}{16654}But I'm moving to Tulsa.
{16658}{16720}So, just, if you would tell Javu...
{16725}{16781}...I'll take it!
{16807}{16886}My name's Rachel Greene.|I have an appointment for Emma.
{16891}{16985}Dr. Gettleman is finishing up|with a patient. He'll be out shortly.
{16990}{17076}I think you just have a cold.|It's definitely not strep.
{17081}{17112}Thanks, doctor.
{17181}{17282}- Would you like a lollipop?|- Do you even have to ask?
{17402}{17452}He is alive!
{17566}{17656}It's so surprising that you and Joey|have known each other for so long...
{17661}{17700}...and I've never heard about you.
{17705}{17809}That's because we had|a bit of a falling out.
{17814}{17885}Mike hit my mom with a car.
{17945}{18039}- No, I didn't.|- That's okay. I have forgiven you.
{18044}{18098}Now we're friends again,|and everything's great.
{18103}{18144}Well, wait. Is your mom okay?
{18149}{18241}Please, we're trying|to have a conversation.
{18269}{18321}You're a lot nicer|on "Days of Our Lives."
{18326}{18387}"Days of Our Lives"!|That's why you look so familiar!
{18392}{18418}- What?|- What?
{18423}{18473}What?
{18487}{18553}Do you not know each other?
{18585}{18715}Of course we do. He's playing a game|we used to play in high school.
{18720}{18799}We pretend we don't know each other.|We played all kinds of games.
{18804}{18911}You remember that one where I punch|you in the face for not being cool?
{18949}{19040}Let me ask you something:|How many sisters does Joey have?
{19045}{19144}- Six.|- What are you doing? I said seven!
{19207}{19285}Joey, why did you set me up|with a stranger?
{19290}{19385}Because I forgot about our date.|I'm so sorry.
{19390}{19495}I'm sorry too. And just to be clear,|I didn't hit his mother with a car.
{19510}{19622}You are unbelievable. I spent so much|time finding the perfect girl for you.
{19627}{19699}Mary Ellen is really smart|and cute and loose.
{19753}{19815}Who are you kidding?
{19917}{19991}You find some guy|off the street for me?
{19995}{20043}God, this is humiliating!
{20048}{20147}I'm so sorry. If you don't like this guy,|I can find you a better one.
{20151}{20217}Mike? Mike?
{20241}{20269}I'm out of here.
{20281}{20325}It was nice meeting you.
{20330}{20409}- You're leaving too?|- I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
{20414}{20442}Have a good night.
{20545}{20613}We leave tomorrow,|and you still have a lot to pack.
{20617}{20644}You're right.
{20667}{20708}Maybe I shouldn't go.
{20737}{20784}What?
{20795}{20901}So Nancy told me about this job|at this great restaurant, Javu?
{20906}{20959}But it's just|a little outside of Tulsa.
{20964}{20995}Well, how far outside?
{21017}{21052}Manhattan?
{21104}{21177}And you're thinking of taking it?
{21220}{21305}Before, you said that being with me|was more important than any job.
{21310}{21427}But I guess now it's|old job, me, new job.
{21460}{21511}I'm gonna miss this hand!
{21561}{21601}I know this is a lot to ask...
{21606}{21678}...but, my God, this is|a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
{21683}{21755}What happened to "you can't live|without me four days a week"?
{21759}{21882}Well, if you really think about it,|I mean, four days is not that long.
{21887}{21929}I see you Monday|before you go to work...
{21934}{21975}...and Thursday when you get back...
{21979}{22068}...and I always work late on Tuesdays,|so really if you think about it...
{22073}{22106}...it's really just one day.
{22111}{22230}And well, if we can't make it one day,|we got real problems, my friend.
{22330}{22405}- I think you should take the job.|- Really?
{22410}{22507}I know it must be important to you|when you start chattering like a monkey.
{22562}{22633}That's the nicest thing|anybody's ever said to me.
{22748}{22820}- How was the pediatrician?|- I really liked him.
{22825}{22936}Yeah, yeah.|It was really, really, really good.
{22944}{23027}- You promised not to say anything.|- I know.
{23032}{23109}Ross still sees his pediatrician!
{23148}{23200}I don't care.
{23223}{23300}Are you serious?|You still see Dr. Gettleman?
{23305}{23351}He is a brilliant diagnostician!
{23356}{23445}Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
{23462}{23528}Seriously, you gotta go|to an appropriate doctor.
{23533}{23632}Why? I know it's a little weird,|but he is a great doctor, okay?
{23637}{23678}He knows my medical history.
{23683}{23751}And every time I go in there,|he makes a big deal.
{23756}{23816}You know,|"Look, it's my favorite patient."
{23821}{23910}Does he say that before he sticks|his thermometer in your tushy?
{23915}{24024}I seem to remember someone bringing|his security blanket to college.
{24029}{24099}That was not a security blanket.|That was a wall hanging.
{24103}{24152}It didn't spend much time on the wall!
{24396}{24440}Excuse me.
{24459}{24541}Hi. I was hoping to run into you.|Can we talk?
{24548}{24576}Sure.
{24581}{24668}I'm sorry, really.|I'm so embarrassed...
{24673}{24721}...that our...
{24767}{24875}Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.|Just ask my parole officer.
{24947}{25028}Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.
{25073}{25151}Well, why did you go along with that?
{25156}{25281}Because I was told that I'd get|a free dinner, which I didn't.
{25286}{25362}And that I'd meet a pretty girl,|which I did.
{25420}{25470}That's true.
{25546}{25607}Well, is anything you told me|about yourself true?
{25612}{25683}My name is Mike.|And I do play piano.
{25688}{25778}- Prove it.|- There isn't a piano here.
{25783}{25868}That wouldn't stand in the way|of a true pianist.
{25887}{25920}Okay.
{26315}{26352}You are really good.
{26460}{26542}- I play a little guitar myself.|- Really? That's great.
{26547}{26634}- What kind of music do you play?|- Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know?
{26639}{26754}But right now I'm working on|a couple Iron Maiden covers.
{26793}{26927}Do you think that, maybe,|sometime, I could...
{26932}{26990}It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
{27024}{27113}Okay. You think, maybe,|sometime I could take you out?
{27130}{27182}You just caught me off guard.
{27210}{27253}Yeah, that would be nice.
{27258}{27320}Look at this! My two best friends!
{27449}{27515}Excuse me.|I don't mean to be a jerk...
{27520}{27604}...but the baby with the rash|came in after me.
{27625}{27699}The doctor will be right with you, sir.
{27784}{27833}Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
{27840}{27900}What, the circus?|He's behind the elephant.
{27905}{27994}Wow. So your child's a big fan|of the Waldo books too?
{28051}{28123}Yeah, that's how I know.
{28141}{28213}- I'm Ross, by the way.|- Hi, I'm Sally.
{28217}{28307}So no ring. Can I assume|you're also a single parent?
{28312}{28402}- I am a single parent.|- It's hard, isn't it?
{28407}{28490}There's no time for a social life.|Where are you gonna meet someone?
{28495}{28652}Let's say, I don't know, you met|someone in the pediatrician's office.
{28683}{28738}Rossie? We're ready for you.
{28943}{28978}Yeah...
{29028}{29125}Come on, Ross Jr.|It's time to go in.
{29157}{29204}Mommy.
{29299}{29349}Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
{29354}{29410}Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
{29590}{29664}- Good, you haven't left yet.|- Where have you been?
{29669}{29750}I got held up|at Dr. Gettleman's office.
{29755}{29867}There was some guy|that freaked everybody out.
{29872}{29936}You got here just in time.|I really have to go, buddy.
{29941}{29965}Oh, man.
{29970}{30061}- Promise to call me when you land?|- Of course I will. I love you.
{30066}{30093}I love you too.
{30217}{30310}Watch the tongue, people.|We got a baby over here.
{30323}{30391}- Bye, Chandler.|- Bye.
{30395}{30450}- Bye, honey.|- Bye.
{30557}{30648}- What's the matter, Joe?|- I'm mad at you for leaving.
{30653}{30743}You know, you're nothing|but a big leaver.
{30751}{30832}A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
{30879}{30993}Any chance you're trying to pick|a fight to make all of this easier?
{31060}{31137}Dude, you see right through me!
{31351}{31408}Okay, well... Bye, Mon.
{31425}{31473}Bye, Ross. Rachel.
{31488}{31563}- Bye, Emma.|- Okay, bye-bye.
{31568}{31644}Have a good trip. Okay.|Oh, my God.
{31744}{31787}Wait.
{31822}{31892}It goes old job...
{31897}{31946}...new job...
{31951}{31979}...and you.
{32031}{32079}This is just something I have to do.
{32093}{32142}I know.
{32147}{32202}I love you so much.
{32207}{32269}I know that too.
{32521}{32612}Don't worry.|I'll be back before you know it.
{32617}{32658}Yes, it will be the same.
{32678}{32739}Because I know, that's how.
{32744}{32769}I promise.
{32774}{32805}You double promise?
{32917}{32955}Call me when you land.
{32994}{33050}- Can I talk now?|- Okay, bye.
{33055}{33099}- Joey!|- He had to board.

{70}{97}Hey, Ross.
{101}{189}I'm so glad someone's here.|Could you zip me up?
{255}{289}- Sure.|- Thank you.
{293}{356}Can you believe no one|between my apartment and here...
{360}{412}...offered to do that for me?
{416}{453}People.
{474}{546}So why are you so dressed up?
{550}{603}Mike's picking me up for a date.
{607}{678}How's that going?|Is it getting serious?
{682}{765}I don't know. I don't know.|I mean, I like him.
{769}{849}But am I ready to take|my Grade A loins off the meat market?
{853}{904}I'm not quite sure.
{941}{1037}You know, I really admire|your whole dating attitude.
{1041}{1116}It's so healthy. I'm always like,|"Is this moving too fast?
{1120}{1182}Is this moving too slow?|Where's this going?"
{1186}{1258}I know.|You are a bit of a drama queen.
{1276}{1379}You're so much better off. You just|go from guy to guy having fun...
{1383}{1486}...and not worrying that it|never turns into anything serious.
{1490}{1543}I wouldn't say "never."
{1547}{1602}You know, there is that guy.
{1620}{1667}Okay, well, what about...?
{1683}{1744}Okay, there's gotta be someone.
{1748}{1862}- There isn't! That's what I'm saying.|- Oh, my God, you're right!
{1866}{1953}I know. And yet, here you are,|all ready for the next date.
{1985}{2055}I can't believe I never|realized this before.
{2059}{2161}I'm in my 30s, and I've never been|in a long-term relationship.
{2165}{2232}Oh, my God, what's wrong with me?
{2326}{2368}There's nothing wrong with you.
{2372}{2500}I mean, you don't strike me as the type|of person that wants to get married.
{2504}{2561}I want to get married!
{2565}{2623}No, please...|Please don't cry because of me.
{2627}{2744}I don't know what I'm talking about,|okay? I've been divorced three times.
{2748}{2788}At least you've been married.
{2792}{2875}Oh, my God!|I want to trade lives with Ross?!
{2946}{2993}Phoebe.
{3000}{3068}- What's wrong?|- Nothing. I'm excited about our date.

{3322}{3364}- Ross Geller.|- Hey.
{3374}{3444}So are you sure you're ready to go?
{3469}{3511}How do I look?
{3551}{3633}- Do you have a compact in your purse?|- No.

{4765}{4850}I can't tell if she's hot or not.|What do you think?
{4854}{4952}Joey, I am not going|to objectify women with you.

{5074}{5161}- Have you talked to Chandler?|- He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.
{5165}{5223}- How come?|- I don't know. He has to work.
{5227}{5296}There's some big rush on the...
{5370}{5493}Damn it. I'm gonna have to start|listening when he talks about his job.
{5507}{5577}Why don't you fly out there|and surprise him?
{5581}{5638}Maybe I will go.
{5672}{5768}We'll have a little second honeymoon|at the Tulsa Ramada.
{5772}{5906}You should bring your black see-through|teddy with the attached garters.
{5977}{6076}- How do you know I have one of those?|- Didn't until just now.
{6132}{6187}Hot. Not hot.
{6214}{6252}Hot!
{6269}{6296}Excuse me?
{6376}{6439}I said that I think you're hot.
{6443}{6517}And... now I'm embarrassed.
{6526}{6578}I thought you said "hi."
{6595}{6644}That would've been better.
{6648}{6725}I'll try that. Hi, I'm Joey.
{6729}{6759}I'm Hayley.
{6783}{6909}Look, I don't normally ask out women|that I meet in coffeehouses.
{6995}{7033}Gesundheit.
{7158}{7223}- But...|- I would love to go out with you.
{7227}{7297}Really? Great.
{7301}{7366}Did l...?|Did I actually ask you?
{7370}{7448}That's just where you were going.|I figured I'd help you out.
{7452}{7566}You don't seem like the kind of guy|who does this a lot?
{7634}{7688}You should see someone|about that cold.
{7692}{7763}If it gets much worse, you could die.
{7848}{7914}- So how'd the date go?|- Well, it was awful.
{7918}{7982}Every time I thought about|what you said, I cried.
{7986}{8053}- So he hasn't called?|- Would you call this girl:
{8057}{8134}"Thanks for... a lovely... evening"?
{8157}{8216}Now I feel terrible.|This is all my fault.
{8220}{8281}You know what you should|feel terrible about?
{8285}{8337}This could have been my serious guy.
{8341}{8401}He was sweet and smart and funny.
{8405}{8462}You know how hard it is|to meet a guy like that?
{8473}{8525}We are a rare breed.
{8645}{8686}What a great dinner.
{8690}{8790}Thanks again for letting me have that|last piece of cake at the restaurant.
{8814}{8895}You're welcome again.|I'm gonna go make some coffee.
{8899}{8962}- Can I get you anything?|- Do you have any cake?
{9109}{9161}{y:i}So this is going pretty good.
{9165}{9243}{y:i}Dinner was nice.|{y:i}We've got a lot in common.
{9247}{9296}{y:i}Victoria 's Secret.
{9300}{9343}{y:i}We even like the same books.
{9426}{9465}{y:i}There's a scary painting.
{9485}{9518}{y:i}Wait a minute.
{9522}{9610}{y:i}I think I've been scared|{y:i}by that painting before.
{9642}{9704}{y:i}You know what?|{y:i}This whole place looks familiar.
{9708}{9759}{y:i}I have definitely been|{y:i}in this apartment.
{9763}{9831}{y:i}I know I've seen|{y:i}this weird plant before.
{9852}{9915}{y:i}It did that the last time!
{9919}{9990}"Oh", "my God."|{y:i}I've gone out with this girl before.
{9994}{10051}{y:i}Yeah! We had sex on this couch!
{10055}{10120}"And then on that chair", "and..."|{y:i}No.
{10124}{10169}"No", "we didn 't do it here..."
{10173}{10266}"... which is weird", "because it seems"|{y:i}like a perfectly good place.
{10270}{10308}That's why.
{10501}{10606}Hey, Mike. Sorry to just drop by|like this. Can I come in?
{10610}{10645}Sure.
{10659}{10700}Who are you?
{10712}{10784}I'm Ross. Phoebe's friend|from the coffeehouse?
{10788}{10879}I really, really need to talk|to you about something.
{10883}{10912}Unless...
{10916}{11020}You're not gonna try|and get me to join a cult, are you?
{11053}{11135}No, it's just, you know,|you have that look.
{11149}{11213}Damn Supercuts!
{11263}{11345}- Well, what's up? Is Phoebe okay?|- Oh, yeah, yeah.
{11349}{11427}Phoebe is great. But...
{11431}{11479}I'm an idiot, okay?
{11483}{11592}Right before you guys went out,|I accidentally got her all upset.
{11615}{11649}That's why she was weird.
{11653}{11783}Yes. I said something stupid about her|never having had a serious relationship.
{11787}{11884}But you should know, she is|so much fun. A wonderful person.
{11888}{11988}- Please, don't blow her off.|- I'm not gonna blow her off.
{11992}{12063}I just spoke to her.|We're going out tomorrow night.
{12067}{12189}I mean, I hope that's okay with you,|stranger from the coffeehouse.
{12204}{12272}Well, then, I didn't need|to bother you.
{12276}{12375}You or the four other|Mike Hanigans I bothered.
{12439}{12528}Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.|Is that true what you said?
{12532}{12613}Phoebe's never had|a serious relationship?
{12624}{12667}Of course she has.
{12672}{12732}If she's never had|a serious relationship...
{12736}{12791}...do you think I'd go|around broadcasting it...
{12795}{12900}...like some kind|of unstoppable moron?
{12929}{13028}- But you did say it.|- Yes. Yes, I did.
{13061}{13120}And I will also say...
{13124}{13187}...what I'm about to say...
{13202}{13252}...vis-a-vis...
{13256}{13308}...the following.
{13345}{13475}Phoebe has never had|a serious relationship...
{13486}{13522}...since...
{13526}{13639}...her super-serious relationship...
{13643}{13673}...with...
{13677}{13714}...Vikram.
{13749}{13817}- Vikram?|- What? That's a real name.
{14037}{14078}Stop it!
{14082}{14152}Why couldn't they have|sent me to Texas?
{14174}{14223}Seven o'clock.
{14229}{14279}Maybe I'll hit the gym.
{14418}{14494}Who am I kidding?|Pay-per-view porn.
{14831}{14900}- Do not disturb! Do not disturb!|- Surprise!
{14953}{15017}- Monica?|- Is everything all right?
{15021}{15067}Yeah, everything's great.|I was just...
{15071}{15141}...watching some|regular television there.
{15155}{15222}What a pleasant surprise.
{15402}{15482}- I'm gonna go freshen up, okay?|- Okay, honey.
{15608}{15651}That was close.
{15735}{15770}- Hello.|"- Hey", "Rach", "it's me."
{15774}{15877}Okay, I just got to Chandler's room,|and I caught him...
{15881}{15930}...molesting himself.
{15974}{16024}That couldn't have been pretty.
{16028}{16079}But you know, guys do that.
{16083}{16119}Well, the weird part is...
{16123}{16206}...he was getting off...|to a shark-attack show!
{16217}{16328}- No!|- Yes! Chandler watches shark porn!
{16463}{16513}- While watching sharks?|- Yeah.
{16517}{16573}Are you sure that's what|he was doing?
{16577}{16647}You know how many times|I've seen him jump up like that?
{16651}{16699}Believe me, I know what he was doing.
{16725}{16784}Man! Sharks!
{16788}{16869}I always knew there was something|weird about that dude.
{16886}{16929}You promised to love him|no matter what.
{16933}{17033}"What" means, like, if he|gets a disease or kills someone.
{17045}{17133}Not if he gets his jollies to "Jaws."
{17154}{17207}You know what, honey?|Guys are just different.
{17211}{17273}They like things|that we can't understand.
{17277}{17333}I once dated this guy|who wanted to pretend...
{17337}{17413}...that he was an archeologist,|and I was this...
{17417}{17537}...naughty cavewoman|who he unfroze from a block of ice.
{17578}{17625}Are you talking about my brother?
{17629}{17681}I didn't disguise that very well, did I?
{17751}{17776}- Hey.|- Hi.
{17780}{17879}I went out with this girl last night.|Halfway through our date I realized...
{17883}{17922}...I already slept with her.
{17969}{18076}You've slept with all the women in N.Y.,|and now you're going around again?
{18080}{18116}That's not even the weird part.
{18120}{18220}- She didn't remember sleeping with me!|- You don't remember sleeping with her.
{18224}{18312}But she should remember sleeping|with me. I am very memorable!
{18341}{18387}- You guys know.|- How do we know?
{18391}{18468}- We've never slept with you.|- And whose fault is that?
{18500}{18556}What's the big deal?|You forgot, she forgot.
{18560}{18630}- Maybe you were having an off night.|- Hey!
{18699}{18761}I never have an off night. Okay?
{18765}{18846}Although, sometimes if I'm|a little bloated, I don't feel that sexy.
{18850}{18916}But even then, I'm better than most!
{18936}{19011}Honey, why don't you just let it go|and ask her out again?
{19015}{19086}You're both so slutty, you don't|remember who you slept with.
{19090}{19128}You're made for each other.
{19172}{19219}Interesting.
{19250}{19331}Well, I'll go out with her again|and I'll try to get past it.
{19335}{19399}No salt! Bloaty!
{19403}{19438}- Joey?|- What?
{19442}{19488}You don't think|sharks are sexy, do you?
{19492}{19534}No.
{19542}{19610}Wait a minute.|Wait, what was the Little Mermaid?
{19702}{19752}It's open!
{19765}{19872}- Hey.|- Mike called! We're going out again!
{19947}{20004}Quick thing.|I went to talk to Mike.
{20008}{20040}What?
{20046}{20103}What did you...?|What did you do, Ross?
{20107}{20180}Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.
{20196}{20266}I went over there, you know,|to tell him how...
{20270}{20356}How great you are. But...
{20360}{20425}Well, you know me.|Blah-blah-blah.
{20481}{20570}- And I ended up telling him that...|- What?
{20597}{20672}You had a six-year-long relationship...
{20676}{20727}...with a guy named Vikram.
{20767}{20816}What? Why?
{20820}{20883}Well, he seemed...
{20887}{21029}...to bum hard when I told him you'd|never been in a serious relationship.
{21109}{21177}If you hadn't just had a baby|with my best friend...
{21181}{21262}...I swear to Lucifer...
{21266}{21386}...a rabid dog would be feasting|on your danglers right now!
{21402}{21472}I think you'll feel differently|when you know...
{21476}{21532}...a little bit about Vikram.
{21546}{21594}Okay, he's a...
{21598}{21674}He's a kite designer.
{21721}{21799}And he used to date Oprah.
{21840}{21932}I'm not going along|with some lie you made up, Ross.
{21936}{21994}- I'm just gonna be honest with him.|- Good.
{21998}{22030}Just be honest with him.
{22034}{22094}- I have nothing to be ashamed of.|- No.
{22098}{22205}So I haven't been in a relationship|that lasted longer than a month.
{22209}{22268}Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.
{22272}{22383}If he can't handle it,|then he can leave. Which he will.
{22387}{22474}And, you know, that's okay.|So I'll just be alone forever.
{22478}{22544}You know, all right.|It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
{22548}{22635}I'll go on walking tours|with widows and lesbians.
{22693}{22739}- I'll get it.|- Okay.
{22808}{22907}I'm trying to remember the last time|I opened a door and you weren't there.
{22982}{23046}Phoebe, are you okay?
{23090}{23167}Yeah. There's just...
{23188}{23251}There's something you should know.
{23300}{23372}Vikram just called.
{23404}{23474}So it was really a shock|after 25 years of marriage...
{23478}{23548}...my parents getting divorced.|I took it the hardest...
{23552}{23611}...because I was the youngest.|- Sure. Yeah.
{23615}{23677}How can you not remember me?
{23694}{23719}What?
{23723}{23770}How could you not remember|that we slept together?
{23774}{23846}- What? When?|- I don't know!
{23860}{23939}I really, really think|I would remember sleeping with you.
{23943}{24025}Come on, come on.|Search your brain, all right? It was...
{24029}{24116}...a certain amount of time ago.|I was here. You were here.
{24120}{24179}We had sex here, here, here...
{24183}{24229}Not there.
{24233}{24308}- Anything?|- No, it's not ringing any bells.
{24312}{24364}My God, woman!
{24368}{24437}How many people have you been with|not to remember this?
{24441}{24516}Hey, Hayley.|We really gotta fix that doorknob.
{24558}{24585}Joey?
{24695}{24744}I slept with you!
{24786}{24878}And you obviously remember me!|Hey, I still got it!
{24882}{24935}So we're good.
{24950}{25002}I'll let myself out.
{25045}{25116}And I said, "Okay, Vikram...
{25120}{25203}...you can't just call|every time you get lonely.
{25207}{25290}You gave up that right|when you slept with Rachel."
{25318}{25375}Rachel? I thought she just|had a baby with Ross.
{25379}{25426}Yeah, well...
{25430}{25474}Yeah.
{25482}{25550}But Emma's birth certificate|might say "Geller"...
{25554}{25631}...but her eyes say "Mukherjee."
{25661}{25755}That is so wrong.|And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?
{25759}{25829}I know. But he calls,|and my heart goes to him.
{25833}{25960}You know, that bastard is one|smooth-talking freelance kite designer.
{25991}{26067}I think there's somebody|better out there for you.
{26071}{26159}I mean, you know, I'm...|I'm not saying me, but...
{26183}{26240}Maybe... me.
{26303}{26373}And you don't have to worry about|glue-sniffing with me.
{26377}{26462}Although, I do smell|the occasional Magic Marker.
{26495}{26564}Yeah. Anyway, I just...
{26573}{26630}I think I can make you happy.
{26714}{26772}- Okay, I can't do this.|- What's wrong?
{26776}{26873}Well, there is no Vikram.|Ross made him up.
{26877}{26912}Because I...
{26916}{26986}I really never have been|in a long-term relationship.
{26990}{27099}I've never lived with a guy. I've never|even celebrated an anniversary.
{27103}{27146}So...
{27177}{27247}If that's too weird for you...
{27251}{27303}...and you want to leave,|I understand.
{27307}{27389}In fact, I'll close my eyes|to make it less awkward.
{27567}{27618}You kissed me.
{27679}{27756}- You don't think I'm a total freak?|- No.
{27760}{27800}Well...
{27822}{27857}Look, can I...?
{27861}{27934}Can I think you're a little weird|and also cool...
{27938}{28002}...for telling me the truth|and also want to kiss you?
{28006}{28059}I guess so.
{28063}{28122}Can I think it's cool|that you kissed me...
{28126}{28188}...and also want to kiss you again?
{28228}{28329}And be a little concerned|about the Magic Markers?
{28334}{28380}Definitely.
{28536}{28594}{y:i}This is Vikram.
{28791}{28850}Hi, honey, I'm home.
{28867}{28897}Hi.
{28901}{28987}- How was your flight?|- It was great.
{28993}{29038}Why don't you sit down.
{29042}{29077}Get yourself comfortable.
{29081}{29145}Because I have a little...
{29149}{29203}...surprise for you.
{29229}{29292}Well, well, well.|It must be 5:00 in Tulsa...
{29296}{29388}...because it's "sex o'clock" in N.Y.C.!
{29430}{29534}Okay.|This is how much I love you.
{29559}{29610}{y:i}The great white...
{29746}{29784}Honey?
{29789}{29871}Why am I watching|a bunch of sharks swimming around?
{29899}{29954}Is this...?|Is this not the good part?
{29958}{30064}Do you want me to fast-forward|to something... toothier?
{30074}{30170}No, I'm just not sure that you|got the right movie, that's all.
{30197}{30259}This is the only one|they had at our video store.
{30263}{30338}Though they did have something|called "Crocodile Killers."
{30342}{30409}Or does it always have to be sharks?
{30460}{30509}Does what always have to be sharks?
{30513}{30566}Look, we can do something else.
{30570}{30669}Do you want me to|get into the tub and... thrash?
{30712}{30793}- What's going on?|- It's okay. It's okay.
{30797}{30841}I still love you.
{30845}{30940}- Let me be a part of this.|- Let me be a part of this!
{30974}{31027}I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.
{31031}{31097}Angry sharks turn you on!
{31130}{31168}No, they don't.
{31182}{31283}Then why were you watching them|and giving yourself a treat?
{31297}{31376}Oh, my God! When you came in,|I switched the channel.
{31380}{31443}I was just watching regular porn.
{31471}{31498}Really?
{31502}{31605}Yes. Just some good, old-fashioned,|American, girl-on-girl action.
{31653}{31730}Can I tell you how happy|that makes me?
{31766}{31837}You are an amazing wife.
{31841}{31922}Really, you are amazing. You were|actually gonna do this for me?
{31926}{32029}Where do you find the strength|and the understanding for that?
{32059}{32126}I'm very, very drunk right now.
{32290}{32375}Ordinarily, I would talk to her,|but my confidence is shaken.
{32379}{32455}Did I sleep with her?|Did I not sleep with her?
{32467}{32579}Maybe this is a wake-up call. You know,|about your whole dating attitude.
{32583}{32703}You're in your 30s and you have|never been in a long-term relationship.
{32711}{32757}Here you go from woman to woman...
{32761}{32818}...meaningless experience|to meaningless experience.
{32822}{32910}Never even worrying that it doesn't|turn into something more serious.
{32914}{32989}You're right. I love my life!
{33087}{33146}I actually did sleep with her.

{80}{109}Oh, hey, you guys?
{113}{180}I couldn't get a reservation|for the night of my birthday...
{185}{236}...so we'll have to do dinner|Thursday night.
{241}{359}- Thursday? But that's Halloween.|- So?
{368}{419}It's just spooky, that's all.
{443}{485}So is Mike coming to dinner?
{490}{580}No. It's my first birthday|with a boyfriend, and he has to work.
{584}{681}I'd get mad at him, but I think|it's too soon to show my true colors.
{723}{807}I would make the reservation for five.|One of us has to stay with Emma.
{811}{861}- Which one of us should go to dinner?|- Rachel!
{918}{1015}Actually, I was thinking|maybe both of us could go.
{1088}{1155}Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought|into your gift.
{1188}{1241}All right, so great, we can all go now.
{1245}{1304}That is fun! Hey! You know what?
{1308}{1397}We all haven't been together,|the six of us, in such a long time.
{1402}{1455}What are you talking about?|We're together now.
{1460}{1521}Mon? Chandler's not here.
{1611}{1645}Oh, dear God.

{2597}{2668}Hello. It's nice to see|our team together for the first time.
{2672}{2754}Now, before we get started,|are there any questions?
{2759}{2800}- Yes. Ken, is it?|- That's right.
{2805}{2881}Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,|you fell asleep in a meeting...
{2885}{2957}...and took the job without realizing|what you were saying yes to?
{3009}{3083}Well, don't believe|everything you hear, Ken.
{3087}{3124}But yeah, that's true.
{3157}{3285}All right, let's get started by taking|a look at last quarter's figures.
{3313}{3417}Claudia, aren't you supposed|to blow smoke up the boss's ass?
{3434}{3574}- I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?|- No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.
{3578}{3636}Right now, I can't remember why.
{3652}{3708}You're not allowed to smoke|in this office, right?
{3713}{3799}Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke|in offices with 15 people or less.
{3803}{3891}- Would you like one?|- All right, look. I don't smoke anymore.
{3896}{3974}But if the rest of you want to light up,|go ahead, it's fine.
{4057}{4113}So you all smoke, then?
{4117}{4191}You know, it's almost rude|that I'm not smoking.
{4196}{4253}- That's not true. If you don't want...|- Ken, please!
{4332}{4406}No, I can't. I can't smoke.|If I smoke, my wife would kill me.
{4411}{4465}I'm sorry, but isn't your wife|back in New York?
{4515}{4585}I've always liked you, Ken.
{4714}{4780}Trick or treat.
{4817}{4862}- Hey.|- And "treat" it is.
{4928}{4982}Wow. So glad I changed.
{4996}{5087}I almost wore my threadbare robe|that can't contain my breasts.
{5142}{5191}This is not what I'm wearing.|I'm ovulating...
{5195}{5277}...and Chandler's gonna be home.|So I thought we would try before dinner.
{5282}{5371}Wait, does that...? You guys won't|be late for my dinner, will you?
{5376}{5422}We haven't seen each other|in over a week.
{5426}{5470}We'll probably be the first ones there.
{5496}{5541}Okay. See you there. Happy humping.
{5599}{5634}Hey. Well, hey!
{5644}{5719}Wow, somebody smoked out here?
{5771}{5855}My God, don't people know you're|not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
{5860}{6007}Actually, in Oklahoma smoking's legal|in offices with fewer than 15 people.
{6012}{6055}Oh, you smoked.
{6060}{6174}No. I just happen to know a lot of trivia|about smoking in different states.
{6178}{6288}For example, in Hawaii,|cigarettes are called "lei-lana-lukus."
{6321}{6430}- Oh, Chandler, you stink of cigarettes!|- Do you think Monica will smell it?
{6435}{6519}Are you kidding? That woman|has the nose of a bloodhound.
{6523}{6605}And the breasts of a Greek goddess.
{6687}{6738}Pheebs?
{6754}{6805}I'm gonna go.
{6893}{6977}Okay. Something to cover the smell.
{7054}{7110}Oven cleaner.
{7220}{7279}Unscented.
{7319}{7355}Welcome home.
{7398}{7451}I've missed you.
{7455}{7564}- You want to join me in the bedroom?|- No, thanks, I'm good.
{7576}{7681}Okay. So you want to play it|that way, do you?
{7691}{7751}Well, you know what, actually,|I just got off a plane...
{7756}{7811}...so I'm feeling gross.|I should take a shower.
{7816}{7906}- Come here, you don't need a shower.|- All right, the truth is...
{7910}{7979}...I soiled myself|during some turbulence.
{8071}{8148}What do I smell? I smell smoke.
{8152}{8204}Did you smoke?
{8208}{8277}Yes. But I just had one.
{8281}{8316}Two.
{8320}{8386}Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five.
{8427}{8520}A pack. Two pack... A carton.
{8524}{8584}Three big fat cartons in two days!
{8627}{8699}But it's over. I've made a decision,|I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
{8803}{8838}Well, those are for you.
{8895}{8976}All right. Well, we'll just see you|when you get here. Bye.
{8997}{9067}Oh, that was my mom.|She's stuck in terrible traffic.
{9072}{9138}That is now the third sign|that I should not leave Emma.
{9143}{9215}- What are the other two?|- Well, the first one is, I don't want to.
{9219}{9303}And second one, I'm not going.
{9308}{9369}I know this is the first time|we're leaving the baby.
{9373}{9422}I know how hard it is for you. But...
{9426}{9501}But everything's gonna be fine.|I mean, my mom is gonna be with her.
{9505}{9557}- She's great with kids.|- She is?
{9561}{9612}Yeah.
{9619}{9654}What about Monica?
{9659}{9757}You only hear Monica's side of that.|Okay, that little fatso was a terror!
{9824}{9934}- I just don't think I can do it.|- Know what? You can and you should.
{9939}{9986}Really, it will be good for you.
{9990}{10025}In fact, you know what?
{10029}{10093}Go ahead to the restaurant,|and I will wait for my mom...
{10097}{10186}...and then I'll meet you there.|No, no, really, you should go. Go out.
{10190}{10347}Really, the world is your oyster.|Kick up your heels. Paint the town red!
{10367}{10472}- You need to learn some new slang.|- I'm serious. Come on, you should go.
{10477}{10545}Here. No, just go.
{10549}{10596}- Well...|- No, no! You know what?
{10600}{10696}You're not getting back in there!|The baby's fine. Now, scram!
{10739}{10793}Yeah, tell your story walking!
{10829}{10894}I was just going to say|that I left my keys.
{10979}{11057}Holy moley, are we in a pickle now!
{11142}{11222}Where is everyone?|They're 40 minutes late.
{11227}{11274}- I know.|- I'm starving.
{11279}{11343}I knew we were coming here tonight.|I ate nothing all day.
{11348}{11399}What about me?|I only had one lunch today.
{11442}{11511}So are we expecting|the rest of our party shortly?
{11516}{11572}Yes, they are expected presently.|Yeah.
{11576}{11663}Their arrival is in the offing.
{11673}{11722}Right. We have a table for two available.
{11726}{11766}- Perhaps you'd...|- No, they're coming.
{11770}{11806}We're waiting right here.
{11828}{11876}Joseph!
{11914}{11989}One needn't worry.|They shan't be long.
{11997}{12079}It's just that we do have|some large parties waiting.
{12084}{12154}Oh, one really does have a stick|up one's ass, doesn't one?
{12223}{12299}How can you smoke in this day and age?|Have you not seen that ad?
{12304}{12395}Where the little kid walks|through Grandpa? It's chilling!
{12400}{12468}I messed up. It was a meeting.|Everybody was smoking.
{12473}{12524}So what? Don't you have any willpower?
{12529}{12599}Willpower? I've watched home movies|of you eating Ding Dongs...
{12603}{12647}...without taking the tinfoil off!
{12701}{12759}You said that was sexy!
{12803}{12889}Okay, look, can we just drop this?|I'm not gonna smoke again.
{12893}{12954}That's right, because I forbid you|to smoke again.
{12959}{13007}You forbid me?
{13012}{13066}I've flown a long way|to see my loving wife.
{13070}{13116}Is she here, by the way?
{13121}{13264}Chandler, don't joke with me. Okay?|I'm very, very upset right now.
{13269}{13341}- Is this the most upset you could be?|- I think so.
{13346}{13396}Well, then I might as well...
{13401}{13451}...do this.
{13692}{13758}Not really sure what to do now.
{13789}{13849}I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
{13853}{13915}We're already late|for Phoebe's birthday dinner.
{13919}{13965}So you're going to put out|that cigarette...
{13969}{14037}...we're gonna put this fight on hold,|and go have sex.
{14042}{14115}Fine. What?
{14120}{14188}Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating.|If we don't do it...
{14192}{14244}...we're gonna have to wait|until next month!
{14248}{14296}You're serious?
{14300}{14384}- Oh, yeah!|- All right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking!
{14390}{14460}- And no cuddling.|- And no kissing your neck.
{14465}{14548}Oh, good! I hate it when you do that!
{14590}{14667}And lots of kissing your neck!
{14689}{14730}Okay, well, the super's not home.
{14734}{14795}But my mother's gonna be here,|and she has the key.
{14801}{14878}I can't wait that long. You have to do|something. Knock that door down!
{14883}{14935}I would, but I bruise like a peach.
{14993}{15087}Besides, you know, everything's|gonna be fine. The baby's sleeping.
{15092}{15193}- What if she jumps out of the bassinet?|- Can't hold her head up, but jumped.
{15219}{15265}Oh, my God!|I left the water running!
{15269}{15362}You did not leave the water running.|Please, pull yourself together, okay?
{15367}{15470}- Well, did I leave the stove on?|- You haven't cooked since 1996.
{15482}{15565}Is the window open? If the window's|open a bird could fly in and...
{15570}{15615}My God, you know what?|I think you're right.
{15619}{15653}- Listen.|- What? What?
{15657}{15763}A pigeon. No. No, wait, no.|An eagle flew in!
{15791}{15861}Landed on the stove and caught fire!
{15914}{16059}The baby, seeing this, jumps across|the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.
{16063}{16131}The eagle, however, misconstrues this|as an act of aggression...
{16135}{16176}...and grabs the baby in its talon.
{16180}{16258}Meanwhile, the faucet|fills the apartment with water.
{16262}{16346}Baby and bird, still ablaze,|are locked in a death grip...
{16350}{16466}...swirling around the whirlpool|that fills the apartment!
{16503}{16559}Boy, are you gonna be sorry|if that's true.
{16670}{16711}- Hello.|- Hi.
{16716}{16762}It's been an hour.
{16766}{16862}The maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider|switching to a smaller table.
{16869}{16905}Maybe we should just eat now.
{16909}{16996}You can't order until the entire|party's arrived. Restaurant policy.
{17001}{17071}Well, how about this?|Another table leaves, right...
{17075}{17148}...but there's still some food left|on their plates.
{17152}{17235}Okay, what's the restaurant's policy|about people eating that?
{17240}{17310}- It's frowned upon.|- But it happens.
{17395}{17454}- All right, I got to go to the bathroom.|- You can't go.
{17459}{17512}No, no, no.|I can't hold this table on my own.
{17516}{17565}If they ask me to move, I'll cave.
{17570}{17617}Well, if you ask me to stay, I'll pee.
{17764}{17824}Good evening, miss.
{17845}{17894}Miss?
{17942}{17999}Miss? Miss?
{18003}{18113}Okay, fine, I'll move. All right.|You don't have to manhandle me.
{18137}{18221}Where? Okay.
{18233}{18332}Thank you. Wow.
{18450}{18518}Finally. You guys made it.
{18686}{18718}Pheebs, who the hell...?
{18885}{18967}Spend more time with the tie!|That will make a baby.
{18987}{19090}Look, I can't do this. I can't make love|to you while we're fighting this way.
{19095}{19150}Oh, sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.
{19154}{19218}But when you wanted to have sex|after my uncle's funeral...
{19223}{19273}That was a celebration of life!
{19309}{19352}All right, I'm not gonna do this.
{19357}{19417}Is this the way you want our baby|to be conceived?
{19451}{19511}No, you're right.
{19530}{19569}No, we shouldn't do it like this.
{19645}{19710}For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
{19714}{19793}I shouldn't have come down on you|so hard about the smoking.
{19800}{19893}So you had a few cigarettes.|It's not the end of the world.
{19898}{19960}- Really?|- Yeah.
{19970}{20020}You are incredible.
{20024}{20085}And listen,|I'm not gonna smoke again.
{20089}{20163}And if I do, I promise|I will hide it so much better from you.
{20346}{20381}- Want to?|- Let's celebrate life!
{20385}{20436}Okay!
{20479}{20531}Oh, God.
{20535}{20580}Oh, thank God you're okay.
{20585}{20644}I'm sorry we left.|Mommy will never leave you again.
{20648}{20721}Never, ever, ever again.
{20730}{20770}Great. So let's get going.
{20807}{20886}I mean it. After what just happened,|I'm never leaving her again.
{20891}{20957}I understand. Separation is hard.
{20961}{21057}One time I was about to leave Ross|to go to the beauty parlor.
{21061}{21127}And he got so upset|he took off all his clothes...
{21131}{21209}...tucked his willy between his legs...
{21213}{21329}...and cried out, "Mommy, I'm a girl.|Take me with you."
{21512}{21615}Somehow, over time,|it got easier to be apart from you.
{21738}{21809}You are welcome.
{21838}{21915}- You know what? Let's not talk.|- What?
{21920}{22003}- I am still so mad at you for smoking!|- But you said you forgave me.
{22007}{22078}It was just a couple of cigarettes,|no big deal.
{22125}{22234}I was ovulating and you said you|wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.
{22255}{22392}- You tricked me to get me into bed?|- That's right. I got mine.
{22452}{22520}I feel so used.
{22552}{22634}Well, I guess they're not coming.|You want to just order?
{22651}{22699}Thank you.
{22780}{22861}Waiter? All right, this is gonna|go fast, so try to keep up.
{22866}{22916}Risotto with shaved truffles|and the rib steak...
{22920}{22981}...with the golden chanterelles|and the Bordelaise sauce...
{22985}{23069}...unless any of that stuff I just said|means "snails."
{23077}{23157}- It does not.|- Tomato tart...
{23162}{23209}...and which of the pastas|would you recommend?
{23214}{23281}- Oh, well they're both exquisite...|- Both it is. Thank you.
{23289}{23338}Oh, can I make a special request?
{23342}{23387}Can you bring everything|as it's ready?
{23391}{23440}- Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.|- Hey!
{23512}{23591}- I'll wait to put your order in.|- You guys are over an hour late.
{23595}{23647}- What happened to you two?|- So sorry.
{23651}{23732}- We got locked out of the apartment.|- That's a great story. Can I eat it?
{23757}{23827}And then Rachel wasn't sure|she could leave the baby.
{23831}{23914}It wasn't easy, but it's your birthday|and I did what I had to do.
{23920}{23978}And that's Judy over there at the bar|with Emma?
{24070}{24143}This is for the best. I'm not distracted,|worrying about Emma...
{24147}{24234}...how she's doing at home, and I'm|gonna be completely here with you.
{24239}{24282}- Oh, she spit up. She spit up.|- What?
{24286}{24351}Judy? She spit...|Judy, look alive, Judy!
{24431}{24491}- Thank you.|- Thanks.
{24538}{24607}Oh, everything looks delicious.
{24611}{24702}What should I have?|What should I have?
{24706}{24799}Never hit a woman.|Never hit a woman.
{24820}{24869}I know what you mean,|this menu's incredible.
{24874}{24943}Ross bruises like a peach.|He bruises like a peach.
{24971}{25025}Okay, I'll have the fig salad|and the duck.
{25030}{25073}I'll have the soup and the salmon.
{25078}{25125}Remember, whatever comes up first,|okay?
{25129}{25162}- Hurry...|- Happy birthday!
{25167}{25194}Son of a bitch!
{25222}{25296}- Where have you been?|- Well, we had a little fight.
{25300}{25348}I would never lie|to get someone into bed.
{25352}{25439}You used to tell girls|you were a Kennedy.
{25489}{25535}Thanks.
{25571}{25637}Thanks. Wow.
{25641}{25710}A little tight, isn't it?|Why didn't you get a bigger table?
{25768}{25842}You had a big table|but they made you move.
{25846}{25881}Shut up, Monica.
{25934}{26029}Oh, well, I suppose that Chandler|will have the smoked duck.
{26061}{26185}And I suppose that Monica|will have the manipulative shrew.
{26190}{26250}- I'll give you another minute.|- What, where you going?
{26255}{26318}He said she wanted the shrew!
{26346}{26389}Rach, come on, Emma's fine.
{26394}{26494}You're turning into an obsessive|mother, okay? You need to stop.
{26508}{26623}You ever hear the story about when|Ross' mom went to the beauty salon?
{26654}{26772}- You mean the willy story?|- They already know it.
{26862}{26913}We've been waiting for you|for a long time.
{26917}{26953}- You should order.|- That's okay.
{26957}{27026}- I told the waiter what they want.|- Why would you do that?
{27031}{27087}Chandler, control your woman.
{27107}{27168}Okay, well...|Everybody has ordered.
{27172}{27332}I would like to start the celebration|and make a toast to Phoebe.
{27336}{27417}- She dropped her sock.|- What?
{27432}{27506}- No. No, Emma dropped her sock.|- Mom's here?
{27511}{27607}I wanted to have lunch with her today.|She told me she was out of town.
{27612}{27685}She still has not noticed|that the baby's sock is on the ground.
{27690}{27745}It's a good toast.
{27750}{27813}Look, will you please get her attention?
{27833}{27888}Mommy?
{28105}{28155}Oh, for God's sake, Judy,|pick up the sock!
{28159}{28233}Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!
{28335}{28383}I'm sorry, was that rude?
{28414}{28481}Did my little outburst...
{28486}{28586}...blunt the hideousness|that is this evening?
{28591}{28636}Look, I know you have a lot going on...
{28640}{28782}...but all I wanted to do was have|dinner with my friends on my birthday.
{28786}{28919}And you are all so late, and you|didn't even have the courtesy to call.
{28944}{29023}Well, it's too late now.
{29032}{29069}Pheebs, I don't think that's us.
{29108}{29205}Oh, well, this is... This is not over!|Hello?
{29255}{29346}- What is going on with you two?|- Well, you see, I'm ovulating.
{29350}{29413}Oh, yeah, that's what she says.
{29445}{29552}Maybe you're not ovulating. Maybe|it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.
{29568}{29668}Yeah, Smokey, that's what it was.|I just can't get enough.
{29684}{29725}You're not gonna believe this.
{29729}{29785}She tricked me|into having sex with her.
{29797}{29874}So? You got to have sex, right?
{29885}{29970}What's the matter with me?|Why am I such a girl?
{30000}{30080}- Okay. That was Mike.|- Oh, Phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.
{30084}{30161}You are totally right.|We are here 100 percent...
{30165}{30246}...and we love you, and we are ready|to start your birthday celebration.
{30251}{30327}You guys, that means the world to me.
{30402}{30437}Okay, I'm gonna take off.
{30485}{30515}What?
{30520}{30577}I love you guys too, but|Mike got off work early.
{30581}{30625}Wait.
{30652}{30738}I'm not the... I'm not the kind of girl|that just ditches her friends...
{30742}{30796}...to be with her boyfriend.
{30801}{30831}You know what? I am.
{30854}{30914}Bye, guys. Judy! Bye.
{30971}{31014}If Phoebe's gone,|can we take Emma home?
{31018}{31116}That's a good idea. Our babysitter|just pounded another chardonnay.
{31120}{31150}- Bye, you guys.|- Bye.
{31154}{31256}See you. Well, I guess it's just us.
{31332}{31438}So I'm probably still ovulating.|Do you want to give it another try?
{31444}{31521}So you've never had sex|with a Kennedy, have you?
{31551}{31603}- You're gonna go do it?|- We don't have much time.
{31607}{31659}Once the egg descends into the|fallopian tube...
{31664}{31708}Oh, wait, oh, get out of here!
{31812}{31893}I sincerely hope the rest of your party|is returning.
{31898}{31954}No, just me. All alone.
{32062}{32133}Dinner for six for one.
{32146}{32229}Well, you boys are about|to see something really special.
{32539}{32576}- How was everything?|- Excellent.
{32580}{32663}The shrew, in particular, was exquisite.
{32690}{32729}I hope you've got some room left.
{32936}{32964}Joey. Joey.
{33086}{33111}This is the best birthday ever!

{330}{363}Hello.
{436}{468}Hello.
{479}{511}I love my new job!
{520}{583}- Honey, you're screaming.|- You bet your ass I am!
{587}{634}I just had the best first day ever!
{638}{690}The kitchen?|Twice as big as Allessandro's.
{698}{738}Oh, that's great.
{747}{845}And clean? Not just health|department-clean, Monica-clean!
{862}{887}Awesome.
{896}{953}Oh, and the people are so nice.
{958}{1007}There's this one guy, Jeffrey,|he's the maitre d'.
{1016}{1063}Chandler, you will love him!
{1067}{1163}He is without a doubt|the funniest guy I have ever met!

{2431}{2495}- This is nice.|- I know.
{2713}{2780}- You need both hands for that?|- Yeah, I kind of do.
{2784}{2833}Well, how's this?
{3175}{3250}Look at you two holding hands.
{3259}{3304}Is this getting serious?
{3352}{3400}Have you not talked about it yet?
{3444}{3490}Am I making you uncomfortable?
{3540}{3590}If you were bigger you'd hit me.
{3711}{3737}I'm sorry.
{3741}{3835}It's obviously way too early|for us to be having that conversation.
{3844}{3891}- Is it?|- Maybe not. Is it?
{3920}{3945}When I got divorced...
{3949}{4024}...I didn't think I'd feel this way about|someone for a really long time.
{4028}{4096}Then again, I didn't think I'd meet|someone like you. And...
{4100}{4198}This may be crazy-soon,|but I want you to have this.
{4235}{4280}No, not... That's gum.
{4337}{4413}Oh, five bucks!|I love it when that happens, you know?
{4417}{4467}- You don't know it's there...|- I know. Keep digging.
{4476}{4503}Sorry.
{4612}{4637}It's a key.
{4641}{4722}To be honest, I think I'd prefer|the five dollars.
{4751}{4808}- It's to my apartment.|- Wow!
{4835}{4872}Big step for Phoebe and Mike.
{4876}{4953}I don't want you to feel like you|have to give me your key...
{4962}{5023}- No, I want to.|- Thank God.
{5082}{5169}Wow. I was starting to think|I'd never meet someone that...
{5173}{5216}...I wanted to do this with.
{5239}{5278}Here you go.
{5317}{5371}- This is cool.|- It really is.
{5380}{5512}I know it. It is amazing.|These little things open doors!
{5609}{5659}So I don't go back to work|for another four weeks...
{5663}{5710}...but we would like our nanny|to start right away...
{5714}{5756}...so that Emma could get|a chance to know her.
{5765}{5812}I think that's really smart.
{5816}{5873}The easier we can make the|transition for her the better.
{5877}{5902}That's great. Great.
{5906}{5963}- So do you have any questions for us?|- Not really.
{5967}{6023}All right. Well, thank you|so much for coming.
{6027}{6089}- Thank you.|- It was really nice to meet you.
{6093}{6153}- We will call you.|- Oh, you know, wait.
{6157}{6198}I do have one question.
{6202}{6273}Do you guys do random drug testing?
{6328}{6393}Boy, we hadn't really thought of that.
{6397}{6492}That's cool. But if you do,|I'm gonna need three days' notice.
{6501}{6531}Okey-dokey!
{6572}{6609}We're never gonna find a nanny.
{6613}{6698}Come on, Rach. We will. I promise.|We have more interviews.
{6702}{6801}Worse comes to worst, we can always|reconsider the first one we met with.
{6810}{6896}- What, the blond with no bra?|- She was blond?
{6958}{6983}Just a sec.
{6992}{7050}Okay, this one's name is Sandy.
{7054}{7146}She's got a degree in|Early Childhood Education.
{7159}{7258}She worked for her last family|for three years.
{7312}{7383}Hi. I'm Sandy.
{7463}{7524}And she's a little mannish.
{7702}{7742}Oh, my God! David!
{7778}{7873}- Is this a bad time?|- No, it's a great time! Come in!
{7878}{7928}Wow! Hi!
{7932}{8018}Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?|Are you back from Minsk?
{8022}{8053}Just for a couple of days.
{8062}{8119}I'm here to explain to the people|who gave us our grant...
{8123}{8203}...why it's a positive thing that|we've spent all their money...
{8207}{8273}...and accomplished nothing.
{8289}{8333}Who cares? It got you here.
{8337}{8413}It got me to New York.|Then I got in a cab at the airport...
{8417}{8457}...and the guy said, "Where to?"
{8461}{8552}I just gave him your address.|I didn't even think about it.
{8604}{8636}Where's your luggage?
{8684}{8719}Damn it.
{8757}{8805}All right, I'll call the cab company.
{8810}{8907}We can call them later.|Can you just stand there for a moment?
{8966}{8994}Boy.
{8998}{9066}There's an old Russian expression|that goes:
{9166}{9214}Roughly translated, that means:
{9218}{9296}"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."
{9349}{9381}Thank you.
{9385}{9471}You should see me when...|Actually, no, I look pretty good.
{9496}{9533}Are you kidding?
{9537}{9601}You know, when you don't see|someone for a long time...
{9605}{9664}...you build them up in your head,|you start thinking:
{9668}{9734}"Come on, don't be crazy,|nobody's that beautiful."
{9738}{9798}But, well, you are.
{9844}{9917}Well, so are you seeing anyone?
{9955}{9991}No.
{10026}{10080}I'm just the worst person ever!
{10089}{10146}How can I not tell David|that I'm seeing Mike?
{10151}{10189}Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
{10197}{10276}He said, "Are you seeing someone?"|And I said, "No."
{10306}{10371}Well, that would've been your window.
{10383}{10465}I mean, I don't know.|I was looking in his eyes...
{10469}{10555}...and I was just thinking,|"Oh, my God, it's David. David's here."
{10559}{10617}He's so irresistible.
{10626}{10701}- Really? The scientist guy?|- Really? Chandler?
{10855}{10897}Continue.
{10928}{10953}Then it gets worse...
{10957}{11007}...because I told him|I would see him tomorrow night.
{11016}{11094}- Phoebe!|- I know! Evil!
{11148}{11278}I like Mike so much, you know?|It's just going really well. Oh, my God!
{11290}{11339}Isn't it ironic that David|would show up...
{11343}{11403}...on the same day that|you and Mike exchange keys?
{11467}{11544}Yeah. You know, and given|my lifelong search for irony...
{11548}{11597}...you can imagine how happy I am!
{11647}{11731}- What are you gonna do?|- I mean, I guess I just have to...
{11735}{11819}...tell David that nothing|can happen between us.
{11825}{11878}Unless I don't.
{11882}{11930}You know, complicated moral situation?
{11934}{11998}- No right, no wrong?|- You have to tell David.
{12003}{12093}I knew I should've had this conversation|with Joey.
{12154}{12217}Funniest guy she's ever met.
{12221}{12271}I'm funny, right?
{12280}{12336}What do you know? You're a door.
{12340}{12406}You just like knock-knock jokes.
{12469}{12528}Save it for inside.
{12603}{12715}So Oklahoma's a crazy place. You know,|they call it the Sooner State.
{12719}{12778}Frankly, I'd sooner be in any other state!
{12829}{12888}And what's with Oklahoma|having a panhandle?
{12892}{12933}Can all states have stuff like that?
{12937}{13018}Hey, yeah, I'm from the waistband|of Wyoming.
{13023}{13120}But when I was 7,|we headed over to the crotch.
{13157}{13200}Was your cabin pressurized?
{13233}{13306}And don't get me started on the way|the people from Tulsa talk.
{13325}{13353}Okay.
{13380}{13498}What's with the word "y'all"? You know,|just two words just pushed together?
{13502}{13591}Are we all allowed to do that?|Because if so, I say why stop there?
{13595}{13672}You know, your new poodle|could be your noodle.
{13678}{13741}And fried chicken could be fricken.
{13758}{13815}Waiter? Waiter, excuse me,|I'll have the fricken!
{13889}{13946}See, that's funny with the fricken, right?
{13950}{14043}No, it just reminds me of something|this guy did today at work.
{14047}{14095}I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey,|right?
{14106}{14145}Yeah, he came up.
{14166}{14269}Well, he did this bit.|You probably had to be there...
{14273}{14385}...but it was Liza Minnelli locked|in our freezer eating a raw chicken.
{14503}{14585}- Were you there?|- No, but it sounds fricken funny.
{14656}{14752}I really understand how hard it's gotta be|to leave your child with another person.
{14756}{14835}I mean, it's like leaving behind|a piece of your heart.
{14853}{14939}Sandy, that's exactly what it is.
{14973}{15019}Are you gay?
{15064}{15115}It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.
{15119}{15175}But I am straight. I'm engaged, actually.
{15189}{15254}- Her name's Delia.|- That's pretty.
{15297}{15401}So you're just, like,|a guy who's a nanny.
{15453}{15533}I realize how it's a bit unorthodox|for some people.
{15537}{15634}But I really believe the most satisfying|thing you can do with your life...
{15638}{15674}...is take care of a child.
{15684}{15724}Okay.
{15788}{15821}Like at my last job.
{15825}{15876}I met Daniel when he was|3 weeks old.
{15880}{15967}And I got to watch him grow|into this awesome person.
{15971}{16046}When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon."
{16050}{16123}And he said to me, "Skadandy?"
{16167}{16220}That was his name for me.
{16233}{16345}"I'll see you every day right in..."
{16486}{16581}- It's okay.|- Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
{16688}{16742}Oh, God, she must need|her diaper changed.
{16746}{16859}- I can take care of that, if you want.|- That would be great.
{16919}{16995}I love him, I love him, I love him!
{16999}{17049}Come on. Rach, he's a guy!
{17058}{17108}So what? He's smart. He's qualified.
{17112}{17164}Give me one good reason|we shouldn't try him out.
{17173}{17252}Because it's weird!
{17264}{17291}Why?
{17296}{17355}What kind of a job is that for a man?|A nanny?
{17368}{17433}I mean, it's like if a woman|wanted to be...
{17437}{17468}Yes?
{17514}{17558}King?
{17603}{17688}I hope you don't mind. I used|some of my homemade lotion on Emma.
{17692}{17791}It's a mixture of calendula and|honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up.
{17795}{17870}Plus, it keeps the hands young.
{18033}{18084}Yes! Sandy, you're hired!
{18093}{18138}That's great!
{18231}{18257}I'm sorry.
{18261}{18344}It's just such an emotional thing|when you're welcomed into a new family.
{18352}{18380}Oh, God. Come here.
{18477}{18525}You gotta be at least bi.
{18953}{18993}I need you to set me up for a joke.
{18997}{19056}When Monica's around,|ask me about fire trucks.
{19082}{19180}I don't know, Chandler. I'm not|so good with remembering lines.
{19238}{19299}Thank God your livelihood|doesn't depend on it.
{19303}{19347}I know, right?
{19374}{19407}Why are we doing this?
{19416}{19498}Monica says that her maitre d' is|the funniest guy she's ever met.
{19502}{19598}- Seriously? She actually said that?|- Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?
{19605}{19673}- No! Being funny's your thing!|- Yeah!
{19681}{19763}Without that, you just got|"lame with women"!
{19786}{19814}Hi! There you are.
{19818}{19848}Fire trucks!
{20115}{20213}Wow. You look even more beautiful|than you did yesterday.
{20260}{20315}In fact, I'm going to kiss you now.
{20330}{20390}- Wait, wait.|- I can't get away with stuff like that.
{20394}{20466}It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
{20475}{20523}No, no, it's not that.
{20562}{20653}Remember when you asked me if|I was seeing someone and I said no?
{20657}{20730}Well, I am. His name's Mike.
{20820}{20894}- I should've told you.|- No.
{20912}{20961}Well, yeah.
{20976}{21118}- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.|- Well, it's okay. I understand.
{21124}{21167}Well, are you happy with this guy?
{21175}{21222}- I am happy.|- Damn it.
{21239}{21309}I'm sorry. I don't mean that.|I want you to be happy.
{21313}{21392}But only with me. No, that's not fair.|Who cares. Leave him.
{21396}{21474}I don't mean that. Yes, I do.|I'm sorry.
{21483}{21583}I think I should probably go.
{21593}{21684}But, David, I just want you to know that,|you know...
{21690}{21798}...telling you this is one of the|hardest things I've ever had to do.
{21822}{21868}Well, just so you know...
{21872}{21947}...hearing it wasn't exactly|a Vladnik carnival, either.
{21997}{22103}- Can we at least hug goodbye?|- Of course. Yeah.
{22279}{22368}You know, and a kiss on the cheek|wouldn't be totally inappropriate.
{22372}{22439}- No. No.|- I mean...
{22512}{22544}- In Minsk?|- Yeah?
{22548}{22611}It's two on each cheek...
{22615}{22734}...and one on the lips.|- Well, if that's what they do in Minsk.
{22867}{22923}In New York, it's...
{23132}{23169}Oh, boy.
{23286}{23311}Is everything all right?
{23320}{23368}Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine.
{23372}{23464}Sandy was just telling me about how he|proposed to his fiancee...
{23473}{23513}...and it was so beautiful.
{23522}{23595}Her favorite flower is the camellia.|From the poem...
{23604}{23652}I can't hear it again!
{23656}{23713}You know, I can't tell it again!
{23726}{23774}And I'm fine never having heard it.
{23825}{23938}- Rach, can I see you for a sec?|- Yeah. Excuse me.
{24012}{24138}Do you realize that man has cried|in our apartment three times?
{24149}{24222}I haven't cried that many times|since I moved in!
{24231}{24307}Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.|That's all.
{24311}{24417}Okay, okay. See, that is the problem.|He is too sensitive.
{24426}{24468}Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
{24476}{24573}No, I mean, that guy...|These are amazing!
{24579}{24626}Sandy made madeleines.
{24634}{24709}This is exactly|what I'm talking about.
{24748}{24846}What kind of a guy makes delicate|French cookies?
{24850}{24933}They're not even butch,|manly cookies with...
{24937}{25023}You know, with chunks!
{25097}{25163}Well, you know,|I don't know what to say.
{25167}{25261}I mean, I never thought of you as a guy|who needed his men to be men.
{25265}{25401}I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like you|just came in from branding cattle.
{25477}{25570}Hey, there's sensitive and|there's too sensitive.
{25579}{25643}Okay, what is too sensitive?
{26246}{26310}No, I can't. I can't do this. It's bad.
{26324}{26428}But it's nice. And nice is good.
{26432}{26518}And good is not bad.|Ergo, we should keep kissing.
{26527}{26583}- No, no. No.|- But...
{26605}{26645}Ergo.
{26680}{26751}Look, David, if you had never left, then...
{26755}{26821}...yeah, we'd probably still be together|right now.
{26825}{26980}But you did leave. And I'm with Mike|and I really care about him.
{27087}{27123}Goodbye.
{27315}{27359}The key works.
{27397}{27493}And, you, thanks for the face massage!|Thank you!
{27549}{27629}Did Rachel tell you we hired|a male nanny?
{27638}{27669}I think that's great!
{27678}{27809}Did she tell you he plays the recorder,|recites poetry and bakes madeleines?
{27871}{27988}- How are they?|- Lighter than air, but that's not the point.
{28047}{28101}Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
{28124}{28159}Really?
{28163}{28213}Guys do that?
{28217}{28276}- That's weird.|- Thank you!
{28285}{28334}- That's like a woman wanting to be...|- What?
{28338}{28424}- What's the end of that sentence?|- Yes. What is the end of that sentence?
{28502}{28546}A penis model!
{28683}{28750}Anyway, did you tell Chandler|that some guy from work...
{28754}{28799}...is the funniest guy you ever met?
{28806}{28879}- Yeah. So?|- Wow!
{28897}{28954}Really? Do you not know Chandler?
{28994}{29108}Is that why he's acting so weird?|He's jealous?
{29112}{29140}Oh, my God, that is crazy.
{29144}{29202}- It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.|- So what?
{29206}{29323}Being funny is Chandler's thing.|Like Ross' thing is...
{29436}{29486}Science?
{29492}{29574}Academia? Being a good father?
{29675}{29764}- I can't believe he's that upset.|- You have to do some damage control.
{29768}{29800}Because he's feeling like...
{29874}{29924}What are you guys talking about?
{29947}{30035}Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
{30046}{30121}You got a man who's a nanny?
{30125}{30156}You got a "manny"?
{30388}{30436}You know, I don't mind a male nanny...
{30440}{30484}...but I do draw the line|at male wet nurse.
{30621}{30672}You are on a roll, mister!
{30692}{30763}If I'd known you guys were coming over,|I would've brought more pizza.
{30819}{30918}Okay! Okay! Stop it, you!|You stop it!
{30975}{31019}What is so funny about that?
{31037}{31117}I don't know, it's...|Just the way you say it.
{31121}{31216}I mean, you're funny. You have|that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
{31298}{31364}Did you tell her what we talked about?
{31582}{31673}So those were pity laughs?|Pity laughs?!
{31690}{31746}Honey, listen.
{31755}{31804}You have nothing to worry about|with Jeffrey.
{31808}{31859}Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me?
{31868}{31928}Well, you're different funny.
{31932}{31988}I mean, you're more sarcastic.
{31992}{32078}Well, he does bits and impressions|and limericks.
{32087}{32112}I do limericks.
{32128}{32248}There once was a man named Chandler|whose wife made him die inside.
{32283}{32348}Honey, you know I think you're hilarious.
{32352}{32398}You know that joke|you told me last week?
{32402}{32471}The one about Jerry Lewis|and the girl with the lazy eye.
{32479}{32513}That slayed me.
{32524}{32623}Hey! I made up that joke|and told it to you.
{32712}{32817}- Not knowing when to shut up.|- Yep, that's my thing.
{32943}{33022}So how many guys have your key?
{33049}{33095}It's not as bad as it looks.
{33104}{33149}I was saying goodbye to an old friend.
{33158}{33206}Your lipstick's on his mouth.
{33228}{33299}We just happen to wear the same shade.
{33331}{33406}No, David and I did used to go out.
{33415}{33533}But years ago. And he lives in Minsk.|He's only in town for a couple days.
{33550}{33590}- Did you...?|- No. No.
{33594}{33634}- Kiss him?|- Oh, well, yeah.
{33673}{33748}Yes, but you should know,|she really likes you.
{33752}{33835}In fact, I don't think you realize|just how lucky you are, fella.
{33840}{33896}- Don't point your finger at me!|- Why?
{33900}{33938}What are you gonna do about it?
{33947}{34012}Well, I'll show you|what I'm gonna do about it.
{34016}{34076}- Oh, really? Really?|- You want some of that?
{34169}{34244}Stop it! Stop it!|Before someone gets really hurt!
{34309}{34368}Here, David, you should just go.
{34372}{34403}All right.
{34433}{34546}But if I ever do come back from Minsk,|well, you just better watch out.
{34555}{34628}- Lf I go to Minsk, you better watch out.|- Oh, you're going to Minsk?
{34633}{34701}- Well, I might.|- Really?
{34705}{34785}Well, if you do, come in the spring.|It's just lovely there.
{34794}{34852}Okay, well, guys?
{34884}{34923}- Goodbye, Phoebe.|- Bye.
{34928}{35013}- Hey, what, are you kidding me?|- Right-o. Right-o.
{35102}{35148}Take good care of her.
{35216}{35268}I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
{35272}{35352}If you want your key back,|I totally understand.
{35390}{35464}- It's never gonna happen again, right?|- Right. Never. I swear.
{35555}{35653}I just want to say, if you do ever|come to Minsk, that's my number.
{35657}{35740}We'll party up Vladnik-style.
{36122}{36160}Yeah! All right!
{36169}{36270}Hey, Ross! Check it out!|Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns"!
{36284}{36345}Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice."
{36354}{36420}- "Three Blind Mice" goes like this.|- I swear to God.
{36510}{36598}- Who's up for puppets?|- Me! I'm up for puppets!
{36602}{36670}Well, please welcome:
{36674}{36721}The Snufflebumps!
{36725}{36813}Who wants to be Mr. Wigglemunch and|who's gonna be the Grumpus?
{36817}{36942}How exactly is a 2-month-old|supposed to appreciate puppets?
{36951}{37050}Studies show that the movement and|colors help their cerebral development.
{37054}{37139}The whimsical characters are just for us.
{37237}{37306}I want to be Mr. Wigglemunch!
{37334}{37364}Oh, my God.
{37370}{37435}Well, I guess we know who's|gonna be the Grumpus!
{37568}{37630}- That was kind of rude.|- Oh, I'm sorry.
{37634}{37731}Please apologize to Sandy|and the Snufflebumps for me.
{37745}{37815}- You know, he was just doing his job.|- You know what?
{37819}{37968}I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't|in love with Gary Poppins out there.
{38027}{38089}But I just... I can't go through with this.
{38098}{38133}- Come on.|- No! You know what?
{38139}{38258}I would never force you to hire someone|you were this uncomfortable with.
{38344}{38391}That's true.
{38395}{38423}Thank you.
{38429}{38485}You want to fire him,|so you have to go do it.
{38564}{38693}So you see, Wigglemunch,|that's why it's important to share.
{38749}{38828}I am learning so much from you.
{38946}{38976}Well, I'm off to Tulsa.
{38985}{39063}So if your maitre d' friend|has any funny Oklahoma jokes...
{39067}{39181}...tell him to e-mail me at|www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com!
{39234}{39272}Honey, you can relax.
{39277}{39358}Last night at work Jeffrey|told this really sexist joke.
{39362}{39432}- After that, not so funny anymore.|- Really?
{39441}{39528}See, that's the thing.|You gotta keep it smart, people!
{39558}{39612}Don't miss that flight.|You know I love you.
{39621}{39673}I love you too.
{39678}{39768}- And I like you as a friend.|- Right.
{39772}{39833}- See you later.|- See you.
{39871}{39955}- Did the guy really make that joke?|- No, he still kills me.
{39959}{40062}Last night he had me laughing so hard,|I swear a little pee came out.
{40262}{40290}Here goes.
{40295}{40374}I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
{40485}{40519}Sandy? Hi.
{40523}{40565}- Hi.|- We...
{40569}{40618}We kind of need to talk.
{40714}{40769}I'm afraid it's not working out.
{40892}{41013}I mean, Rachel and I think you are great|with Emma.
{41017}{41095}- We just feel...|- You! You feel!
{41116}{41224}I just feel...
{41228}{41309}...that the chemistry isn't right.|I'm sorry.
{41313}{41377}We're more than happy to give you|a good recommendation.
{41386}{41487}No, that's okay. I had a lot of offers|from other families.
{41491}{41546}I just picked you guys because...
{41550}{41648}...I liked you the best.|- Oh, damn you, Geller!
{41726}{41798}Anyway, well I'm glad|there's no hard feelings.
{41807}{41919}None at all. You need to be happy|with whoever is in your home.
{41924}{42009}Although, if you don't mind telling me...
{42013}{42096}...what was the problem? Maybe it's|something I can work on in the future.
{42113}{42248}No, you know, it's nothing you did.|It's my issue.
{42275}{42313}What is it?
{42372}{42411}Please?
{42497}{42652}You know, I'm just not that comfortable|with a guy who's as sensitive as you.
{42677}{42702}That's fair.
{42727}{42814}Although, can I ask,|why do you think that is?
{42829}{42873}Why? I don't know.
{43058}{43119}Maybe because of my father?
{43223}{43283}You know, when I was growing up,|he was a tough guy.
{43318}{43430}You know, and as a kid,|I wasn't the athlete I am now.
{43461}{43528}I play squash!
{43614}{43748}Anyway, I always got the feeling|he thought I was too sensitive.
{43760}{43792}That must have been hard.
{43829}{43878}It was hard.
{43908}{44033}I remember I was in my bedroom,|playing with my dinosaurs...
{44059}{44091}Playing and learning.
{44155}{44295}And my father walks in and says,|"What are you doing with those things?
{44300}{44442}What's wrong with you? Why aren't you|outside playing like a real boy?"
{44452}{44528}- But you are a real boy.|- I know I am!
{44583}{44706}And when it's summer and it's hot,|why can't you wear a tank top?!
{44739}{44888}It's all right. Crying is good.|It lets the boo-hoos out.
{44920}{44972}Here comes some more!
{45148}{45226}And what's the one kind of boat|that can never ever sink?
{45235}{45350}- What kind?|- A friend ship!
{45395}{45475}Wow! You blow my mind!
{45522}{45571}I gotta go.
{45575}{45618}- How much do I owe you?|- Twenty bucks.
{45633}{45706}It's like the cheapest college ever!

{218}{309}...we really were on a break.|Yes, we were.
{313}{405}Yes, we were.|Come here, gorgeous.
{437}{521}Look at you.|You are the cutest little baby ever.
{525}{617}You're just a little-bitty baby,|you know that? But you've got...
{621}{669}You've got big, beautiful eyes.
{683}{772}Yes, you do. And a...|And a big, round belly.
{779}{870}Big baby butt.
{900}{956}I like big butts.
{1283}{1376}Oh, my God, Emma.|You're laughing.
{1392}{1458}Oh, my God. You've never|done that before, have you?
{1462}{1550}You've never done that before.|Daddy made you laugh, huh?
{1554}{1640}Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.
{1652}{1717}What? What?|You wanna hear some more?

{3150}{3234}- What do you know about investments?|- How come?
{3238}{3332}I'm starting to make good money on the|show, and I should do something with it.
{3336}{3436}- What do you do with your money now?|- It's taped to the back of my toilet tank.
{3440}{3539}I didn't say that.|It's in a bank guarded by robots.
{3577}{3645}- Do you have any ideas?|- A guy at work got me excited...
{3649}{3725}...about going in on an emu farm.|That'd be kind of cool, huh?
{3730}{3816}Pitching in on the weekends,|helping to plant the emus.
{3857}{3943}Joe, emus are birds.|You raise them for meat.
{3948}{3979}Yeah. Right!
{4040}{4092}People eat birds. Bird meat.
{4096}{4180}Do they just fly into your mouth?|Or you go in a restaurant and say:
{4184}{4260}"Excuse me, I'll have|a bucket of fried bird."
{4264}{4339}Or maybe just a wing. Or a...
{4413}{4473}You should consider something|a little less risky.
{4482}{4536}I think real estate is|your best investment.
{4543}{4668}The Fed just lowered the rates, and the|interest on your mortgage is deductible.
{4672}{4729}That's right. I know some stuff.
{4734}{4772}Real estate, huh?
{4777}{4841}And you know who's selling|a great apartment? Richard!
{4845}{4938}And you know whose knowledge of|her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!
{4950}{5055}- My dad told me. They play golf together.|- Well, maybe I'll join them sometime.
{5059}{5123}I just hope the club doesn't|slip out of my hand...
{5127}{5205}...and beat the mustache|off his face.
{5352}{5455}Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.|I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.
{5463}{5528}Wow, the boyfriend's parents.|That's a big step.
{5537}{5648}- Really? That hadn't occurred to me.|- They'll love you. Just be yourself.
{5653}{5718}They live on the Upper East Side|on Park Avenue.
{5722}{5783}Yeah, she can't be herself.
{5787}{5860}Okay, so, all right, which dress?
{5968}{6043}- You can say neither.|- Oh, God. Neither.
{6067}{6127}I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.|It'll be fine.
{6131}{6217}You are in such good hands,|and I am so good with meeting parents.
{6222}{6306}With the father, you wanna flirt a little,|but not in a gross way.
{6310}{6410}Just kind of like, "Mr. Pinzer, I can|see where Wallace gets his good looks."
{6414}{6519}- You went out with Wallace Pinzer?|- He took the SATs for me.
{6541}{6662}- I knew you didn't get a 1400!|- Yeah, well, duh! I mean...
{6670}{6727}So now, what about with Mike's mom?
{6732}{6836}Well, with the mother, just constantly|tell her how amazing her son is.
{6840}{6928}Take it from me. Moms love me.|Ross' mom one time actually said...
{6932}{7002}...I am like the daughter|that she never had.
{7075}{7211}- She said what?|- She's like the daughter she never had.
{7215}{7264}Listen.
{7503}{7569}I just got Phoebe all dressed|to meet Mike's parents.
{7573}{7628}She's so nervous. It's so sweet.
{7632}{7683}Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.
{7696}{7753}You what? And I missed it...
{7757}{7845}...because I was giving a makeover|to that stupid hippie?!
{7863}{7964}Yeah, and it was like|a real little person laugh too.
{7968}{8011}It was like:
{8171}{8251}Only not creepy.
{8255}{8334}- What did you do to make her laugh?|- I...
{8338}{8402}Well, I sang. Actually...
{8406}{8468}...I rapped...
{8475}{8505}..."Baby Got Back."
{8556}{8599}You what?
{8604}{8684}You sang to our baby daughter...
{8688}{8759}...a song about a guy|who likes to have sex...
{8763}{8824}...with women with giant asses?
{8828}{8877}You know what,|if you think about it...
{8881}{8987}...it actually promotes|a healthy body image...
{8991}{9048}...because even big butts...
{9052}{9131}...or "juicy doubles" are...
{9239}{9300}Please don't take her away from me.
{9438}{9517}Hi, come on in.|I'm Catherine, the listing agent.
{9521}{9558}Hi, I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
{9562}{9652}So how come Richard's selling|the place? Went bankrupt?
{9656}{9746}Medical malpractice?|Choked on his own mustache?
{9782}{9874}He's buying a much bigger place.|It's got a great view of Central Park...
{9878}{9916}That's enough out of you.
{9920}{9985}Is there anything we should know|about the place?
{9989}{10097}All the appliances are included.|There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.
{10101}{10201}I think you guys would be|very happy here.
{10336}{10411}No, we're not together.|We're definitely not a couple.
{10416}{10488}- Okay. Sorry.|- That's all right.
{10492}{10569}Wow, you seemed|pretty insulted by that.
{10580}{10634}What, I'm not good enough for you?
{10662}{10746}We are not gonna have|this conversation again.
{10750}{10835}Look at this place.|Why am I so intimidated by this guy?
{10839}{10929}Pretentious art.|This huge, macho couch.
{10933}{10988}When we know|all he does is sit around...
{10992}{11080}...crying about losing Monica|to a real man.
{11084}{11151}- You don't think he's here, do you?|- I don't know.
{11155}{11277}It's a nice place, but I gotta say,|I don't know if I see myself living here.
{11281}{11327}Well, let me see.
{11495}{11550}Yeah, I can see it.
{11569}{11654}Look at these videos.|I mean, who does he think he is?
{11658}{11743}"Magnum Force", "Dirty Harry",|{y:i}Cool Hand Luke.
{11747}{11787}- Oh, my God.|- What?
{11802}{11872}There's a tape here|with Monica's name on it.
{11876}{11972}A tape with a girl's name on it.|It's probably a sex tape.
{12002}{12036}Wait a minute.
{12040}{12095}This says "Monica."
{12125}{12203}And this is Richard's apartment.
{12251}{12283}Get there faster!
{12698}{12748}Wow. You look...
{12762}{12797}...like my mom.
{12832}{12897}I'm wearing pantyhose.
{12926}{12978}- Great! Come on in.|- Okay.
{13064}{13121}Thank you.
{13127}{13203}- Oh, my God. You're rich.|- No, my parents are rich.
{13207}{13290}Well, so? They gotta die someday.|Hello!
{13295}{13334}Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.
{13338}{13405}Phoebe, these are my parents,|Theodore and Bitsy.
{13409}{13445}Theodore, Bitsy...
{13490}{13547}...what a delight.
{13568}{13653}- It's so nice to finally meet you.|- And you.
{13657}{13713}Your home is lovely.
{13727}{13810}Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.|It's actually three floors.
{13815}{13859}Holy crap!
{13903}{13971}Why don't you come meet our friends.
{13979}{14026}Try and stop me.
{14030}{14118}- What are you doing?|- Trying to get your parents to like me.
{14122}{14187}I'm sure they will,|but you don't have to do this.
{14191}{14257}I want them to get to know Phoebe,|not "Phoebe."
{14266}{14324}- You've got it.|- All right.
{14331}{14375}It's hard to stop.
{14401}{14439}Well, come on.
{14443}{14527}Phoebe, these are our friends|Tom and Sue Engel.
{14531}{14618}Phoebe, come sit.|Tell us a little bit about yourself.
{14622}{14687}- So where are you from?|- Okay.
{14692}{14777}Well, all right.|Originally, I'm from upstate...
{14781}{14886}...but then my mom killed herself,|and my stepdad went to prison.
{14890}{15000}So I moved to the city, where I lived in|a burned-out Buick LeSabre for a while.
{15004}{15056}Which was okay. That was okay.
{15061}{15125}Until I got hepatitis, you know...
{15129}{15190}...because this pimp spit|in my mouth and...
{15225}{15259}But I got over it.
{15263}{15383}And, anyway, now I'm|a freelance massage therapist...
{15387}{15492}...which isn't always steady money,|but at least I don't pay taxes.
{15671}{15724}So where does everyone summer?
{15870}{15968}- Oh, God, this is not going well.|- No, you're doing fine. Really.
{15972}{16058}- Why don't you go talk to my dad.|- Okay, okay, okay.
{16062}{16124}- Still sure about me being myself?|- Absolutely.
{16129}{16186}Though maybe just|a little less "pimp spit."
{16320}{16422}So, Theodore, I can see|where Mike gets his good looks from.
{16449}{16481}Well...
{16486}{16600}- You must work out all the time.|- Not all the time. I do the best I can.
{16604}{16662}Yeah, I bet. Look out!
{16674}{16755}- Oh, my God. Are you okay?|- I recently had surgery.
{16768}{16826}- I'm so sorry.|- No, I'll be fine.
{16830}{16904}- I just should check the stitches.|- I really am sorry.
{16908}{17005}How could you know? Why wouldn't|you punch me in the stomach?
{17062}{17126}Did you just hit my dad?
{17130}{17228}Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met|a boyfriend's parents before.
{17232}{17296}But, I mean, you have met|humans before, right?
{17309}{17355}Why don't you go talk to my mom.
{17359}{17440}Okay, yeah, your mom.|She looks nice. I can talk to her.
{17444}{17561}You do that, and I'm gonna go check|my dad for signs of internal bleeding.
{17604}{17709}Bitsy? Listen, I wanted to thank you|again for having me here tonight.
{17713}{17742}Well, not at all.
{17746}{17833}Also, I just want you to know|what a wonderful man your son is.
{17837}{17946}- Thank you. I think so too.|- It's a testament to how he was raised.
{17950}{18023}Especially to you,|because he's very respectful of women.
{18027}{18118}- Is he really?|- He is so considerate of my feelings.
{18122}{18242}You know, I think you'd also like|to know that he is a very gentle lover.
{18335}{18382}Excuse me?
{18386}{18471}No, don't get me wrong.|No, not in like a sissy way.
{18475}{18519}When he gets going...
{18523}{18622}...he can rattle a headboard|like a sailor on leave.
{18677}{18745}That's... my boy.
{18911}{18938}Awesome.
{19030}{19119}I'm not gonna watch it.|I don't need to watch it.
{19123}{19214}I mean, what good could|possibly come from watching it?
{19232}{19296}Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.
{19312}{19397}- Hey, dude, what's up?|- Don't judge me! I'm only human!
{19423}{19453}Did you take that tape?
{19457}{19541}I had to! Lmagine you were married|and you found a tape of your wife...
{19545}{19634}...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't|you need to know what was on it?
{19638}{19707}I don't know. Who am I married to?
{19742}{19777}Some girl.
{19781}{19831}She hot?
{19868}{19941}How did she get me to settle down?
{19952}{19994}All right, I'm gonna watch it.
{19998}{20065}I mean, it's probably|not even what I think it is.
{20069}{20185}Even if it is, it can't possibly be as|bad as what I'm picturing in my head.
{20189}{20232}Can it?
{20237}{20327}See, in my experience,|if a girl says yes to being taped...
{20331}{20418}...she doesn't say no to much else,|I'll tell you.
{20446}{20502}- Then you have to watch it for me.|- What?
{20506}{20600}Just for a few seconds|so I can know what it is. Please?
{20604}{20719}All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,|you have only yourself to blame!
{20831}{20917}- Why am I hearing cheering?|- It's okay. It's just a football game.
{20935}{21012}- It's just football?|- You were all worried for nothing.
{21028}{21074}It's football! It's just football!
{21078}{21159}This is great! This is the first time|I've ever enjoyed football!
{21163}{21237}I think it may be customary|to get a beer!
{21264}{21302}What the...?
{21366}{21459}- What are you doing?|- You don't wanna see what I just saw!
{21463}{21510}What are you guys doing?
{21514}{21583}Oh, my God! Is that Richard?
{21669}{21765}Okay, please laugh for Mommy.|Please?
{21770}{21800}Please laugh for Mommy.
{21917}{21964}Not funny, huh?
{21968}{22015}Well, so is it...
{22019}{22115}...only offensive novelty rap?
{22120}{22212}Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.|Because Mommy can rap.
{22365}{22427}I can't rap.
{22470}{22593}All right, sweetheart. This is|only because I love you so much.
{22600}{22709}And I know that you're|not gonna tell anybody.
{23499}{23563}Emma, you're laughing! You are!
{23567}{23679}You really do like big butts, don't you?
{23683}{23778}You beautiful little weirdo.
{23801}{23872}You missed it! She was laughing!
{23876}{23907}It was amazing.
{23916}{24013}It was amazing. It was the most|beautiful, beautiful sound.
{24018}{24102}I know, isn't it?|What'd you do to get her to laugh?
{24151}{24230}You know, I just...|A couple of things I tried. Different...
{24234}{24291}Just sang a little|"The ltsy-Bitsy Spider."
{24319}{24384}You sang "Baby Got Back," didn't you?
{24392}{24496}Nothing else worked!|That girl is all about the ass!
{24526}{24608}And then it goes back to the chorus.
{24684}{24759}Resolve.|And that's the end of the song.
{24798}{24872}I realize you hadn't asked|to hear it...
{24876}{24937}...but no one had spoken|in 17 minutes.
{24967}{25084}Phoebe writes lots of songs. What was|that one you sang the other night?
{25099}{25129}"Pervert Parade"?
{25189}{25273}- "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?|- Stop.
{25368}{25419}Oh, God. Is that veal?
{25425}{25508}Mom, I thought I told you,|Phoebe's a vegetarian.
{25513}{25607}No, that's okay. That's okay.|I mean, I am a vegetarian...
{25611}{25698}...except for veal.|Yeah. No. Veal I love.
{25703}{25813}- Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.|- Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.
{25832}{25882}But, you know, especially veal.
{25890}{25983}You know, and this nice vein of fat|running through it.
{26346}{26398}Yummy.
{26654}{26692}So...
{26710}{26743}...what do you think?
{26836}{26897}So you stole that tape|from Richard's apartment?
{26922}{26993}Listen to the judgment|from the porn star!
{27025}{27107}That tape was never meant|to be seen by...
{27111}{27205}Joey, I would feel more comfortable|if this conversation were in private.
{27209}{27331}Monica, look, I don't think you and I|have any secrets anymore.
{27357}{27418}Not ready to joke about it yet?|See you later.
{27428}{27519}Why in the world would you take|this tape? And why would you watch it?
{27523}{27580}Because that's who I am. Okay?
{27595}{27685}I'm sure a man like Richard could see|a tape like that and not be bothered.
{27689}{27746}It'd just be another saucy anecdote...
{27750}{27850}...for him to share at his men's club|over brandy and mustaches.
{27866}{27948}Is all of this about you not being able|to grow a mustache?
{27972}{28043}This is about you and Richard.|He's clearly not over you.
{28047}{28115}He keeps a tape so he can|look at it whenever he wants.
{28119}{28209}Isn't that sad?|Can't you see how pathetic that is?
{28213}{28273}Don't be jealous.|You should feel bad for him.
{28277}{28344}Yeah, well, poor Richard, he...
{28348}{28401}I can grow a mustache.
{28431}{28548}This is not our problem. We have|each other. That's all that matters.
{28561}{28676}But I just keep picturing you rolling|around with him, with your...
{28680}{28725}...cowboy boots in the air.
{28751}{28866}Cowboy boots? I've never worn|cowboy boots in my whole life.
{28871}{28950}Good, good. Play more|because I wanna see how it ends.
{28971}{29074}- That's not me!|- What?
{29084}{29158}That's not you! Life is good again!
{29178}{29241}Ride 'em, cowgirl!
{29255}{29338}That bastard taped over me!
{29383}{29436}Is that a problem?
{29447}{29542}It's just so insulting.|Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!
{29601}{29653}I can't imagine what he sees in her.
{29657}{29743}She actually makes me miss|that pill-popping ex-wife of his.
{29788}{29813}Hello, dear.
{29849}{29920}- What's going on?|- We were just chitchatting.
{29924}{29990}- How's your friend?|- A little better.
{29999}{30105}Do you know who's moving back into|town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.
{30110}{30219}You remember her, Michael.|She's lovely, well-behaved and single.
{30224}{30322}- I'm not interested.|- Please, darling, let's be honest.
{30326}{30422}You can have all the sailor fun|you want with that one.
{30426}{30476}- But let's be real.|- All right, stop.
{30480}{30588}All Phoebe has done is try and get you|to like her. Maybe it's not clear...
{30593}{30629}...but she did her best.
{30633}{30752}- She's a little different than you are.|- Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.
{30795}{30876}So what? If I can get past that,|it shouldn't bother you.
{30880}{30957}You don't have to like her.|Just accept the fact that I do.
{30961}{31020}If you can't even be civil|to the woman I love...
{31024}{31117}- The woman you what?|- Yeah, the woman you what?
{31170}{31213}The woman I love.
{31323}{31355}I love you.
{31399}{31511}Something I shouldn't say for|the first time, in front of my parents...
{31515}{31567}...and Tom and Sue.
{31571}{31706}Who are, by the way, the most sinfully|boring people I've ever met in my life.
{31757}{31813}- I love you too.|- You do?
{31862}{31900}How great is this?
{31991}{32028}Wanna get out of here?
{32040}{32142}- Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.|- I had a great time.
{32146}{32245}It was really top-drawer.|And here's something rich.
{32249}{32353}Thirteen bathrooms in this place,|I threw up in the coat closet.
{32358}{32387}Ta-ta!
{32844}{32890}One more time from the top!
{33071}{33144}Rachel, please!|That is so inappropriate!

{140}{199}Hey, hon? Would you help me|get the plates down?
{203}{278}Hey, here's an idea. Why don't|we use our wedding china today?
{282}{358}No, I think we should save our china|for something really special.
{362}{418}Like if the queen of England|comes over.
{432}{504}Honey, she keeps|canceling on us. Take the hint.
{531}{581}What if something breaks?|They're expensive.
{586}{659}What is the point of having them|if we never use them?
{663}{734}Okay. But if something breaks|and then the queen comes over...
{739}{826}- I will explain it to her.|- Like I'd let you talk to the queen.
{871}{945}The parade is really good this year.
{949}{1016}Man, those horses can crap.
{1032}{1092}{y:i}Next up is a marching band|"from Muskogee", "Oklahoma."
{1096}{1171}Muskogee?|That's like four hours from Tulsa!
{1223}{1293}{y:i}Here's the float with the stars|{y:i}of the popular daytime soap...
{1298}{1349}...Days of our Lives.
{1426}{1478}Oh, my God!
{1482}{1575}Aren't you one of the stars of the|popular daytime soap "Days of our Lives"?
{1580}{1651}I forgot! I'm supposed to be there!
{1682}{1772}I can't believe I forgot! I usually write|stuff like this down on my arm!
{1842}{1905}Stupid long sleeves!
{1938}{2007}- What are you gonna do?|- I'll come up with a good reason...
{2011}{2049}...why I wasn't there.
{2053}{2120}The producers are gonna be mad.|They sat us down and said:
{2124}{2245}"Everyone has to be there, 6 a.m. Sharp.|That means you, Tribbiani."
{2249}{2317}Like I was some kind of idiot.
{2362}{2414}Well, you proved them wrong.

{3593}{3647}Oh, Emma.
{3651}{3724}This is your first Thanksgiving.
{3728}{3785}What are you thankful for?
{3789}{3838}Mommy's boobies?
{3857}{3922}A lot of people are thankful for those.
{3980}{4026}Hello? Rachel?
{4031}{4058}Who is it?
{4062}{4136}It's your favorite sister.
{4140}{4197}- Jill?|- Amy!
{4202}{4247}Hide my rings.
{4365}{4442}Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
{4558}{4607}Do you have a hair straightener?
{4636}{4685}Hi.
{4693}{4724}- Hi.|- Hi.
{4728}{4785}Hair straightener.
{4789}{4894}- I haven't seen you in, like, a year.|- I know. I know. I've just been crazed.
{4899}{4976}Well, me too.|I had a baby.
{4991}{5062}I decorated Dad's office.
{5066}{5197}Yeah? Well, unless you pushed a desk|out of your vagina, not the same thing.
{5222}{5285}About that hair straightener,|honey, I really need one.
{5289}{5356}I'm gonna have dinner|at my boyfriend's house.
{5380}{5430}Oh, my God.
{5434}{5491}Is this Emmett?
{5579}{5632}It's Emma.
{5637}{5671}It's a girl?
{5717}{5780}- Hey, Amy.|- Amy, you remember Ross?
{5808}{5853}Not really.
{5857}{5946}But you are much cuter|than that geeky guy she used to date.
{6015}{6062}That was me.
{6074}{6171}No, he was this creepy guy from high|school who had this huge crush on her...
{6176}{6220}...since, like, the ninth grade.
{6224}{6258}Still me.
{6278}{6318}No, I'm not talking about you.
{6322}{6390}It was your fat friend's brother|with that bad Afro.
{6395}{6491}Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save you|some time, okay? All me!
{6611}{6688}Careful. Careful.
{6695}{6740}Careful!
{6749}{6805}I'll tell you what.|For the rest of our lives...
{6809}{6867}...I'll be careful until told otherwise.
{6919}{6979}- This isn't the china we picked out.|- I know.
{6983}{7064}After you left the store,|I chose different ones.
{7079}{7175}- Why?|- Your taste is a little feminine for me.
{7180}{7241}Suddenly flowers are feminine?
{7268}{7338}Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
{7343}{7399}- Happy Thanksgiving. Pheebs!|- What's going on, Joe?
{7403}{7457}Listen, I need a good lie.
{7461}{7494}Okay.
{7501}{7597}How about the whole "man walking|on the moon" thing, you know?
{7615}{7694}You can see the strings, people!
{7699}{7791}No, no, no. I need a good lie to explain|why I wasn't at a work thing today.
{7802}{7862}- Honey, you stink at lying.|- I do not.
{7867}{7947}Really? Let me ask you something.|Yesterday at the coffeehouse...
{7951}{8039}...I went to the bathroom. When I came|back, my muffin was gone. Who took it?
{8074}{8127}Somebody opened the door|to the coffeehouse...
{8131}{8226}...and a raccoon ran in and went|straight for your muffin. I said:
{8230}{8309}"Hey, don't eat that!|That's Phoebe's! " And he said...
{8363}{8454}He said, "Joey, you stink at lying."|What am I gonna do?
{8458}{8523}Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.|I'll help you.
{8528}{8623}- Great. That'd be great. Thank you.|- Sure. What was the work thing?
{8659}{8733}- "Pick up Grandma at the airport."|- Oh, man!
{8811}{8866}She's precious.
{8878}{8968}Do you ever worry|that she's gonna get your real nose?
{8972}{9018}Amy...
{9045}{9102}Yes, I do. I really do.
{9208}{9246}Hello?
{9250}{9335}Yeah, hang on, one sec.|Can I take this upstairs?
{9339}{9393}Sure. We don't live there, but...
{9417}{9512}Seriously? It's just these rooms?
{9529}{9621}- I thought you were a doctor.|- Yeah. No, Ross has a Ph.D.
{9759}{9839}God, she is unbelievable.
{9844}{9918}I know. I mean, a Ph.D.|Is just as good as an MD.
{9923}{9965}Sure, Ross, yeah!
{9969}{10075}If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,|I want you there with your fossil brush.
{10122}{10172}- Stupid Thanksgiving.|- What?
{10176}{10252}- What? What happened?|- My boyfriend canceled on me.
{10256}{10316}I mean, I finally find a real relationship.
{10320}{10439}Someone that I can spend this day with,|and then his wife comes back into town!
{10443}{10521}I swear, it's almost not even|worth dating married guys.
{10532}{10574}Don't say that.
{10608}{10667}God, I was so looking forward to this.
{10671}{10744}It was gonna be such|a beautiful Thanksgiving.
{10748}{10806}We were gonna have sushi.
{10835}{10899}Amy, don't cry.
{10927}{11016}- Ross, can I talk to you in private?|- Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or...?
{11133}{11205}Look, I was thinking,|if it's okay with Monica...
{11209}{11271}...I would like to invite Amy|to Thanksgiving.
{11279}{11421}I think that's a great idea. It'll be like|the Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
{11453}{11523}Look, I know she's a little tough to take.
{11527}{11631}But she has nowhere else to go,|and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.
{11635}{11755}- And I would like them to bond.|- I don't want them bonding too much.
{11759}{11820}I don't want her telling Emma|she needs a nose job.
{11825}{11920}Ross, she may need one. We're just|gonna have to make our peace with that!
{12097}{12140}- Hi!|- Hey.
{12144}{12221}Hey, you guys. This is my sister, Amy.
{12225}{12323}This is Chandler, Joey,|Phoebe, and you know Mon.
{12328}{12364}Oh, my God.
{12368}{12421}You're on "Days of our Lives"!
{12425}{12458}Yeah.
{12462}{12544}Wow! They must put|a lot of makeup on you.
{12596}{12652}Happy Thanksgiving.
{12677}{12721}- Hey.|- Hi.
{12777}{12850}So welcome. Is this the first time|you're seeing Emma?
{12855}{12930}Yeah, I think so.|It's nice to meet you, Emma.
{12983}{13063}- Phoebe.|- That's a funny noise.
{13152}{13244}- Pheebs? I still need some help here.|- Right. Okay.
{13248}{13354}So it's not just the lie you tell,|but it's the way you tell it. For example...
{13358}{13438}...if you look at the ground when|you talk, people know you're lying.
{13458}{13555}I don't know why this is so hard for me.|Lying is basically just acting...
{13559}{13641}...and I am a terrific actor.|- You are a terrific actor.
{13709}{13803}- Hey. Where's the baby?|- We just put her down for a nap.
{13807}{13896}Listen, I was just thinking.|You know what would be incredible?
{13901}{13966}If you guys died!
{13997}{14050}Thank you, Amy.
{14055}{14123}No, no, then I would get the baby.
{14127}{14231}It would be just like a movie. At first|I wouldn't know what to do with her.
{14235}{14334}And then I would rise to the occasion.|Then I'd get a makeover and get married.
{14339}{14395}That's a great movie!
{14432}{14506}Yeah. Listen, not that you guys|could stop me or anything...
{14511}{14568}...because you know, you'd be dead.
{14572}{14627}But I was thinking about|changing her name.
{14631}{14689}I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
{14728}{14767}Emma.
{14783}{14831}Emma? Ross wants you.
{14887}{14937}Phoebe!
{14968}{15040}Why does she keep making that noise?
{15101}{15157}Honey, I don't know|how to tell you this...
{15161}{15265}...but if something were to happen|to Ross or myself...
{15270}{15348}...you wouldn't get the baby.|- Well, who would?
{15364}{15451}Well, we haven't officially|asked them yet...
{15455}{15520}...but we would want|Monica and Chandler.
{15524}{15579}I can't believe you'd want us|to raise Emma.
{15583}{15629}Oh, my God, I'm so moved.
{15634}{15698}I don't believe this. Hold on a second.|You guys die...
{15702}{15762}...and I don't get your baby?
{15767}{15847}Amy, see, we're a lot closer|to Monica and Chandler.
{15851}{15953}We see them every day. And truthfully,|you don't seem connected to the baby.
{15958}{16044}Connected? To what? She's a lump.
{16107}{16175}You know, guys, I've gotta say|this means so much to me.
{16180}{16259}I mean, that you would|trust me with your child.
{16263}{16326}I mean, we all know|that Monica and I have been...
{16330}{16386}...trying to have a baby of our own.
{16390}{16515}You know, I've had my doubts|about my skills as a father, but...
{16551}{16601}That you two...
{16614}{16689}- That you two...|- This guy?
{16719}{16756}Seriously?
{16886}{16939}Okay, it's time for dinner.
{16943}{17008}Everyone, we're using our fancy china...
{17012}{17106}...and it's very expensive,|so please be careful.
{17270}{17359}Okay, just to be clear, comedy with|the plates will not be well-received.
{17542}{17585}Hey!
{17589}{17683}How come my plate's less fancy|than everyone else's?
{17710}{17772}Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
{17776}{17851}No, honey. That's a special plate.
{17855}{17944}See, it's a game.|Whoever gets that plate wins.
{17981}{18048}I can't believe I won!
{18071}{18150}You know, this is such a slap|in the face. I mean, I'm your sister...
{18154}{18249}...and you would give your baby|to these strangers over me.
{18254}{18314}Monica is Ross' sister.
{18327}{18418}No, Ross' sister was really fat.
{18455}{18489}That was me.
{18506}{18613}No, she was this dorky girl in school who|followed Rachel around like a puppy...
{18619}{18674}Amy, you've got to stop doing that!
{18820}{18889}Okay, listen, I know you're having|a bit of a family crisis...
{18893}{18955}...but you don't have to take it out|on the plates.
{18959}{19027}I mean, in fact, I think that everyone...
{19031}{19125}...should cut their food like this:
{19180}{19250}Now, see? This way,|you protect the plates...
{19258}{19304}...and let's face it, you have fun.
{19346}{19413}Okay, how about this?|If you guys die...
{19417}{19509}...and the crazy plate lady dies...
{19531}{19610}...then do I get the baby?|- No, if crazy plate lady...
{19676}{19768}If Monica dies,|then I would get Emma. Right?
{19851}{19918}- Well, actually...|- Actually what?
{19923}{20004}It's just...|It's just that in that case...
{20008}{20054}...then Emma would go|to my parents.
{20066}{20117}- What?|- Hurts, doesn't it?
{20202}{20279}Who has to die for me to get her?
{20434}{20513}So if Monica's not around,|I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
{20518}{20576}No, that is not what we're saying.
{20581}{20622}Yeah, he's lying. He looked down.
{20683}{20734}Well, what's wrong with me?|Am I incompetent?
{20739}{20825}Because I managed to survive whatever|it is that killed the three of you!
{20891}{21012}You're taking this the wrong way.|We think you'll be a wonderful parent.
{21016}{21104}It's just... You're more|the, you know, fun parent.
{21108}{21209}Yeah, and we wanna make sure|Emma also has someone like Monica...
{21213}{21258}...who's more of a disciplinarian.
{21262}{21331}Someone who can be firm and strict.
{21335}{21397}That's not how you see me, is it?
{21423}{21484}No, you're all about the fun.
{21632}{21720}I may not know a lot about babies,|but do you really think I'm not capable?
{21725}{21790}No. You both are equally capable.
{21794}{21856}It's just you're strongest|when you're together.
{21861}{21953}Okay. So if we both had Emma,|and I died...
{21969}{22010}...she'd have to give her up.
{22025}{22089}Sure. Monica would have to give her up.
{22103}{22173}I lie better than that, right?
{22206}{22301}Let me just get this straight.|So my two friends die, I get Emma.
{22305}{22403}Then my wife dies. Then Emma,|the one tiny ray of hope left in my life...
{22407}{22491}...gets taken away from me?|- There's your movie.
{22579}{22644}Hey, there you are.
{22648}{22725}- You disappeared after dinner.|- Did somebody miss me?
{22730}{22800}Was there a child to raise poorly?
{22813}{22866}Ross and Rachel don't know|what they're saying.
{22871}{22916}It's not like they're so responsible.
{22920}{23027}Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot|and a five-year-old condom.
{23071}{23167}No, but they're right. I'm not a strong|father figure, and I never will be.
{23172}{23235}No, you learn these things.|You grow into it.
{23241}{23283}Yeah, but it's not who I am.
{23288}{23411}Everything they said is exactly why I was|worried about having a kid. And it's true.
{23415}{23486}- And look, everybody knows it.|- I don't know it.
{23490}{23576}I wanna have a kid with you because|I think you'll be an amazing dad.
{23580}{23643}At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
{23648}{23732}Well, can you picture me saying,|"Go to your room, you're grounded"?
{23752}{23809}Can you hear me say,|"You're grounded"?
{23813}{23872}You said that to me last week.
{23916}{24000}How hard is it?|"No shoes on the furniture!"
{24157}{24256}The producer from "Days" left a message|asking why I wasn't at the parade.
{24261}{24361}They said everybody's really pissed off|at me. And they all got to meet Santa!
{24401}{24459}It's okay.|I thought of the perfect lie for you.
{24464}{24547}It's easy to remember,|and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.
{24552}{24644}You weren't at the parade|because you had a family emergency.
{24649}{24710}I like that! Yeah!
{24714}{24783}I wasn't at the parade|because I had a family emergency.
{24788}{24835}What happened?
{24839}{24913}- My sister's raccoon came...|- No, nothing with a raccoon!
{24988}{25056}- Wait, what are you doing?|- Setting the table.
{25060}{25152}We thought it might be nice|to use the fancy china for dessert too.
{25157}{25243}How nice. Maybe later we can all|blow our noses on my wedding dress.
{25417}{25473}Hey, dude, you okay?|Sorry about before.
{25477}{25578}That's okay. You're totally right. I don't|know anything about disciplining a child.
{25582}{25691}But it did hurt my feelings,|and I want you to know that if I die...
{25695}{25749}...you don't get Joey.
{26079}{26152}In case you hadn't noticed,|I'm not talking to you.
{26203}{26269}You know, this is just...|This is classic Rachel.
{26274}{26381}Right. Remember in high school when|I died and didn't give you my baby?
{26443}{26513}This might be my one chance|to have a child, Rachel.
{26518}{26598}I mean, you know that I have been|so busy focusing on my career...
{26602}{26693}- What career?|- I'm a decorator.
{26698}{26779}You decorate Dad's office|and now you're a decorator?
{26783}{26895}Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday,|now I'm a koala bear.
{26963}{27054}- Why can't you ever be supportive?|- You want to talk supportive?
{27058}{27149}You didn't come and visit me when|I was in the hospital having the baby!
{27153}{27249}You didn't come see me in the hospital|when I was getting my lips done!
{27285}{27337}I did the first time.
{27389}{27472}You know what? You want to know|why I am not giving Emily to you?
{27476}{27534}- Emma.|- Whose side are you on?!
{27567}{27676}I'm not giving you Emma because you|can't handle the responsibility of a child.
{27688}{27769}Well, how hard could it be?|You do it.
{27874}{27953}You wanna know why|you don't want me to have the baby?
{27957}{28011}Because you don't want me to be happy.
{28015}{28102}- You have always been jealous of me.|- Jealous of what?
{28106}{28195}Of your lack of responsibility?|Your immaturity?
{28199}{28271}Your total disregard|for other people's feelings?
{28276}{28332}To name a few.
{28377}{28416}You've always been like this.
{28420}{28502}You had to have everything,|and I couldn't have anything.
{28506}{28583}Like in junior high,|when you stole Timmy from me.
{28587}{28656}I mean, do you even realize|how much that hurt me?
{28661}{28720}Timmy was my boyfriend,|and you made out with him!
{28725}{28799}Come on, that was 20 years ago.|Get over it.
{28806}{28877}I cannot believe|that I invited you here today!
{28881}{28975}Yeah, well, you know what I cannot|believe? That my so-called sister...
{28979}{29095}...gets a 30%"%" discount from Ralph|Lauren, and I still have to pay retail?
{29153}{29190}It's 45.
{29223}{29267}You bitch.
{29328}{29375}You just think you're so perfect...
{29379}{29468}...with your new baby|and your small apartment.
{29503}{29627}Well, let me tell you something.|Your baby isn't even that cute.
{29660}{29749}Too far, Amy. Too far.
{29802}{29851}- You take that back.|- No.
{29856}{29914}- Take it back!|- No. What are you gonna do? Make me?
{29919}{29989}Hey, man, I work out!
{30027}{30073}- So do I.|- I do Pilates.
{30078}{30119}- I do yoga.|- Bring it on!
{30132}{30201}Put the plates in the boxes!|Put the plates in the boxes!
{30260}{30318}- Did you just push me?|- Yeah, I think I did.
{30323}{30354}All right, that's it.
{30359}{30426}Forget the bubble wrap!|There isn't time!
{30480}{30523}Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!
{30638}{30702}- Shouldn't we stop this?|- Are you out of your mind?
{30706}{30763}Let's throw some Jell-O on them!
{30874}{30914}Gross!
{31193}{31313}All right, that is it! This is our apartment,|and you cannot behave this way!
{31317}{31383}If you can't act your age,|you shouldn't be here at all.
{31388}{31505}Those plates may not be as nice as|the pretty pink ones that I picked out...
{31526}{31648}...but they're important to Monica.|And I want you to apologize to her, now.
{31654}{31715}- I'm sorry.|- Mon, I'm so sorry.
{31719}{31765}Okay. That's better.
{31769}{31850}Now, I want you to apologize|to each other and mean it.
{31864}{31898}- Sorry.|- Sorry.
{31903}{31983}By the way, that fight|was totally arousing.
{32084}{32130}Dude, well done.
{32135}{32256}If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,|you can totally take care of Emma.
{32273}{32316}Yeah? Well, thanks.
{32328}{32403}So...|So now do I get Joey?
{32448}{32564}Okay. But you should know he eats a lot|and shoves pennies up his nose.
{32687}{32739}Are you okay, Mon?
{32743}{32832}I mean, these things happen.|I mean, it's just a plate.
{32836}{32926}- It's not like somebody died.|- It's all right. You can mourn.
{32935}{33030}Thank you. It was so beautiful!
{33081}{33135}I'm gonna go to Joey's|and get the pies.
{33140}{33230}Actually, not pies. It's just pie.
{33263}{33316}I don't care.
{33320}{33406}Oh, my God, I've lost the will to scold.
{33503}{33554}Look, Amy...
{33565}{33603}...we got a little...
{33607}{33675}...a little out-of-control over there.
{33692}{33727}And I'm sorry.
{33731}{33793}You're my sister...
{33797}{33855}...and if it really means|that much to you...
{33863}{33934}- So you're gonna give me the baby?|- No, I was...
{33938}{34012}I was gonna let you use|my Ralph Lauren discount.
{34045}{34115}You are not gonna regret this.
{34184}{34261}- She needs changing.|- No, no, no. I'll get her.
{34266}{34374}I am super confident, totally responsible|and fourth in line to raise Emma.
{34378}{34483}I'll be right there, Emma! Just let me|get my trusty diaper bag here.
{34616}{34690}Well, what do you know?|I guess I'll be the one who dies first.
{34929}{35017}- Does Monica know about her plates?|- Nope.
{35022}{35058}- Broke them all, huh?|- Yep.
{35063}{35107}- You gonna tell her?|- Nope.
{35157}{35243}Hey. So I'm gonna|put the plates back.
{35247}{35332}I think you're right. We shouldn't|use these plates for a long time.
{35337}{35421}- Like only if the queen comes?|- Maybe not even then.
{35446}{35483}Hey. I did it.
{35488}{35572}I told my producer I had a family|emergency. He totally bought it.
{35576}{35688}- Thanks for teaching me how to lie.|- No problem. Next week, stealing.
{35721}{35792}- Bye, plates.|- You told her you broke all the plates?
{35848}{35916}What?!|Something happened with the plates?
{35955}{36045}Yeah, this raccoon came in...

{526}{613}{y:i}How come you're answering your own|{y:i}phone? Where's your crazy assistant?
{705}{730}What's up, Joe?
{735}{786}What have we always wanted|to do together?
{805}{878}Braid each other's hair|and ride horseback on the beach?
{882}{940}No. No. No. When you get home|tomorrow night...
{944}{1025}...you and I are gonna be|at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside!
{1030}{1065}- Courtside? Oh, my God!|{y:i}- Yeah!
{1070}{1161}Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for|the ball and break my jaw with his knee!
{1167}{1221}That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.
{1310}{1345}- Hello?|- Joey just called.
{1349}{1422}He's got courtside Knicks tickets|for him and me tomorrow night.
{1427}{1508}But tomorrow night's the only night|I get off from the restaurant.
{1512}{1574}If you go, we won't have|a night together for a week.
{1578}{1680}But honey, it's courtside!|The cheerleaders will be right in...
{1695}{1753}That's not the way to convince you.
{1757}{1809}I don't wanna be one|of those wives that says:
{1813}{1883}"You can't go to the game.|You have to spend time with me."
{1887}{1944}So if you could just realize|it on your own...
{1970}{2045}I know. You're right.|I wanna see you too.
{2049}{2125}I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.|He's looking forward to it.
{2129}{2189}{y:i}Tell him you haven 't seen|{y:i}your wife in a long time.
{2194}{2286}Tell him that having a long-distance|relationship is really difficult.
{2290}{2389}Tell him that what little time|we have together is precious.

{3565}{3627}You look...
{3654}{3755}I mean, it's just...|That dress...
{3765}{3830}Well, I hope the ends|of these sentences are good.
{3834}{3911}They're good. It's just been a while|since I've seen you like this.
{3915}{3963}You clean up good.
{3981}{4041}Really? Well, thank you.
{4142}{4187}Okay, stop looking at me like that.
{4192}{4261}- Last time that happened, that happened.|- Right, right.
{4395}{4488}So are you excited about|your first night away from Emma?
{4492}{4552}Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I|are gonna have so much fun.
{4556}{4626}- Thank you for watching the baby.|- It's fine.
{4630}{4681}Actually, I invited Mike over.
{4685}{4710}- Phoebe's Mike?|- Yeah.
{4717}{4765}- I didn't know you hung out.|- We don't...
{4770}{4813}...but I'd like to get to know him.
{4817}{4888}Maybe have a little dinner,|drinks, conversation.
{4893}{4958}That's so cute.|Ross and Mike's first date.
{5006}{5069}Will that be awkward?|What are you gonna talk about?
{5074}{5153}I don't know. But you know, we have|a lot in common, you know?
{5157}{5230}He plays piano.|I played keyboards in college.
{5272}{5358}He's been divorced.|I have some experience in that area.
{5410}{5463}- Yeah?|- Hi!
{5532}{5603}Girl's night out indeed.
{5607}{5666}So I think Emma is probably|down for the night...
{5670}{5723}...but if you need anything...|- We'll be fine.
{5727}{5773}- You go have fun.|- Okay, you too.
{5777}{5834}- Thanks.|- And I hope you score.
{5842}{5900}- Okay. Bye.|- Bye.
{5904}{5966}So, welcome.
{5980}{6061}- I got beer.|- I got bottled breast milk.
{6110}{6177}- Why don't we start with the beer.|- Okay.
{6255}{6367}- So Phoebe tells me you play piano.|- Yeah.
{6371}{6438}You know, I used to play keyboards|in college.
{6450}{6483}Do you have one here?
{6522}{6560}No.
{6582}{6635}Okay.
{7042}{7132}You know, I'm divorced.
{7150}{7213}Phoebe... Phoebe says you're...|You've been divorced?
{7217}{7270}Yeah, yeah.
{7275}{7344}Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't really like|to talk about it.
{7425}{7510}That's okay. We'll talk about|something else.
{7722}{7781}- So you're a paleontologist, right?|- Yeah.
{7785}{7833}My cousin's a paleontologist.
{7948}{8045}Well, he and I would probably have|a lot to talk about.
{8174}{8231}- Welcome home.|- Well, look at you.
{8235}{8275}Yeah. What do you think?
{8285}{8333}Well, it looks great. It's just...
{8337}{8416}I'm wearing the same thing|underneath, so...
{8425}{8480}You see what I mean?
{8508}{8591}Hey! How come your door's locked?
{8595}{8642}- Just a second!|- No, no, no!
{8646}{8686}- Joey can't know I'm here.|- Why not?
{8690}{8748}I didn't want to say|I couldn't go to the game...
{8752}{8829}...so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.|- So you lied to him?
{8834}{8925}It's always better to lie than to have|the complicated discussion.
{8965}{9005}Except with you.
{9039}{9125}Hey, open the door! What's going on?
{9212}{9248}- What are you...?|- Hi.
{9252}{9315}Why are you dressed like that?
{9335}{9404}Because Chandler's gonna be home|in a couple of days...
{9408}{9500}...so I thought I would just, you know,|practice the art of seduction.
{9508}{9556}I thought I heard a man's voice before.
{9560}{9626}No, I was just doing Chandler's side|of the conversation.
{9630}{9686}You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"
{9690}{9793}"Really sexy. Could I be any more|turned on?" You know?
{9807}{9848}Okay. Wait a minute.
{9852}{9899}Why are there two glasses|of wine out?
{9912}{9960}Because one of them is for you!
{10068}{10137}Cheers! Okay, bye-bye.
{10177}{10292}You know, it's funny. I've been|practicing the art of seduction myself.
{10360}{10408}- You might wanna keep practicing.|- Yeah.
{10457}{10526}- It's Joey.|- What?
{10530}{10602}- Hey, Joe.|- Dude, come home!
{10640}{10728}- What? Why?|- Come home!
{10733}{10777}Look, I can't. What's going on?
{10782}{10873}I don't know how to tell you this,|but I think Monica's cheating on you!
{10877}{10948}I told you, you shouldn't have married|someone hotter than you!
{11026}{11081}If you can't deal with this,|then I'm gonna.
{11086}{11142}- No!|- I just heard him!
{11175}{11236}Can you hear him now?
{11292}{11345}No. All right, I'm going in.
{11350}{11388}- No, wait!|- I heard him again!
{11472}{11526}All right, just stay there.|I'm coming home.
{11531}{11567}I'll see you when you get here.
{11571}{11625}I'll wait out in the hall|in case he comes out.
{11642}{11713}- Is that really necessary?|- Absolutely. You'd do it for me.
{11717}{11828}Not that you ever have to, because|I know how to keep my women satisfied.
{12107}{12163}Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
{12167}{12302}I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.|Well, how long has it been?
{12330}{12387}Eleven minutes.
{12532}{12592}And now 12.
{12669}{12766}- So you like the beer?|- I do. I do.
{12770}{12860}Although, it's actually a lager.
{12933}{12984}What's the difference|between beer and lager?
{12989}{13050}I don't know.
{13090}{13120}We could look it up.
{13165}{13245}Things are about to get wild.
{13375}{13436}Oh, God, remember the girls' nights|we used to have...
{13440}{13491}...sitting around talking|about you and Ross?
{13495}{13553}Oh, God! It seems like forever ago.
{13557}{13582}I know.
{13615}{13673}So, what's going on|with you and Ross?
{13692}{13813}Well, I don't know. I mean,|for a long time, nothing.
{13817}{13908}But you know, actually,|right before you picked me up...
{13912}{13973}...Ross and I had a little thing.
{13978}{14049}Oh, my God! I love things!|What happened?
{14054}{14133}Well, first he told me|he liked how I looked.
{14137}{14230}And then we had a little...
{14257}{14311}...eye contact.
{14345}{14374}Eye contact?
{14379}{14421}I hope you were using protection.
{14467}{14605}Excuse me, these are from|the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
{14615}{14701}Should we send them something back?|Let's send them mashed potatoes!
{14706}{14738}No, wait! Don't do that!
{14742}{14790}That'll make them think|they can come over.
{14795}{14826}So, what if they do?
{14831}{14961}We're not here to meet guys. You have|a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.
{14980}{15075}Yeah, but nothing has to happen.|We're just having fun.
{15079}{15176}You know, not everything has to go|as far as eye contact.
{15224}{15288}Chandler, you have to tell Joey|you're not in Tulsa.
{15293}{15358}Isn't it better for him|to think you're cheating on me...
{15362}{15430}...than for him to think|I'm cheating on him?
{15435}{15478}I heard it.
{15490}{15549}I don't want him to think|I'm having an affair.
{15567}{15632}All right, I've got a plan.|I'll go down the fire escape...
{15637}{15713}Because all good plans start with,|"I'll go down the fire escape."
{15718}{15751}Hear me out, woman!
{15794}{15844}I'll go down the fire escape and wait.
{15849}{15909}Then it'll be like I just got back|from Tulsa.
{15913}{15985}Joey and I will come in|and see that there's no guy in here.
{15990}{16072}Aren't you afraid that Joey's|gonna figure all this out?
{16150}{16187}I heard it.
{16375}{16424}- I'm gonna wait.|- The scary pigeon's back?
{16429}{16479}It's huge.
{17279}{17372}I can't believe you live in that building.|My grandmother lives in that building!
{17376}{17434}Ida Greene? No sense|of personal space...
{17438}{17498}...kind of smells like chicken,|looks like a potato.
{17503}{17568}- "Spuds" is your grandmother?|- That's my "bubbe"!
{17647}{17718}So we're on our way|to a couple of parties.
{17722}{17801}Maybe we could get your numbers|and call if we find something fun?
{17820}{17898}Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't really|looking for anything to happen...
{17902}{17963}...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.
{17970}{18019}- All right.|- It's no big deal.
{18067}{18175}So she has a boyfriend.|What is your situation?
{18185}{18270}Well, it's complicated.|I don't actually have a boyfriend, but...
{18275}{18335}Then can I have your number?
{18350}{18391}I'm sorry, no.
{18402}{18428}Okay.
{18440}{18495}Oh, sure!
{18529}{18607}Oh, my God, you're giving|your real number!
{18647}{18706}Okay, thanks. I'll give you|a call later tonight.
{18711}{18756}- Great.|- Bye.
{18760}{18790}Bye.
{18837}{18878}So that's great.
{18882}{18971}You, Bill, Ross and Emma are|gonna be so happy together.
{18975}{19009}What were you thinking?
{19014}{19096}I don't know. He was cute,|and he liked me. It was an impulse.
{19100}{19154}But what about Ross?|What about your moment?
{19158}{19207}- Don't you wanna talk to Ross about it?|- No.
{19211}{19286}No, because I know exactly|how the conversation's gonna go.
{19290}{19363}"Hey, Ross, you know, I think|we had a moment before."
{19367}{19446}"Yeah. Me too."
{19450}{19531}"Well, but I'm not sure I really want|to do anything about it."
{19535}{19611}"Yeah. Me neither."
{19615}{19655}"Should we just live together...
{19659}{19711}...and not tell each other|how we're feeling?"
{19715}{19785}"Yeah, that works for me."
{19827}{19873}Yeah, I see what you mean.
{19877}{19956}By the way, nice Ross imitation.
{19960}{19997}Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
{20002}{20037}- Well... Hey!|- Better.
{20100}{20196}The point is maybe I should just stop|waiting around for moments with Ross.
{20200}{20277}You know? I should just move|on with my life.
{20282}{20351}So really, you're moving on from Ross?
{20355}{20411}I don't know.|Do I have to decide right now?
{20415}{20486}You kind of just did.|That guy is gonna call you tonight.
{20490}{20562}Ross will pick up the phone,|and that's a pretty clear message.
{20567}{20608}Oh, my God, Ross!
{20612}{20663}Ross is gonna pick up the phone.
{20667}{20740}I have to get my number back.|Oh, my God, he's gone!
{20745}{20829}"Oh, I have to get my number back!|Oh, my God! He's gone! " Dead on.
{21185}{21266}- You know, I'm gonna take off.|- So soon?
{21270}{21303}- Yeah.|- Okay.
{21307}{21368}Well, thanks... Thanks for the beer.
{21372}{21460}- You mean lager?|- Yeah. Good times.
{21785}{21839}- Hello?|- Hey, Mike, it's me.
{21843}{21889}Listen, is... Is Ross near you?
{21894}{21931}No, I just left.
{21936}{21978}Well, you have to go back in.
{21997}{22108}What? Go back? To the land|where time stands still?
{22125}{22164}I'm so sorry, honey, but...
{22168}{22216}Okay, Rachel gave this guy|her number...
{22220}{22276}...and she doesn't want Ross|to answer the phone.
{22280}{22328}So you have to intercept all his calls.
{22342}{22369}I can't do that!
{22374}{22446}- He says he can't do that.|- Give me the phone.
{22450}{22538}Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, I know that this|is a lot to ask, but you know what?
{22542}{22671}If you do this, Phoebe will do|anything you want.
{22675}{22776}- Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.|- All right. Thank you. Hello?
{22780}{22873}Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actually,|she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
{22922}{22959}All right, I'll do it.
{22982}{23076}But really, how much dirtier|can it get?
{23107}{23165}Oh, Mike.
{23180}{23235}Bye.
{23330}{23373}Hey, buddy.
{23435}{23472}Hi.
{23480}{23548}- Can I come back in?|- Why?
{23582}{23717}Well, I was just thinking about|how much more we have to talk about.
{23730}{23802}But you left.
{23910}{23949}That didn't take long.
{23954}{24040}I thought you said Tulsa was,|like, a three-hour flight?
{24060}{24149}Well, you're forgetting|about the time difference.
{24345}{24395}Yeah.
{24417}{24450}Chandler, you're home!
{24454}{24565}That's right! Your husband's home!|So now the sex can stop!
{24692}{24720}What are you saying?
{24725}{24769}Joey said you're here|with another man!
{24774}{24864}There's no man in here!|How dare you accuse me of that!
{24925}{25060}All right. Then maybe you won't mind|if me and my friend take a look around.
{25140}{25165}What's he doing?
{25170}{25255}I arranged some pillows on the bed|to look like a guy.
{25297}{25410}Bedroom's clear. Although you might|need some new pillows.
{25417}{25490}All right, well, I'll check|the guest room.
{25674}{25727}Why do I smell men's cologne?
{25780}{25832}I think that's you.
{25892}{25990}Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine|on myself earlier.
{26017}{26057}There's nobody here, Joe.
{26076}{26101}I guess not.
{26110}{26216}I can't believe you thought I was|cheating. You owe me an apology.
{26227}{26291}- You're right. I'm so sorry.|- It's an honest mistake.
{26295}{26346}It could happen to anybody. See you.
{26350}{26408}Wait a minute, wait a minute.
{26412}{26512}If you just got back from Tulsa,|how did your suitcase beat you here?
{26600}{26681}I climbed down the fire escape,|and you can't put that in the closet?
{26779}{26846}So, with the exception|of the fermentation process...
{26850}{26932}...beer and ale are|basically the same thing.
{26955}{27018}Fascinating, isn't it?
{27022}{27105}Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
{27135}{27182}I'll get it!
{27304}{27400}Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.
{27445}{27479}It's for you.
{27575}{27653}I don't understand|what just happened here.
{27710}{27751}What's going on?
{27755}{27782}I'm sorry.
{27786}{27885}I told you I was in Tulsa because I|wanted to spend the night with Monica...
{27889}{27981}...and I didn't know...|I didn't think you'd understand.
{28007}{28098}You think I'm too dumb to understand|a husband needs to be with his wife?
{28102}{28177}You think I'm, like...
{28235}{28300}- Joey?|- Yeah.
{28309}{28385}I don't know what to say.|We shouldn't have lied to you.
{28389}{28468}I feel so bad. Is there anything|I can do to make it up to you?
{28527}{28608}You could go to the game with me.|Even though you said you couldn't.
{28612}{28719}But then you lied to me and tricked me|and gave me a bump on the head.
{28725}{28817}I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't|do. I promised I'd be with Monica.
{28832}{28863}All right.
{28881}{28924}- You can go.|- What?
{28928}{28996}You should go to the game.|It's okay. I want you to.
{29007}{29071}- Really? You gonna be okay?|- Yeah, I'll be fine.
{29079}{29167}You know, maybe I'll stay here|and practice the art of seduction.
{29173}{29282}- You're gonna put sweats on and clean.|- It's gonna be so hot!
{29292}{29321}- Bye.|- Bye.
{29325}{29353}Thanks.
{29375}{29409}Here's your ticket.
{29413}{29466}Thanks. Hey, listen...
{29470}{29533}...I'm never gonna lie|to you again, okay?
{29538}{29616}And I want you to know|that nobody thinks you're stupid.
{29632}{29661}Thanks, man.
{29740}{29820}- Where you going?|- Game's tomorrow night, Joe.
{29983}{30017}Oh, God!
{30021}{30090}So glad you're back!
{30117}{30156}So, what did you guys do?
{30161}{30228}You know, we just drank some beer.
{30232}{30297}Mike played with the boundaries|of normal social conduct.
{30327}{30395}It's true, I did.
{30416}{30441}- Well, goodbye.|- Okay.
{30446}{30508}- Bye. That was fun, Pheebs.|- I know. It was fun.
{30512}{30555}See you, guys.
{30559}{30612}Lock the door!|Lock the door, seriously.
{30652}{30716}Shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe|for the drinks.
{30765}{30846}Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.|Did he call? Did that guy call?
{30850}{30886}No, just his mom.
{30891}{30920}Around 8:30?
{30925}{30963}- Yeah.|- Then again at 9:00?
{30975}{31021}Yeah.
{31152}{31202}Hello?
{31210}{31290}No, she's not here right now.|Can I take a message?
{31310}{31380}Bill from the bar?
{31410}{31540}Okay, Bill from the bar,|I'll make sure she gets your number.
{31807}{31863}So... So how was it?
{31867}{31918}Did you guys...?|You guys have a good time?
{31922}{32030}We had so much fun.|It felt so good to be out.
{32097}{32136}Rach?
{32140}{32190}Yeah?
{32257}{32285}Never mind.
{32470}{32533}- Hey, you guys.|- Hey!
{32537}{32622}I'll be right back.|I gotta go to the bathroom.
{32972}{33029}Stout. That's a kind of beer.

{775}{831}I can't believe you won't be here|for Christmas.
{835}{879}You're really not coming back?
{883}{959}We have this paperwork that needs|to be filed by the end of the year.
{964}{1028}- Lf I don't get it done, I'll be fired.|- It's so unfair.
{1032}{1105}- You don't even like your job.|- So. Who does?

{3168}{3244}All right, everybody.|I know it is Christmas Eve...
{3248}{3329}...and you'd rather be with family,|but there is no call for writing...
{3333}{3444}..."Screw you, Mr. Bing"|on the back of my chair.
{3453}{3505}By the way,|you can all call me Chandler.
{3536}{3588}- Hey.|- Hey. Where you been?
{3592}{3672}I was checking out that insurance|company's Christmas party on three.
{3676}{3754}It was really beautiful. They have|decorations and this huge tree.
{3758}{3830}And I just thought,|to hell with them, we have to work.
{3834}{3896}So I stole their ham.
{3928}{3979}Hear that?|You may not be with your families...
{3983}{4046}...but at least it's gonna smell like ham|in here.
{4077}{4126}My kid's in a play right now.
{4148}{4203}You know what?|I know what will cheer you up.
{4207}{4299}I had a talk with the boys in New York.|I told them about all your hard work...
{4303}{4386}...and that a little Christmas bonus|may be in order.
{4391}{4521}"A donation has been made in your name|to the New York City Ballet."
{4580}{4652}Well, that's like money in your pocket.
{4658}{4712}All right, you want me to say it?|This sucks.
{4717}{4774}Being here sucks. This work sucks!
{4779}{4834}Now it feels like Christmas.
{4850}{4890}I'm sorry.
{4894}{4965}At least you get to go home|and be with your families tonight.
{4969}{5030}I have to go to an empty hotel room|and lay down...
{5034}{5117}...on a very questionable bedspread.
{5128}{5199}Then tomorrow, you get to have|Christmas in your own houses.
{5203}{5262}Which, by the way,|none of you have invited me to.
{5267}{5369}- You can come to my house.|- No, thanks.
{5414}{5455}- It was a nice pep talk.|- Thanks.
{5460}{5550}I'm actually thinking about becoming|a motivational speaker.
{5565}{5658}So if you were home right now,|what would you be doing?
{5663}{5766}Typical Christmassy stuff, you know.|Our holidays are pretty traditional.
{5770}{5840}So here's a very special|holiday song...
{5844}{5931}...that I wrote for some|very important people to me.
{7235}{7300}Happy holidays, everybody.
{7314}{7375}Pheebs, look in the kitchen.|I'll look in the back closet.
{7379}{7462}I can save you time, ladies.|I'm right here.
{7474}{7527}Yeah. Chandler,|why don't you take a walk.
{7531}{7578}This doesn't concern you.
{7599}{7660}We are looking for|our Christmas presents from Monica.
{7664}{7745}- What? That's terrible.|- No, no. We do it every year.
{7750}{7809}Well, that makes it not terrible.
{7838}{7944}No. Yeah, we never find them.|She's always bested us, that wily...
{7948}{7980}...minx.
{8001}{8045}We're gonna search here|for an hour...
{8049}{8104}...and then we'll go to Joey's|and search. Okay?
{8108}{8175}No, not okay.|You can't look for Monica's presents.
{8179}{8224}- No, we have to.|- No, you don't have to.
{8228}{8323}And you can't,|because I live here too.
{8329}{8435}- Well, then you should look with us.|- Why?
{8439}{8511}Aren't you worried about what|to get Monica for Christmas?
{8516}{8569}No, I have a great idea|for a present for her.
{8582}{8647}That's it? "A great idea"?
{8667}{8734}That's not enough.|What if she gets you a great present...
{8738}{8789}...two medium presents|and lots of little presents...
{8793}{8871}...and you got her one great present?|That's gonna make her feel bad.
{8875}{8942}Why would you do that to her?|Why? Why?
{8983}{9041}- Lf I helped, we could find them faster!|- Right.
{9103}{9182}- We have a live one!|- It's a Macy's bag!
{9237}{9297}Who's it for?
{9320}{9425}"Dear Losers: Do you really think|I'd hide presents under the couch?
{9462}{9557}P.S. Chandler,|I knew they'd break you."
{9591}{9645}Rach, these are for you.
{9661}{9763}Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
{9768}{9867}No, but with this new-car smell,|you'll think you do.
{9932}{10006}Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
{10077}{10125}Toilet seat covers!
{10200}{10263}Is that what you were doing|while I was getting gas?
{10268}{10327}You guys.
{10331}{10436}And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.
{10498}{10621}- You got me a cola drink?|- And... a lemon-lime!
{10640}{10714}Well, this... This is too much.
{10718}{10787}I feel like I should get you|another sweater.
{10835}{10906}And last but not least...
{10950}{11031}They're ribbed, for your pleasure.
{11047}{11094}Well, hey, Ben?
{11098}{11247}What if the Holiday Armadillo|told you all about the Festival of Lights?
{11252}{11288}Cool!
{11293}{11334}Come on, Ben.
{11398}{11555}Years and years ago, there were|these people called the Maccabees!
{11574}{11651}Merry Christmas!
{11688}{11726}Santa!
{11766}{11841}What are you doing here, Santa?
{11886}{11955}Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.
{11965}{12013}What are you doing here...
{12017}{12108}...weird turtle-man?
{12147}{12307}I'm the Holiday Armadillo,|your part-Jewish friend.
{12339}{12429}You sent me here to give Ben|some presents.
{12433}{12488}Remember?
{12518}{12568}What?
{12578}{12625}Ben, why don't you open|some more presents.
{12630}{12695}Santa, the armadillo and I|will have a talk in the kitchen.
{12706}{12791}There's a sentence I never thought|I'd say.
{12814}{12851}What are you doing?
{12856}{12931}You called and said you had trouble|finding a Santa costume...
{12935}{12998}...so I borrowed one|from a guy at work.
{13003}{13063}Thank you, but you gotta leave.
{13068}{13103}- Why?|- Because...
{13108}{13173}...I'm finally getting him excited|about Hanukkah.
{13177}{13213}And you're wrecking it.
{13218}{13315}But I didn't get to shake my belly|like a bowl full of jelly.
{13390}{13482}I'm sorry, Chandler,|but this is really important to me.
{13492}{13587}Okay, fine. I'll give the suit back.
{13591}{13695}Hey, you think you can keep it|another night?
{13737}{13786}Santa? Really?
{13798}{13926}- Yeah, is that okay?|- Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?
{13950}{14049}- No.|- Then it's okay!
{14101}{14154}You know what, everybody?
{14158}{14211}Go home.|You should be with your families.
{14216}{14269}It's bad enough we're working|New Year's Eve.
{14329}{14410}Did I not tell anyone|about New Year's Eve?
{14414}{14494}All right, look, go. Go home, okay?|Merry Christmas.
{14520}{14573}- Merry Christmas.|- Peace on earth.
{14577}{14690}- Bye.|- Good. Godspeed, good people.
{14707}{14807}- You're not gonna go?|- No. I couldn't leave you alone.
{14811}{14866}Thanks.
{14876}{14967}Besides, I can't leave until that|Christmas party downstairs clears out.
{14971}{15050}There are some pissed-off|insurance people looking for that ham.
{15143}{15199}- Chandler Bing.|- Hi, honey. We're all here.
{15203}{15246}We want to wish you|a merry Christmas.
{15251}{15303}- Merry Christmas!|- Merry Christmas!
{15369}{15419}Merry Christmas. I miss you guys.
{15424}{15486}So is it horrible?|Is everybody working really hard?
{15492}{15559}Well, no, it's just me and Wendy.
{15565}{15629}Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.
{15650}{15710}It is. Did I not tell you about her?
{15738}{15805}About the time you told me|about New Year's Eve.
{15810}{15884}- Where's everybody else?|- "I sent them home."
{15888}{15979}You are such a good boss.|Is she pretty?
{16044}{16097}Answer faster. Answer faster.
{16102}{16170}- I don't know.|- Answer better. Answer better.
{16196}{16269}I don't think of her that way.|I mean, she's a colleague.
{16274}{16347}- What does she do there?|- She's regional vice president.
{16351}{16411}- She's just below me.|- She did what?
{16508}{16589}Below me.
{16622}{16679}Wait, is Wendy the runner-up|Miss Oklahoma?
{16683}{16723}What?!
{16755}{16807}Well, she didn't win.
{16840}{16883}All right, maybe I should let you...
{16888}{16959}...and the second prettiest girl|in Oklahoma get back to work.
{16964}{17060}Second prettiest that year. Of all|the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
{17065}{17100}Chandler, stop talking.
{17150}{17213}Honey, there's really|nothing to worry about.
{17218}{17272}- Okay.|- I'm serious.
{17277}{17307}Okay.
{17314}{17379}- Merry Christmas.|- Merry Christmas.
{17383}{17477}- Merry Christmas, you guys.|- Merry Christmas.
{17608}{17692}- The wife says hi.|- Fun conversation?
{17697}{17770}Well, she's just got|this weird idea that...
{17774}{17853}...because you and I are alone|something's gonna happen.
{17857}{17906}Really?
{17927}{17991}Would that be so terrible?
{18038}{18112}This is probably the wrong thing|to be worrying about...
{18116}{18208}...but you're getting ham|on my only tie.
{18365}{18442}- Back off, missy!|- Missy?
{18447}{18510}I don't know. I'm not used to girls|making passes at me.
{18514}{18611}Wait a minute.|Am I sexy in Oklahoma?
{18634}{18744}- You are to me.|- No. No. No!
{18768}{18854}- Look, I'm married.|- So? I'm married.
{18859}{18904}I'm happily married.
{18942}{18971}What's that like?
{18998}{19099}- Right. So I'm sorry, but...|- Seriously? Happily married?
{19103}{19178}So that phone call before,|that was happy?
{19183}{19260}Well, look, it's not easy|to spend this much time apart.
{19265}{19318}She's entitled to be|a little paranoid.
{19322}{19386}Or, in this case, right on the money.
{19413}{19520}You know, she's amazing|and beautiful and smart.
{19524}{19611}And if she were here right now,|she'd kick your ass.
{19673}{19803}Look, you're a really nice person,|ham-stealing and adultery aside.
{19848}{19915}But what I have with my wife|is pretty great.
{19919}{19992}So nothing's ever gonna happen|between us.
{20005}{20059}Okay, let me ask you something.
{20063}{20149}If what you and your wife have|is so great...
{20153}{20231}...then why are you spending|Christmas with me?
{20265}{20327}You were the most beautiful woman|in the room tonight.
{20356}{20389}- Really?|- Are you kidding?
{20393}{20465}You're the most beautiful woman|in most rooms.
{20660}{20715}What's going on?|You and I just made out.
{20719}{20778}- You and I are making out?|- Well, not anymore.
{20796}{20888}- But we don't do that.|- I know. I just thought it would be fun.
{20915}{20988}- How drunk are you?|- Drunk enough that I wanna do this.
{20992}{21070}Not so drunk that you should|feel guilty about taking advantage.
{21112}{21161}That's a perfect amount.
{21313}{21356}- You know what's weird?|- What?
{21361}{21418}- This doesn't feel weird.|- I know.
{21422}{21547}- You're a really good kisser.|- Well, I have kissed over four women.
{21581}{21668}You wanna get under the covers?|Okay.
{21876}{21915}Wow, you are really fast.
{21920}{21996}It bodes well for me|that speed impresses you.
{22029}{22103}- We're gonna see each other naked.|- Yep.
{22107}{22171}- You want to do it at the same time?|- Count of three?
{22175}{22211}- One.|- Two.
{22215}{22265}Three.
{22358}{22455}Well, I think it's safe to say|that our friendship is effectively ruined.
{22460}{22523}We weren't that close anyway.
{22570}{22628}Are you really gonna go out|with that nurse-man?
{22661}{22710}Well, you and I|are just goofing around.
{22714}{22801}I thought, why not|just goof around with him?
{22851}{22953}I don't know if you've ever looked up|"goofing around" in the dictionary.
{22957}{23012}Well, I have.
{23017}{23136}And the technical definition|is two friends...
{23140}{23291}...who care a lot about each other|and have amazing sex...
{23350}{23453}...and just want to spend|more time together.
{23457}{23533}If you have this newfangled dictionary|that gets you mad at me...
{23537}{23626}...then we have to, you know,|get you my original dictionary.
{23693}{23735}I am so bad at this.
{23757}{23812}I think you're better|than you think you are.
{23817}{23908}- Really? Okay. So if...?|- Know when to stop.
{23913}{23962}I sensed that I should stop.
{23987}{24040}- So we're okay?|- Yeah.
{24123}{24188}- Don't do the dance.|- Right.
{24227}{24288}I can't get married without|something old, something new...
{24292}{24354}...something borrowed, something blue.|- Okay, okay.
{24359}{24414}Here's something blue and new.
{24419}{24479}You are so efficient. I love you.
{24487}{24516}- Let's go.|- No, no, wait!
{24520}{24561}We need something old.
{24566}{24667}Okay. I have a condom in my wallet|that I've had since I was 12.
{24700}{24740}That'll work!
{24744}{24788}I don't think so.
{24806}{24852}Okay. Now we just need|something borrowed.
{24892}{24983}- Here, just take this.|- That's stealing.
{24988}{25049}We'll bring it back.|Just put it under your dress.
{25325}{25376}Okay, one thing at a time.
{25426}{25475}Listen...
{25506}{25541}...I've been thinking.
{25576}{25667}It's not fair for me to ask you to spend|all of your money on our wedding.
{25671}{25745}I mean, you work...|You work really hard for that.
{25750}{25803}- Well...|- Well, you work for that.
{25849}{25914}Look, I've thought about it too.|And...
{25918}{26029}...I'm sorry. I think we should spend|all of the money on the wedding.
{26051}{26147}- You do?|- Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.
{26188}{26239}Yeah, look, when I proposed...
{26243}{26342}...I told you that I would do anything|to make you happy.
{26346}{26434}And if having the perfect wedding|makes you happy, then...
{26438}{26485}Then that's what we're gonna do.
{26499}{26570}You are so sweet.
{26616}{26721}But wait. What about our...?|What about the future and stuff?
{26726}{26816}Forget about the future and stuff.|So we only have two kids.
{26820}{26920}You know, we'll pick our favorite,|and that one will get to go to college.
{26949}{27003}- You've thought about that?|- Yeah.
{27007}{27104}- How many kids were we gonna have?|- Four. A boy, twin girls...
{27108}{27167}...and another boy.
{27185}{27234}- What else did you think about?|- Well...
{27251}{27344}...stuff like where we'd live, you know.
{27349}{27456}Like a small place outside the city|where our kids could ride bikes and stuff.
{27460}{27548}And we could have a cat|that had a bell on its collar...
{27552}{27645}...and we could hear it every time|it ran through the little kitty door.
{27649}{27752}We'd have an apartment over the garage|where Joey could grow old.
{27879}{27931}You know what?
{27936}{28006}I don't...|I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
{28018}{28070}- Sure you do.|- No.
{28101}{28166}I want everything|that you've just said.
{28170}{28229}I want a marriage.
{28241}{28295}You sure?
{28339}{28438}- I love you so much.|- I love you.
{28780}{28879}- I love it!|- Really? You're not gonna return it?
{28884}{28919}Well, not this second.
{28987}{29045}Hey, look, you guys. It's snowing!
{29121}{29253}- Wow, it's so beautiful.|- Wow, it really is.
{29308}{29382}Wendy's a fat-girl name.
{29386}{29446}Aren't we done with that?
{29450}{29548}Okay, fine. Fine.|Let's talk about snow.
{29574}{29687}Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa where|my husband's having sex on a copier?
{29746}{29807}- Hey.|- Oh, my God.
{29878}{29940}Look at that.|That's a Christmas miracle!
{29990}{30086}- What are you doing here?|- I wanted to be with you.
{30090}{30132}I missed you so much.
{30136}{30215}- Hey, hey. Who'd you miss the most?|- Monica.
{30240}{30289}Gotcha.
{30350}{30457}- I never want to leave you again.|- I thought if you left, you'd get fired.
{30462}{30545}Turns out they can't fire me.|Because I quit.
{30554}{30639}- What?|- What? You...? You really quit your job?
{30644}{30727}Yeah. It was a stupid job,|and I could not stand leaving you.
{30734}{30823}Why should I be the only one who|doesn't do what he really wants to do?
{30828}{30946}- Well, what do you really wanna do?|- I have not thought this through.
{30962}{31046}- Oh, my God.|- I know. I should've talked to you first.
{31051}{31127}No, I think that this is what|you wanna do. I think it's great!
{31149}{31194}Thanks.
{31199}{31321}Chandler, your being here is the best|Christmas present I could ever imagine.
{31358}{31418}- Now give me my real gift.|- Yeah.
{31422}{31471}- Thank you.|- Here, pass those around.
{31672}{31775}"A donation has been made in your name|to the New York City Ballet."
{31817}{31873}How did you know?
{31877}{31973}What? Are you kidding?|I can't return this.
{32001}{32054}It's time we started thinking about|other people.
{32058}{32121}And besides, this gift still says,|"I love you guys."
{32126}{32217}- Mine says, "To Lillian Myers."|- I don't have a job.
{32342}{32404}Actuary? No.
{32412}{32488}Bookkeeper? No.
{32492}{32554}Topless dancer?
{32684}{32769}Hey, you know what I just realized?|You are the sole wage earner.
{32773}{32905}You are the head of the household.|I don't do anything. I'm a kept man!
{32910}{32946}You are.
{32950}{32984}Honey, here's 20 bucks.
{32991}{33054}Go buy yourself something pretty|while I'm at work tomorrow.

{685}{752}You can be whatever you want|to be now. It's exciting.

{2329}{2354}Thank you.
{2359}{2437}Joey, could I have a sip of your coffee|and a bite of your muffin?
{2441}{2501}- Okay.|- Thank you.
{2663}{2702}Thank you.
{2755}{2827}Pheebs, have you ever been bitten|by a hungry Italian?
{2855}{2921}I'm sorry.|It's just, I'm a little short on cash.
{2927}{2978}If you want,|I could loan you some money.
{2983}{3056}Oh, no. I learned never to|borrow money from friends.
{3061}{3162}That's why Richard Dreyfuss|and I don't speak anymore.
{3175}{3258}Hey, how about this?|Wanna be an extra on my show?
{3263}{3296}You could do that?
{3301}{3381}The pay's pretty good, and you|could do it for as long as you need.
{3385}{3468}- Oh, my God. I'm gonna be on TV!|- Okay, now...
{3473}{3563}I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't|as glamorous and exciting as you think.
{3567}{3657}- Really?|- No, it is awesome.
{3671}{3703}Hey, guys.
{3765}{3802}Why are you all dressed up?
{3807}{3911}We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren|today to introduce her to everyone.
{3915}{3968}- Doesn't she look cute?|- She sure does.
{3973}{4033}Why does she have a pink bow|taped to her head?
{4037}{4108}Because if one more person says,|"What a cute little boy"...
{4113}{4175}...I'm gonna whip them|with a car antenna.
{4181}{4242}I think she's gonna be|the hit of the office.
{4247}{4349}Yeah, she's gonna be hotter|than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.
{4395}{4435}Can I get a blue bow?
{4513}{4578}Okay. I have looked through|a bunch of career guides...
{4583}{4641}...photocopied and highlighted|key passages...
{4645}{4769}...and put them into alphabetical folders,|so you can make an informed decision.
{4773}{4825}How long was I in there?
{4845}{4916}Okay, let's start with the A's.|Advertising.
{4931}{5014}Wait. Advertising, that's a great idea.
{5053}{5102}Don't you wanna look through the rest?
{5129}{5219}I don't think I have to hear the rest.|Advertising makes perfect sense.
{5223}{5271}Sorry you had to waste all this time.
{5275}{5376}You call eight hours alone|with my label maker wasted time?
{5381}{5429}Now I'll get to use my shredder!
{5445}{5541}I mean, I could write slogans.|How hard could it be, right?
{5549}{5665}"Cheese. It's milk that you chew."
{5737}{5856}"Crackers. Because your cheese|needs a buddy."
{5861}{5975}"A grape. Because who can get|a watermelon in your mouth?"
{6003}{6027}I got one.
{6031}{6128}"Socks. Because your family's feet|deserve the best."
{6133}{6169}Honey, leave it to the pros.
{6205}{6252}I actually know someone in advertising.
{6257}{6327}I grew up with a guy who is|a vice president at a big agency.
{6337}{6397}Maybe I can get him to meet you.|Give me the phone.
{6401}{6524}"The phone. Bringing you closer|to people who have phones."
{6557}{6615}"Marriage. It's not for everybody."
{6719}{6804}That went well. Almost everybody|knew that she was a girl.
{6809}{6893}Yeah, after you punched that one guy|who got it wrong, word spread.
{6915}{6989}I'm just gonna go in my office|and pick up some stuff.
{7075}{7136}- Who the hell are you?|- Who the hell are you?
{7141}{7221}I'm the hell person|whose office this is.
{7225}{7278}Good one, Rach.
{7289}{7367}I'm Gavin Mitchell,|the person who's taking over your job.
{7371}{7400}Excuse me?
{7425}{7496}Your baby's so cute.
{7503}{7573}But why would you put|a pink bow on a boy?
{7695}{7748}Hey, Joey. Look at me.
{7753}{7788}I'm a nurse.
{7793}{7819}Yes, you are.
{7825}{7896}I think it might be time|for my sponge bath.
{7901}{7976}Sorry, I'm just so used|to hitting on the extras.
{7981}{8064}- So are you excited about your scene?|- Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.
{8069}{8157}Relax. Don't be. They'll probably|just make you stand in the background.
{8163}{8239}- Good.|- You. Here, come here. Here.
{8243}{8326}Take this tray, stand on this yellow mark.|You're gonna move on "action."
{8331}{8421}Walk over to the operating table, stop on|the blue mark and put the tray down.
{8425}{8464}Don't walk too fast.
{8479}{8540}But don't dawdle.
{8547}{8596}Okay. Now, what?
{8619}{8699}And, action!
{8833}{8857}Cut! Cut.
{8861}{8945}- I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.|- Well, don't be.
{8961}{9017}Okay, that helps.
{9037}{9099}And, action!
{9197}{9223}Cut!
{9229}{9319}Don't worry about it, Pheebs.|It usually takes me three takes too.
{9323}{9353}All right, eight.
{9387}{9517}And, action!
{9937}{10020}So do you have any other|questions about advertising?
{10025}{10090}No. But let me show you what I can do.
{10105}{10163}"Bagels and doughnuts.
{10167}{10263}Round food for every mood."
{10293}{10352}Monica warned me you might do that.
{10399}{10466}I think we might have something|for you at the agency.
{10471}{10567}- Really? That's great.|- It's an unpaid internship.
{10603}{10702}That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"|it sounded like you said "unpaid."
{10713}{10813}Come on, now. Monica has a good job.|It's not like you have a family to support.
{10817}{10908}Actually, we're trying. I don't think|Monica is gonna want to postpone it.
{10913}{10984}We're supposed to have sex tonight.
{11001}{11077}Actually, she's probably at home,|naked right now.
{11117}{11193}I tend to keep talking|till somebody stops me.
{11243}{11329}- I can just picture her on the bed.|- Stop!
{11367}{11426}Wait. What do you mean|you're taking over my job?
{11431}{11511}While you were on your baby vacation,|I was doing your job.
{11515}{11591}A vacation? My idea|of a vacation does not involve...
{11595}{11698}...something sucking on my nipples|until they are raw.
{11711}{11807}Clearly, you've never been|to Sandals Paradise Island.
{11875}{11966}All right. Don't get too comfortable|there, because I'm back in two weeks.
{11971}{12010}I want everything back|the way it was.
{12015}{12096}I can't say I care too much for the way|you've rearranged my office.
{12101}{12169}I can't say I care too much|for that smell you've brought in.
{12177}{12302}- Excuse me?|- Rach, we have a code brown situation.
{12327}{12390}Honey, could you please|take care of it for me?
{12405}{12512}All right, but you're gonna|have to do one sometime.
{12541}{12582}Let me just get this straight.
{12587}{12667}So I go have a baby, and they send|some guy in to do my job?
{12671}{12769}Well, there was talk of shutting down|Ralph Lauren altogether.
{12773}{12826}Okay. Right.|You're very cheeky for a temp.
{12831}{12915}I'm not a temp. I was transferred here|from another department.
{12919}{12988}And what department was that?|The jerk department?
{12993}{13038}They didn't tell me|about your quick wit.
{13043}{13127}Well, did they mention that|I'm rubber and you're glue?
{13145}{13239}- Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.|- Hi, Mr. Zelner.
{13243}{13288}Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.
{13293}{13365}When you left us, we weren't sure|what we were gonna do.
{13369}{13462}But then, Gavin to the rescue.|Super Gavin.
{13493}{13528}Well, that's great.
{13533}{13606}So now, Super Gavin,|when I come back...
{13611}{13686}...where do you plan on flying off to?
{13691}{13782}That's up to Mr. Zelner.|I'm sure he'll make the right decision.
{13793}{13860}Super ass-kissing power.
{13875}{13931}Incidentally, when are you coming back?
{13967}{13993}Today.
{13999}{14096}- You said two weeks.|- No, I said today.
{14101}{14195}See, for a superhero,|not so much with the listening.
{14301}{14349}So, what'd he say?
{14363}{14419}He can be a little rough|around the edges...
{14423}{14537}...so I'm gonna replace a word|he used a lot with the word "puppy."
{14571}{14696}So he said, "If your puppy friend|doesn't get her puppy act together...
{14701}{14773}...I am gonna fire|her mother-puppy ass."
{14795}{14866}I'm sorry. I can't do this.|I'm just not an actor.
{14871}{14928}That's right. You're not.|You're a nurse.
{14933}{14992}- You're Nurse With Tray.|- No, Joey...
{14997}{15071}Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.|She has no time for friends.
{15075}{15163}She gets in that operating room|and she carries that tray to the doctor...
{15167}{15214}...because if she doesn't, people die.
{15219}{15261}Who dies?
{15265}{15308}Man With Eye Patch!
{15313}{15370}Now, you get in there,|and you do your job.
{15377}{15424}Yes, doctor.
{15443}{15516}Okay, let's try this one more time.
{15521}{15625}Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.|Your tray is coming.
{15657}{15737}And, action.
{15857}{15911}Yes, I did it! I nailed it!
{15943}{15970}What's next?
{15977}{16033}The rest of the scene.
{16077}{16120}Okay, from the top, people.
{16285}{16365}Listen, sudden change of plans.|My maternity leave just ended.
{16369}{16434}They said if I didn't|come back today, they'd fire me.
{16439}{16483}What? No, that's illegal.
{16487}{16552}I'll have the Labor Department|here so fast, they won't...
{16557}{16693}All right, calm down, Norma Rae.|They didn't actually say that.
{16697}{16803}I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,|this guy will try and squeeze me out.
{16807}{16880}But what about Emma?|I mean, we don't have a nanny.
{16885}{16958}I know. We're just gonna have|to figure out a plan tonight.
{16963}{17020}Can you please just take care|of her for today?
{17031}{17116}Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,|and we'll be on our way.
{17155}{17233}Come on.|I don't know what else to do.
{17239}{17301}Fine. Fine.
{17305}{17394}We'll have fun, won't we?|Yes, we will. Yes, we...
{17519}{17554}Ross.
{17607}{17644}You're pretty.
{17795}{17884}Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be|starting a new career from scratch.
{17893}{17959}It's gonna be a while|before I make a living at it.
{17971}{18071}Maybe now's not the right time|to be starting a family.
{18075}{18186}So you have to tell Monica you don't|want to have a baby right now?
{18191}{18215}Yeah.
{18263}{18303}Goodbye.
{18391}{18474}Okay, it's baby time.|Pants off, Bing.
{18525}{18566}Didn't see you there, Geller.
{18615}{18661}Ross is here, so...
{18739}{18812}And I was really hoping|that maybe I could hang out.
{18847}{18914}You know, what do you feel like doing?
{18941}{18998}Well, we're gonna have sex.
{19015}{19078}I don't feel like having sex.
{19153}{19239}Maybe... I don't know. Maybe we|can watch a movie or something.
{19245}{19279}Let me put it this way:
{19283}{19344}We're having sex|whether you're here or not.
{19363}{19405}Pants off, Bing.
{19507}{19618}Now that I'm back, why don't you just|fill me in on what you've been up to.
{19625}{19718}Well, I've changed your screen saver|from that picture of *NS YNC.
{19723}{19765}Hey, they were popular when I left.
{19795}{19856}I'm working on this|big presentation for tomorrow.
{19863}{19922}I should be involved in that,|so get me up to speed.
{19927}{19995}That'll take weeks.|Let me take care of the presentation.
{19999}{20053}No. I see what you're|doing here, all right?
{20057}{20163}This is my job, buddy. I've had it for|five years, and I know how it works.
{20169}{20266}- So why don't you just catch me up.|- Fine.
{20271}{20352}Oh, God. You've totally messed|with the back support on my chair.
{20357}{20412}- How do you fix this?|- You've been here five years.
{20417}{20507}- You figure it out.|- Fine, I will.
{20663}{20698}All right, fill me in.
{20871}{20958}Do you have a blue tie that would go|with this? Emma spit up on mine.
{20963}{21028}Yeah, but you have to give it back|if I get a job.
{21033}{21097}Of course, by that time,|ties will be obsolete...
{21101}{21177}...and we'll all be wearing|silver jumpsuits.
{21207}{21251}Hey, good morning, lover.
{21255}{21342}I gotta say, after last night,|I'm a little weak in the knees.
{21417}{21530}Here's an idea. You walk into a room,|take a quick scan.
{21593}{21618}Sorry.
{21623}{21737}But I kind of have this feeling that|we may have made a baby last night.
{21741}{21838}Oh, God, I have to tell you something.
{21851}{21885}You're not pregnant.
{21895}{21926}What are you talking about?
{21935}{22016}Well, that thing that I have to do|to make a baby?
{22021}{22048}I faked it.
{22067}{22123}What? You faked it?
{22147}{22201}You know what?
{22239}{22292}I don't need a tie.
{22323}{22436}I mean, it's better open collar,|you know?
{22469}{22532}It's more casual.
{22655}{22731}Joey. Listen, I can't do this.|It doesn't make any sense.
{22735}{22826}Yesterday I was a nurse,|and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
{22831}{22914}Sometimes we use the same extras|for different parts. It's okay.
{22919}{23031}Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very|memorable performance as the nurse.
{23035}{23142}And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress?|That's gonna confuse my fans.
{23205}{23286}Well, maybe you are a nurse...
{23291}{23372}...but you moonlight as a waitress.
{23481}{23562}Because I'm a single mother|supporting my two children.
{23575}{23610}Nice.
{23651}{23681}Wait a minute.
{23687}{23794}Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the|same hospital. Wouldn't I come say hi?
{23799}{23897}No. No, see, you and Drake|are having a fight.
{23903}{23940}About what?
{23945}{24016}He slept with you|and then never called you.
{24047}{24145}And I just wanted a new daddy|for Davey and Becky.
{24183}{24232}Okay. Okay, from the top.
{24243}{24313}And, action.
{24319}{24395}So I'm surprised you agreed|to have lunch with me.
{24401}{24459}I'm surprised too. But yet, here I am.
{24493}{24553}Cut! Cut!
{24557}{24592}What are you doing?
{24597}{24697}I'm very angry at him because he slept|with me and never called me back.
{24703}{24750}- Me too.|- Me too!
{24781}{24835}Calm down. She means on the show.
{24839}{24902}We need some new extras|around here.
{24989}{25028}Wow. You're here already.
{25033}{25138}Yes. Emma and I came in a little early|to do research on the presentation.
{25143}{25228}Actually, I made a few changes.|I think I'm caught up on everything.
{25233}{25276}So ask me anything.
{25283}{25354}- How do you fix the chair?|- Except that!
{25379}{25487}Hello, Mr. Zelner. We are all ready|for our presentation this afternoon.
{25493}{25608}- Good, because it's in 10 minutes.|- What? I can't do that. I have the baby.
{25613}{25664}Ross is not gonna pick her up|for an hour.
{25669}{25736}Then Gavin can give the presentation.|We have to do it now.
{25741}{25827}Ralph needs to leave early today.|He's going helicopter shopping.
{25903}{25958}Well, there you go, you win.|You win.
{25963}{26033}You get to do the presentation.|You'll knock them dead.
{26037}{26128}No one will remember that I worked here,|and then Ralph will buy his helicopter...
{26133}{26217}...and Super Gavin will just fly|right alongside of him.
{26333}{26411}- You can do the presentation.|- No, I can't. I have a baby.
{26423}{26465}I'll watch her.
{26517}{26546}Why would you do that?
{26555}{26667}Because you worked really hard, and|it's your job. And you're a little crazy.
{26695}{26736}That's really nice.
{26751}{26835}I should tell you that crying women|make me very uncomfortable.
{26841}{26925}Well, you're not gonna like|what's coming.
{26987}{27047}I'm sorry, I'm sorry.|I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
{27061}{27096}God.
{27109}{27152}Thank you. Thank you.
{27297}{27377}I'm really fine. Don't worry.|I'm great with children.
{27639}{27712}Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.
{27757}{27825}Please don't fire my friend.|Just let me talk to her.
{27829}{27897}- Okay, but this is her last chance.|- Thank you.
{27901}{27955}How about I do something for you?
{27959}{28033}Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat,|cover up the bald.
{28129}{28201}Listen, Pheebs. I was just talking|to the director...
{28207}{28278}...and he was thinking maybe|this time you don't hit Drake.
{28283}{28316}You just wait on the tables.
{28325}{28393}I can't do that. I'm an actor.|I have a process.
{28399}{28480}You're a masseuse.|You have a table with a hole in it.
{28517}{28578}Wait, I see what's happening here.|You're threatened.
{28583}{28609}What?
{28613}{28696}I'm so good in the scene|that I'm stealing focus from you.
{28701}{28778}Rise to the challenge, Tribbiani,|because I just raised the bar.
{28783}{28812}Come join me up here.
{28927}{29014}Yeah, you can fire her, but I would|call security. She won't go easy.
{29081}{29154}You faked it?|You couldn't have faked it.
{29159}{29255}Yes, you can. You just make|the faces and the noises.
{29303}{29343}Guys can fake it?
{29347}{29417}Unbelievable.|The one thing that's ours.
{29483}{29550}Why would you fake it|when we're trying to have a baby?
{29555}{29619}Well, that's actually why.
{29637}{29693}Look, I'm starting|a whole new career now.
{29697}{29746}I'm not saying I don't want a baby.
{29751}{29833}I'm just saying maybe|we could wait a little while.
{29837}{29871}Like a month?
{29893}{29971}- Or a year?|- Really? You wanna wait a year?
{29975}{30050}It could be less than a year.|I mean, you've heard my stuff.
{30055}{30177}"Pants. Like shorts but longer."
{30245}{30301}Lt'll probably be more than a year.
{30381}{30481}- I really wanna have a baby.|- Well, yeah, me too.
{30547}{30626}Look, I'll just get my old job back.
{30631}{30689}No, I want you to have|a job that you love...
{30697}{30779}...not statistical analysis|and data reconfiguration.
{30785}{30849}I quit, and you learn what I do?
{30919}{31013}I think there's never gonna be|a right time to have a baby.
{31017}{31068}Now you're unemployed,|and in a little while...
{31073}{31146}...you'll find a new job|that'll keep you really busy.
{31151}{31213}There's always gonna be|a reason not to do this...
{31217}{31319}...but I think once the baby comes,|we'll forget about all those reasons.
{31355}{31396}I guess.
{31401}{31471}I mean, it's always gonna be scary|when we have a baby.
{31475}{31533}It's gonna be really scary.
{31537}{31608}I mean, God, when we have a baby...
{31613}{31697}...there's gonna be so much|that we're not able to control.
{31713}{31806}I mean, the apartment's|gonna be a mess.
{31811}{31877}I won't have time to clean it.
{31893}{31957}What if the baby gets|into the ribbon drawer...
{31961}{32025}...and messes up all the ribbons?
{32029}{32081}What if there's no room|for a ribbon drawer...
{32085}{32143}...because the baby's stuff|takes up all the space?
{32147}{32199}Where will all the ribbons go?
{32231}{32288}Should we go make a baby|before you change your mind?
{32293}{32336}- Yes, please!|- Okay.
{32341}{32409}And I promise I will not|fake it this time.
{32413}{32492}Well, I wish I could say the same.|I'm a little shook up.
{32611}{32666}I know you botched|that operation on purpose.
{32671}{32771}I can't prove it yet, but when I do,|you'll be going to jail for murder.
{32775}{32816}I don't care if you are my brother.
{32839}{32888}I'm not your brother.
{32897}{32943}What about my children, Drake?
{32947}{32994}No! No! No!

{256}{308}- You're not helping?|- I tried...
{312}{406}...but apparently singing "I Will Survive"|in a helium voice, not helping.
{464}{513}- Hey, guys.|- Hey.
{578}{639}Don't say that loud.|Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
{705}{756}Good news, everyone.|We finally found a nanny.
{761}{880}- This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.|- Hi.
{885}{944}Somebody's getting a little fussy.
{949}{1031}You're damn right I am. I've been|waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.
{1060}{1116}Okay. You know what,|I'm just gonna take her outside.
{1120}{1176}- No, you stay. I'll do it.|- Okay. Thank you.
{1180}{1262}- Nice to meet you guys.|- Yeah, you too.
{1277}{1330}- Wow, Molly's just great.|- Yeah.
{1335}{1407}Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.
{1418}{1491}- What? You really think she's hot?|- Are you kidding?
{1495}{1575}If I wasn't married,|she'd be rejecting me right now.
{1629}{1657}Joey?
{1662}{1705}How do you think she's doing?
{1757}{1816}Am I the only one that doesn't think|she's hot? Ross?
{1839}{1931}- I mean, she's not unattractive, but...|- Right.
{1935}{1992}...but hot?
{2003}{2047}Thank you.
{2101}{2131}Now that Rachel's gone?
{2137}{2198}So hot, I cried myself to sleep|last night.

{3460}{3511}Hey, Mike,|what's the capital of Peru?
{3515}{3578}- Lima.|- No.
{3626}{3697}It starts with a V|and ends with an X.
{3701}{3793}And hopefully with a T-O|in the middle.
{3807}{3887}You know, come to think of it,|the capital of Peru is "Vtox."
{3944}{3976}- Oh, God!|- What?
{3980}{4035}Okay. I don't want to freak you out|or anything...
{4039}{4084}...but I just saw a rat|in your cupboard.
{4089}{4148}Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.
{4192}{4236}Well, he's your pet rat?
{4241}{4304}Well, not so much a pet as, you know,|an occasional visitor...
{4308}{4439}...who I put food out for.|Kind of like Santa.
{4457}{4545}Except Santa doesn't poop|on the plate of cookies.
{4554}{4624}You can't keep a rat in your apartment.|They're unsanitary.
{4628}{4700}I mean, they transmit leptospirosis|and hantavirus.
{4705}{4742}- What are those?|- I don't know...
{4746}{4805}...but they don't sound|like spa treatments.
{4809}{4870}- You have to get rid of it.|- Okay, fine.
{4874}{4929}If it means that much to you,|I'll get rid of Bob.
{4934}{4974}Thank you.
{4978}{5068}It's so weird you think he's so gross,|yet you're willing to eat his crackers.
{5249}{5294}- Hello.|- Hello.
{5298}{5363}Gavin, I just want to say|thank you again...
{5368}{5440}...for watching Emma yesterday|during the presentation.
{5444}{5489}I really owe you an apology.
{5496}{5562}- For what?|- When we first met, you know...
{5566}{5650}...I thought you were pompous|and arrogant and obnoxious.
{5656}{5719}Is this your first apology?
{5723}{5801}No, I just mean, you know,|first impressions don't mean anything.
{5805}{5922}And I think you're a really good guy.|And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
{5928}{5984}- Morning.|- Hello.
{5988}{6064}But you know what?|Hey, new day, new leaf.
{6068}{6162}I am just really, really happy...
{6186}{6259}I'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's ass|has something more important to say...
{6263}{6330}...so I'll just wait till it's finished.
{6341}{6388}- What?|- I was giving you an apology...
{6392}{6440}...and you were totally|checking her out.
{6445}{6539}I wasn't. I'm in fashion.|I was looking at her skirt.
{6544}{6663}Or was it pants? I didn't really see|what happened below the ass area.
{6677}{6738}Wow, you are really...|You're really a creep.
{6742}{6793}What do you care|if I was looking at her?
{6797}{6829}Are you jealous?
{6834}{6874}Oh, yeah. I'm jealous.
{6878}{6958}"Oh, Gavin. Please,|please look at my ass."
{6989}{7048}Stop looking at my ass!
{7053}{7119}I mean, I just think|you are totally inappropriate. Okay?
{7123}{7204}This is a work environment.|She's your subordinate.
{7209}{7293}But it was okay when you|slept with your old assistant, Tag?
{7297}{7375}That is totally different|for two reasons.
{7379}{7462}One: I didn't know|that you knew that.
{7493}{7580}And two: I wasn't some creep|staring at his ass.
{7584}{7691}We had a... We had a deep,|meaningful relationship.
{7734}{7775}What was Tag's last name?
{7780}{7821}It was...
{7864}{7909}Oh, my God.
{7913}{7998}He didn't... He didn't...|He didn't have a last name.
{8002}{8138}It was just Tag, you know,|like Cher or...
{8147}{8206}...you know, Moses.
{8241}{8298}But it was a deep,|meaningful relationship.
{8304}{8376}You know what? My first impression|of you was absolutely right.
{8380}{8447}You are arrogant. You are pompous.|Morgan! Morgan!
{8451}{8518}- Tag's last name was Morgan!|- It was Jones.
{8525}{8586}What are you, his boyfriend?
{8684}{8778}- Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.|- You mean when you were a baby?
{8787}{8840}Sure.
{8898}{8937}Would you stop staring at her?
{8959}{9002}I wasn't staring.
{9006}{9063}I was leering.
{9077}{9122}What's the big deal with her?
{9126}{9200}Maybe she's attractive|in an obvious kind of way.
{9205}{9284}Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.
{9288}{9351}You know, when it's right there|in your face.
{9355}{9422}Me, I like to have to work|to find someone attractive.
{9426}{9470}Makes me feel like I earned it.
{9498}{9549}Looks like Joey's doing all right|with her.
{9559}{9612}Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys|to back off...
{9616}{9691}...and let Joey get the girl for once.
{9722}{9806}- I'm gonna take her to the apartment.|- Okay. I'll be home right after work.
{9812}{9871}- Okay.|- Okay, bye, Emma.
{9877}{9953}I love you.
{9962}{9995}- Bye.|- Bye.
{9999}{10058}They've elected me to talk to you|about the baby talk.
{10062}{10119}It's not so good.
{10125}{10176}I think it's sweet.
{10182}{10233}Bye, Emma!
{10277}{10396}Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, I would|really prefer if you didn't go after her.
{10402}{10475}- Why not?|- It took months to find a good nanny.
{10479}{10571}And I wouldn't want anything to,|you know, drive her away.
{10576}{10625}So you think I'm just|gonna sleep with her...
{10629}{10708}...and never call her again, and|things are gonna get uncomfortable?
{10712}{10763}Yeah, that sounds about right.
{10784}{10840}Come on, there are plenty|of other women out there.
{10844}{10963}Just forget about her, okay?|She's off-limits.
{10968}{11043}Oh, man! What'd you have to go|and say that for?
{11047}{11135}Now that you told me I can't have her,|makes me want her even more!
{11155}{11218}- What are you, a child?|- Yes!
{11223}{11280}Look, Joey, come on now.|For me, please.
{11285}{11402}Just try to focus your sexual energy|on someone else.
{11414}{11466}Fine.
{11640}{11668}Take me home.
{11795}{11852}- Hey, Mikey.|- Hey, Pheeb.
{11858}{11915}- What are you doing?|- Setting rattraps.
{11921}{12031}- To kill Bob?|- No. No, to test his neck strength.
{12036}{12114}No, I don't want to kill him.|I thought we were gonna capture him...
{12118}{12181}...and, you know, set him free|in the countryside...
{12185}{12231}...where he could meet|a friendly possum...
{12235}{12305}...and a wisecracking owl.
{12312}{12402}- Okay, okay. I'll throw away the traps.|- All right, I'll find Bob. I'll get him.
{12406}{12505}Bob? Bob?
{12509}{12566}Robert?
{12607}{12674}Wait, I think I hear him.
{12687}{12814}Oh, my God! Bob had babies!|Bob's a mom!
{12818}{12856}We'll have to think of a new name.
{12860}{12919}I don't know,|I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.
{12923}{13003}No, no. I mean, I'm not sure that we...
{13041}{13135}Oh, my God. We killed Bob?
{13139}{13203}Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.|Maybe it was a mouse.
{13207}{13264}Susie?
{13366}{13414}What's up?
{13443}{13494}Seriously, dude. Three years ago.
{13538}{13609}Listen, can you do me a favor?|I'm gonna be out today.
{13614}{13647}Can you keep an eye on Joey...
{13651}{13712}...make sure nothing happens|between him and Molly?
{13718}{13769}- You don't trust him?|- Well, no.
{13774}{13839}Some woman who sounded|a lot like Joey called earlier...
{13843}{13935}...and asked for her daughter,|the "hot nanny."
{13954}{14019}Is this your long-term plan,|for me to run interference?
{14023}{14111}Because I could get a job any day now.
{14115}{14201}You do appear right on the cusp|of something.
{14205}{14282}Look, come on, man. I'm sure|he'll lose interest in a week or two...
{14287}{14346}...but for now, could you please|just do this for me?
{14351}{14396}Fine, but don't blame me|if it doesn't work.
{14400}{14463}Because you know once Joey|sets his mind on something...
{14467}{14550}...more often than not,|he's going to have sex with it.
{14584}{14649}Well, I mean,|we've gotta do something. Okay?
{14653}{14745}Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
{14801}{14854}- Picturing that tree?|- I am, yes.
{15036}{15090}Where you going, Joe?
{15195}{15237}For a walk.
{15242}{15288}You mind if I join you?
{15294}{15421}Actually, I'd rather be alone. You know,|I really need to organize my thoughts.
{15451}{15504}Your thoughts?
{15512}{15553}Plural?
{15582}{15666}All right, fine.|I only have one thought.
{15683}{15734}It's about the hot nanny!|I gotta see her!
{15758}{15842}- I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.|- Now you're saying I can't see her?
{15847}{15955}You're killing me! She's forbidden fruit!|It's like, like...
{15959}{16049}...like she's the princess|and I'm the stable boy.
{16078}{16133}Why are you doing this, huh?
{16137}{16194}Did Ross tell you not to let me|go over there?
{16199}{16264}Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.|So I can't let you go.
{16285}{16361}Interesting. Now there are obstacles.
{16400}{16473}Hot nanny and me against the world!
{16477}{16528}This is the stuff great novels|are made of.
{16533}{16594}- Great novels?|- Fine. Mediocre porn.
{16712}{16763}- Gavin Mitchell's office.|- Rachel Greene's office.
{16767}{16804}Give me that phone.
{16839}{16927}Hello, this is Rachel Greene.|How can I help you?
{16954}{17048}Okay then.|I'll pass you back to your son.
{17077}{17145}Hey, Mom.|No, that's just my secretary.
{17219}{17291}Excuse me, Gavin.|I have a question I need to ask you.
{17295}{17368}Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.
{17375}{17456}- Yes?|- Lf you like looking at butts so much...
{17460}{17542}...why don't you just go|look in a mirror?
{17564}{17598}Thank God you finally said that.
{17602}{17681}I saw you make a note on your pad|three hours ago.
{17754}{17811}- Man, I really bug you. Don't I?|- Oh, no. Please...
{17815}{17859}...I don't care about you|enough to bug me.
{17863}{17947}In fact, from now on,|I'm going to take the high road...
{17951}{18035}...and I'm going to be very, very nice|to you, you mama's boy...
{18039}{18071}...starting right now.
{18126}{18160}- Hey, Rach.|- Hi.
{18164}{18208}- Ready for your birthday lunch?|- I am.
{18212}{18286}But first, Monica,|I would like to introduce you...
{18290}{18366}...to my very talented colleague|and more importantly...
{18370}{18438}...my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.
{18443}{18486}- Pleased to meet you.|- Pleased to meet you.
{18490}{18527}Are you coming to Rachel's party?
{18532}{18613}Oh, no, no, no, no. Gavin can't.|He already has plans...
{18617}{18676}...most likely with his mother.
{18691}{18794}I don't mind. I'll cancel them. I would|never miss my secretary's birthday.
{18844}{18944}Why did you invite him?|I can't stand that guy!
{18949}{19008}- You were being so nice to him.|- I was faking it.
{19012}{19056}Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
{19086}{19143}Hey, Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.
{19147}{19218}Right there.|That was so fake!
{19476}{19524}I still can't believe you invited Gavin.
{19529}{19597}He is just the last person|I want to see.
{19602}{19686}You're welcome for the party.|I'm glad you're having a good time.
{19692}{19780}I hope he doesn't show up.|Of course he won't, the guy hates me.
{19784}{19833}- Does he?|- What?
{19844}{19917}Maybe he keeps bothering you|so much because he likes you.
{19921}{19986}It's like in first grade|when Skippy Lange would push me...
{19990}{20049}...because he secretly|had a crush on me.
{20054}{20131}Monica, you think Skippy liked you?
{20135}{20214}Honey, all those boys had a bet|to see if he could knock you over.
{20263}{20337}- She's out. I'm gonna take her home.|- Okay. Thank you.
{20341}{20400}Bye, sweetheart.
{20466}{20527}Do you see what all the guys|see in her?
{20531}{20592}Wouldn't kick her out of bed.
{20605}{20639}No more vodka for me.
{20684}{20743}Hey, Rach. So can I sing|"Happy Birthday" to you now?
{20747}{20831}- Yeah, sure.|- All right.
{20872}{20922}See you later.
{20944}{20988}Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.
{20992}{21020}Give me!
{21048}{21179}- Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!|- Careful! Careful!
{21184}{21240}These are my rat babies!
{21306}{21388}Yeah. We have rat babies now.
{21425}{21513}You brought rats|to my birthday party?
{21518}{21588}So this is what a stroke feels like.
{21593}{21648}Well, I had to bring them.|We killed their mother.
{21653}{21706}They're our responsibility now.
{21711}{21805}You know, they require constant care.|You should know that, you're a mother.
{21850}{21919}Are you comparing my daughter|to a rat?
{21924}{21971}No. Seven rats.
{22009}{22064}We should take them home.|We need to feed them.
{22068}{22135}You're gonna leave my party|to take care of a box of rats?
{22140}{22197}Well, I'm sorry, Rachel,|but I'm not like you. Okay?
{22201}{22265}Not everyone can afford help.
{22443}{22489}Hey, where the hell|are Joey and Molly?
{22493}{22529}I asked you to watch them.
{22534}{22593}I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.
{22621}{22694}Look, we have to stop them|before something happens.
{22702}{22766}Right behind you, big guy.
{22809}{22864}So you see, Molly,|what people don't understand...
{22869}{22957}...is that acting is a discipline.|It takes a lot of hard work.
{22962}{23031}- So where'd you study?|- I didn't go to college.
{23036}{23177}- No, where'd you study acting?|- Molly, people don't study acting.
{23246}{23336}Molly, do you mind giving us|just a minute?
{23342}{23396}- Sure. I'll go check on Emma.|- Thanks.
{23443}{23516}Will the stable boy|never get the princess?
{23524}{23624}What do you think you were gonna do,|have sex with her here on my couch?
{23629}{23706}No. The leather sticks to my ass.
{23738}{23811}This isn't fair. What makes you think|I'm gonna sleep with her...
{23815}{23853}...and then blow her off, huh?
{23857}{23959}Can't you guys open your minds to|the possibility that I actually like her...
{23963}{24011}...and might want something real?
{24049}{24168}Look, the truth is, I haven't felt|this way about anyone since Rachel.
{24173}{24253}Okay?|I didn't think I could ever love again.
{24276}{24312}- Come on!|- Joe!
{24464}{24520}Hi. Is Molly here?
{24525}{24566}Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?
{24578}{24706}- Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.|- Hey.
{24740}{24824}- I'll see you tomorrow.|- Okay.
{25046}{25149}Well, Joey, I guess|we have no problem.
{25175}{25267}It's like my favorite fairy tale|come true.
{25300}{25381}The princess, the stable boy|and the lesbian.
{25464}{25519}Okay. Okay,|you start preparing the formula...
{25523}{25564}...and I'll start changing the box.
{25568}{25643}And then we gotta put them|straight to bed.
{25648}{25693}When did we become|one of those couples...
{25697}{25756}...whose lives revolve around|their rats?
{25796}{25861}Well, you know what?|They're our responsibility now.
{25866}{25950}Okay, fine.|These rats are our responsibility.
{25955}{26012}What happens when they mate|and there are hundreds?
{26017}{26088}Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
{26096}{26155}Yeah, not such a problem with rats.
{26159}{26241}No, they're more of a "love the one|you're with" kind of animal.
{26260}{26310}No. Really?
{26314}{26396}Oh, my... Get off your sister!
{26437}{26498}Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?
{26502}{26577}The... We have seven rats.
{26581}{26644}So, what if each of them|has seven rats...
{26648}{26742}...and then each of those|has seven rats? That's like...
{26817}{26892}That's math I can't even do!
{26916}{26963}What are we gonna do?
{26968}{27025}Well, I know this is gonna|sound crazy...
{27030}{27188}...but we could|not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
{27237}{27323}Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.
{27327}{27407}All right, so we should just|give them away.
{27422}{27554}But to nice families with children|and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.
{27558}{27615}Those were Bob's favorites.
{27619}{27665}It's gonna be okay.
{27696}{27786}- You must think I'm crazy.|- No, I think you're sweet.
{27791}{27945}Good. This is just so hard.|It's hard for me to let them go.
{27950}{28044}I guess it just brings back memories,|you know...
{28058}{28175}...from when I gave birth to my brother's|triplets and I had to give them up.
{28319}{28376}I haven't told you about that yet,|have I?
{28676}{28755}Thanks for the party, honey.|Should I help you clean up?
{28759}{28863}No way. You had your party.|Now I have mine.
{28936}{28988}- Is everything all right?|- I just get bummed...
{28992}{29028}...when my birthday's over.
{29032}{29110}Well, at least you have one thing|to be happy about.
{29114}{29187}That jerk, Gavin, from your office|didn't show up.
{29191}{29255}Yeah, I hate him.
{29307}{29383}We weren't talking about you.|We were...
{29387}{29479}No. No way to recover. No. Okay.
{29520}{29602}- Fun party.|- Well, it was.
{29607}{29674}And you would have seen it|if you didn't show up at...
{29678}{29810}9:30?! God! This party was lame.
{29818}{29884}Again, you're welcome!
{29888}{30001}- Look, I'll just give you this and go.|- You bought me a present. Why?
{30029}{30117}Let me explain how birthday parties|usually work. There are presents...
{30122}{30190}...and a cake,|perhaps a fourth or fifth person.
{30247}{30293}Okay, I...
{30298}{30392}I got you the present to make up|for being such a jerk to you.
{30408}{30516}Well, okay. Well, that's very nice.|And you wrote a card.
{30538}{30597}- "From Gavin."|- I really mean it.
{30771}{30808}It's beautiful.
{30813}{30866}If you don't mind...?|Let me.
{30921}{30999}Well, what do you know, it fits.
{31047}{31153}See, Gavin. You're capable of being|a nice guy.
{31157}{31207}Why do you give me such a hard time?
{31237}{31274}I'm not sure.
{31281}{31398}Well, Monica seems to think|it's because you have feelings for me.
{31404}{31454}I do have feelings for you.
{31499}{31575}- You do?|- Yes. I feel that you're a little annoying.
{31610}{31642}See, why? Gavin, why?
{31648}{31745}Right when I'm about to change|my opinion of you, you go and you...
{31825}{31891}And you do that.
{32521}{32600}Hey. Listen, I think I left something|here.
{32630}{32701}Well, somebody left this.|Is this yours?
{32706}{32741}No, but I like it.
{32770}{32841}No, I think I left one of my rat babies.
{32883}{32952}Well, no. I haven't seen it,|but if I do, I'll let you know.
{32956}{33035}Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!|Rat baby!
{33073}{33097}Maybe that's him.

{95}{148}- Hey.|- Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.
{152}{222}Look, can we talk|about what happened here last night?
{227}{317}Sure. Just give me a second|to get all huffy and weird like you.
{328}{461}You believe that whoever did something|last night did what they did or didn't do?
{477}{540}Okay, you really don't know|what I'm talking about?
{545}{604}- No.|- Okay. Last night, after the party...
{608}{694}...I saw Rachel kissing that jerk|from her office out on your balcony.
{699}{733}Our balcony? Seriously?
{737}{818}That's so funny. I told Monica|we should put lights on our balcony...
{822}{910}...and she said, "No, no. It's too cold.|Nobody will go out there. " And I said:
{914}{973}"Maybe if we put some lights|out there they will."
{1030}{1118}Right, that's what I came over to talk|about. I saw Rachel kissing some guy...
{1122}{1212}...on your balcony,|even though there were no lights!
{1241}{1306}So are you gonna talk to her?
{1311}{1403}Why? Why should I? I mean,|if she wants to move on, that's fine.
{1408}{1494}You know when "that's fine" sounds|true? When someone yells it and spits.
{1512}{1625}No, I'm serious. I mean, if she wants|to date people, fine. I don't care.
{1629}{1681}But at least she could have told me.
{1685}{1769}You know, I've been putting my life on|hold and concentrating on Emma.
{1774}{1909}But if she wants to go out there kissing|guys she barely knows, then so will I.
{1978}{2036}Very funny! Ross is gay!
{2073}{2117}No, no.|Good, so you're moving on.
{2121}{2181}Do you have any idea|where you're moving on to?
{2186}{2231}I've got plenty of opportunities.
{2235}{2343}Just now, there was some woman|at the coffeehouse smiled at me.
{2347}{2480}And then the other day on the subway,|a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
{2496}{2600}Dude, don't rub my face|in your crazy single life.
{2614}{2670}And there's an anthropologist|at school...
{2674}{2764}...who totally came on to me during|the interdepartmental potluck dinner.
{2769}{2832}Why did I get married?

{4054}{4118}Hey, let me ask you guys something.
{4122}{4165}I'm having new headshots|taken tomorrow.
{4169}{4249}The photographer said she thinks|I should have my eyebrows waxed.
{4253}{4308}Is that weird for a guy?
{4313}{4365}- Well, it depends.|- On?
{4370}{4438}On how far along he is|in the sex-change process.
{4478}{4573}No, I totally disagree. I think it's fine|for a guy to do something like that.
{4577}{4615}Especially an actor.
{4620}{4689}I mean, not that you need to.|Your eyebrows are...
{4790}{4857}Stop it, you guys. Stop staring,|you're freaking me out.
{4862}{4917}Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.
{4937}{5001}Oh, man, now I have to get|those done too?
{5006}{5103}- Wow, talk about high maintenance.|- You dye your hair.
{5108}{5185}- I'm a woman.|- Double standards!
{5216}{5287}Before I forget, are you coming|to Mike's piano bar tonight?
{5292}{5384}- Only if I don't have to get up and sing.|- But everybody sings. It's so fun.
{5388}{5488}Last time, this adorable old man got up|there, forgot all the words, flipped out...
{5492}{5597}...and everyone booed him off the stage.|It was so funny.
{5629}{5685}Look, I'm not good at singing.
{5690}{5789}Oh, what's the matter? You scared?|You afraid I'm a better singer?
{5793}{5846}You afraid I'm gonna beat you|at singing?
{5901}{5984}Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.
{5988}{6061}Wow, I must be growing up.
{6101}{6206}Okay, fine. Just please come and|support Mike. You don't have to sing.
{6211}{6310}So I don't have to sing, and I can just sit|there and pass judgment on others?
{6315}{6369}- While drinking.|- I'm there.
{6429}{6489}Hi, you guys.|Listen, I really need your help.
{6494}{6553}I think I did something|really stupid.
{6557}{6645}Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something|so beautiful out of it.
{6708}{6775}No, not that.|I kissed Gavin last night.
{6780}{6806}- My God.|- You kissed him?
{6810}{6872}Yeah, it was after the party,|we were on the balcony...
{6877}{6957}Wait, wait, wait. I was at home|the whole time. How did I miss that?
{6962}{7061}Well, it was the end of the party. You|were probably ironing wrapping paper.
{7081}{7119}Oh, yeah.
{7184}{7229}So how did you end up kissing?
{7234}{7290}We were all alone|and he was being really nice...
{7294}{7371}...and he gave me this scarf.|- I thought you hated him.
{7375}{7441}Well, there is a thin line|between love and hate...
{7445}{7555}...and it turns out that line|is a scarf.
{7600}{7661}Are you thinking of starting|something up with this guy?
{7665}{7738}I don't know. It's so complicated.|I work with this guy.
{7742}{7827}I have the baby, and I have Ross.|I don't know what to do.
{7831}{7909}And I have to be at the office|and see Gavin in 10 minutes.
{7914}{7999}Sounds like you need to think|about what you want and talk to Gavin.
{8003}{8098}- And you definitely should talk to Ross.|- Or...
{8113}{8188}...I could call in sick|and not deal with it at all.
{8213}{8284}Wow! Five months maternity leave,|you're back for four days...
{8288}{8391}...kiss a co-worker and call in sick.|They are lucky to have you.
{8582}{8608}- Hi.|- Hi.
{8612}{8727}- I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.|- Name?
{8732}{8774}Chandler Bing.
{8833}{8868}Okay, very good.
{8872}{8949}Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,|and Sonya will be right with you.
{8953}{9003}Okay. Thanks.
{10092}{10162}I touched the stuff.
{10182}{10236}I'll take care of it.
{10334}{10369}Thanks.
{10373}{10447}So do you...?|Do you get a lot of guys in here?
{10451}{10518}- Oh, absolutely.|- Oh, good.
{10523}{10610}- You looking to meet somebody?|- All right, let's just do this.
{10639}{10702}Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.
{10706}{10772}First, I want to tweeze|some of the strays, okay?
{10776}{10871}- Now, this may sting just a little bit.|- I have an extremely high threshold...
{10875}{10973}Holy Mother of God!|Oh, my face! My face!
{11118}{11173}I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.
{11177}{11258}It's just a bit of shock, that's all.
{11262}{11369}- But I'll be fine. You can go again.|- Okay.
{11453}{11493}Sorry.
{11621}{11680}Damn it, woman!
{11999}{12081}It's the most eligible man in New York.|How's the moving on going?
{12121}{12218}Not well. I went on the subway again|and someone did sit on my hand...
{12222}{12317}...but that person was neither female|nor wearing pants.
{12351}{12446}Maybe you're going about this|the wrong way. I mean, think about it:
{12450}{12557}Single white male, divorced three times,|two illegitimate children.
{12610}{12674}The personal ad writes itself.
{12698}{12793}You know, that's funny. Yeah.|So do you think you'll ever work again?
{12829}{12908}What are you doing?|You know I can only dish it out.
{12926}{13034}I can't believe Rachel just moved on|and didn't say anything to me.
{13038}{13077}Maybe she didn't move on.
{13081}{13168}Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,|one-time birthday thing.
{13172}{13244}No, a month ago, she gave her number|to some guy in a bar.
{13249}{13299}- Did she go out with him?|- No. When he called...
{13303}{13339}...I threw the message away.
{13383}{13431}The highroad.
{13449}{13556}All right, you know what? Enough.|Enough talking. I have to get moving.
{13570}{13682}Hey, check out those two blonds|over there. Hey, come with me.
{13687}{13750}Are you trying to get|everybody divorced?
{13765}{13848}You don't have to do anything.|It'll just be easier if it's two of us.
{13852}{13956}Like college, remember? First, you|break the ice with some kind of a joke...
{13960}{14058}...so they know you're the funny one. I|swoop in with interesting conversation...
{14062}{14164}...so they'll see that I'm the brilliant,|brooding sexy one.
{14237}{14294}I thought I got to make the jokes.
{14337}{14413}- Don't you have to be at work?|- Oh, come on.
{14477}{14597}Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.|This is my friend Ross right here.
{14601}{14639}We were wondering...
{14643}{14739}...if you're up for it, we only need|six more people for a human pyramid.
{14797}{14832}Swoop. Swoop.
{14929}{15020}Hey, I notice|you're reading the paper.
{15024}{15080}Another flood in Europe, huh?
{15137}{15187}Here's a question:
{15218}{15341}Would you rather drown|or be burned alive?
{15373}{15479}- I'm sorry, we're just leaving.|- Okay.
{15554}{15595}We still got it.
{15812}{15909}- Who is it?|- Gavin. I brought you some soup.
{15913}{15973}- Why?|- I heard your were sick.
{15977}{16070}Oh, right! Hold on,|let me just clean up in here a little bit.
{16327}{16378}Hello, Gavin.
{16401}{16447}I missed you at work.|How you feeling?
{16452}{16541}I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
{16545}{16621}Oh, good. Because I was having|a totally paranoid moment...
{16625}{16678}...where I thought you|called in sick to avoid me.
{16683}{16753}Oh, no, no, no.
{16822}{16869}So I had fun last night.
{16887}{16933}So did I.
{16998}{17051}Exactly how contagious|is this thing you have?
{17055}{17181}Is it a cold from standing on|the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?
{17194}{17263}- It's just a cold.|- Do you have a fever?
{17267}{17322}Let me see.
{17459}{17500}What? What is it?|What's the matter?
{17504}{17564}What's Ross doing to you|in that picture?
{17568}{17658}Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.
{17678}{17744}He thought it would be funny.
{17748}{17802}- Right. Right.|- Yeah.
{17806}{17854}- Ross.|- Yeah.
{17873}{17950}What's the deal with you guys? I don't|wanna get in the middle of anything.
{17955}{18075}You're not getting in the middle|of anything. Don't worry about Ross.
{18080}{18137}Hide! That's Ross! Hide!
{18151}{18206}- Hide! Hide!|- Yeah, but you said not to worry...
{18210}{18277}I lied and I'm not sick either!|Just stay behind the curtain!
{18375}{18449}- Hi.|- Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.
{18453}{18522}No. I'm here to take Emma|to your mother's, remember?
{18527}{18565}Right. Yes, yes.
{18583}{18638}- Don't panic.|- What?
{18642}{18696}There is a man behind your curtain.
{18700}{18787}- I have Mace in my purse.|- No, that's okay! No, no, no.
{18791}{18912}This is my business associate Gavin|being silly. Come out from behind there.
{18942}{19017}Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.
{19040}{19099}It was my idea to stand there.
{19103}{19206}- Hello. I'll just go get Emma.|- Okay.
{19263}{19312}So...
{19316}{19407}...why did I have to hide?|- I thought it was Ross.
{19411}{19478}I thought there was nothing|going on between you.
{19483}{19530}There isn't. There totally isn't.
{19534}{19644}You hear keys in the hall and you jump|like a bronco coming out of the chute.
{19699}{19751}I used to be a rodeo clown.
{19818}{19882}All right, look, Gavin...
{19944}{20037}...I guess I felt guilty|that you were here...
{20041}{20089}...which I shouldn't.
{20093}{20179}You know, Ross and I|are not in a relationship...
{20183}{20292}...but he is the father of my child.|And, you know...
{20297}{20383}...we do live together. And plus,|there's just so much history, you know?
{20387}{20433}It's just...|I don't know.
{20437}{20536}- I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.|- It's okay.
{20560}{20635}It's probably not my place,|but can I give you a piece of advice?
{20639}{20722}- Yes.|- You should talk to Ross about all this.
{20747}{20806}People keep saying that.
{20862}{20910}I'm sorry, Gavin.
{20914}{20954}Don't be.
{20958}{21022}It's just bad timing.
{21053}{21105}So seriously, rodeo clown?
{21126}{21190}One of the best, ma'am.|One of the best.
{21870}{21960}Oh, she's my girlfriend.|That's not just how we do it here.
{21966}{22026}I'm gonna take a little break,|and when we come back...
{22030}{22111}...we've got Kenneth singing|"I Touch Myself."
{22127}{22191}I'm not here to judge.
{22274}{22351}- You have got to sing.|- No, I told you I can't.
{22356}{22439}But you would have so much fun.|And you have a really nice voice.
{22455}{22529}- When have you heard me sing?|- All the time, when you're cooking.
{22534}{22572}- What?|- Yeah, you're always singing:
{22576}{22643}"Yummy", "yummy", "yummy"|{y:i}I've got love in my tummy
{22675}{22715}Yeah, I do rock that one.
{22768}{22844}Isn't there just a little part of you|that wants to get up there?
{22865}{22946}Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.
{22950}{22998}I don't even know what I would sing.
{23003}{23067}- Well, I've got a book around...|- "Delta Dawn."
{23273}{23402}Hi. I couldn't help but notice,|but that's an unusual necklace.
{23406}{23475}You already hit on me an hour ago.
{23515}{23603}Right. So that's a firm no?
{23744}{23814}I don't believe this.|I just keep striking out.
{23819}{23877}I don't get it either.
{23881}{23946}I mean, you're obviously desperate.
{23950}{24042}You're asking women|how they wanna be killed.
{24046}{24121}This is great.|Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys...
{24125}{24218}...until she finds the one she wants,|and I'm gonna die alone.
{24223}{24294}By drowning or...?
{24332}{24429}- Why would he break up with me?|- I don't know, sweetie.
{24433}{24536}All I ever wanted was to just love him|and have him love me back.
{24540}{24630}I mean, am I so unlovable?
{24634}{24709}- Wow.|- I know.
{24954}{25018}All right. That was Kenneth with his...
{25022}{25113}...much too literal rendition|of "I Touch Myself."
{25117}{25218}Coming up next, we've got Monica|singing "Delta Dawn."
{25232}{25292}Wait. I can't sing in|front of all these people.
{25297}{25354}Just pretend they're not|even here. It's okay.
{25358}{25470}Once that spotlight hits you, it's so|bright, you won't see anyone anyway.
{25533}{25645}Hi, I'm Monica. And I'm going|to be singing "Delta Dawn."
{26225}{26332}- Can you totally see through her shirt?|- Like an x-ray.
{26353}{26426}Bad day not to wear a bra.
{26724}{26784}I need your help.
{26833}{26883}Wow, it seems serious.
{26898}{26973}What seems to be the problem,|Ashley Judd?
{26977}{27073}I'm getting new headshots taken.|So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.
{27078}{27148}I'm sorry.|Moment to make fun of that, please.
{27165}{27264}I may be a sissy, but I'll still|pound you into the ground.
{27269}{27361}Look, it hurt so bad, I could only|let her do one eyebrow, and now...
{27365}{27431}...they don't match!
{27736}{27825}It's like a baby caterpillar|chasing its mama.
{27829}{27905}You got to help me out, okay?|Look, I have a magic marker.
{27909}{27980}Fill in the skinny one|so I don't look stupid for my pictures.
{27985}{28047}Okay, first of all, this is green.
{28058}{28125}- What the hell am I supposed to do?!|- I will help you out...
{28129}{28240}...but you have to promise you won't|tell anyone what I'm about to tell you.
{28244}{28307}What? What?
{28315}{28347}Okay.
{28351}{28426}You know how most kids get their|allowance from mowing the lawn...
{28430}{28540}...or taking out the garbage?|Well, I earned mine...
{28544}{28687}...by plucking the eyebrows of my father|and his "business partners."
{28797}{28841}Oh, my God.
{28851}{28931}Yeah, well, I guess you don't need|my help, "Victor% Victoria."
{28936}{29009}No, no, no. I do. I do.|I need your help.
{29014}{29101}But, Chandler, I don't know if I can take|any more plucking. It hurt so bad.
{29106}{29220}Not with my combination of ice cubes,|aloe vera and my gentle...
{29224}{29309}...self-loathing touch.
{29682}{29748}I'm sorry, the song's over.
{29805}{29881}- Did you see me up there?|- Every little bit of you.
{29914}{29997}I can't believe I sang|in front of people and they liked me.
{30001}{30064}Did you hear that guy shouting,|"Look at those tips"?
{30068}{30161}I mean, did I really help|you get a lot of tips?
{30165}{30192}Sure.
{30233}{30319}- Mon, not that you didn't sound good...|- Good?
{30324}{30406}Didn't you hear them? I was great!
{30410}{30522}Thank you so much for making me|do this. That is the best gift ever.
{30527}{30593}Also a good gift: Underwear.
{30681}{30746}Thank you so much|for letting me do this.
{30751}{30849}Public bathrooms freak me out. I can't|even pee, let alone do anything else.
{30859}{30946}But what's great is, you don't|mind talking about it.
{30950}{31061}It is so amazing that I met you on the|same day that Eric broke up with me...
{31065}{31158}...because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,|and you get a boyfriend.
{31214}{31333}No, don't worry. This is not some|rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
{31505}{31566}Good choice, Ross.
{31607}{31661}Hey. Hi. There you are.
{31666}{31752}- I've been looking for you everywhere.|- Hello. Well, here I am.
{31757}{31828}My mom is not bringing|the baby back until 9:00.
{31832}{31941}So I was hoping you and I|could have a chance to kind of...
{32001}{32067}- Somebody here?|- Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.
{32071}{32147}- Who?|- Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
{32184}{32264}- You've been seeing someone?|- Yeah, didn't I mention that?
{32268}{32338}I mean, we haven't been|going out too long...
{32342}{32435}...but there's this amazing|connection between us.
{32439}{32530}I mean, in fact just before you came in,|she called me her boyfriend.
{32534}{32631}I thought it was a little too soon,|but also, it felt kind of nice.
{32682}{32774}What are you taking amoxicillin for?
{32899}{32976}How great is this?|You're already comfortable enough...
{32980}{33045}...to look through my stuff.
{33049}{33108}I'm sorry, Michelle,|this is my roommate, Rachel.
{33113}{33163}And I'm also Emma's mother.
{33181}{33265}- Who's Emma?|- I told you about my daughter.
{33269}{33328}This is your daughter?
{33350}{33412}I could be your new mommy.
{33644}{33686}And done.
{33699}{33754}Oh, my God.
{33758}{33832}I didn't feel a thing.|Hey, are you still looking for a job?
{33837}{33922}Because you could tweeze circles|around that sadistic bitch at the salon.
{33956}{34033}- Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?|- Yeah.
{34072}{34151}They totally match.|They look great.
{34155}{34231}They look great. How you doing?
{34258}{34338}Yeah, I think it looks pretty good.|I was a little worried I was...
{34342}{34408}...uncovering a birthmark|right about there...
{34412}{34486}...but it turned out to be|a little piece of chocolate.
{34491}{34552}- Chandler, thank you so much.|- No problem.
{34556}{34639}Listen, that was a pretty|girlie hour we just spent.
{34643}{34702}We should do something manly|to make up for it.
{34706}{34759}Yeah.
{34837}{34894}- Curl my eyelashes.|- Yeah!
{34969}{35087}For my next song, I think I'll sing|something a little more upbeat, all right?
{35091}{35187}How about the Pointer Sisters'|"I'm So Excited"?
{35191}{35247}And make it bouncy.
{35251}{35322}Well, you can probably take care of that|on your end.
{35345}{35440}I'm sorry I'm late. You'll understand|when you see Joey.
{35444}{35530}Honey, you're just in time.|I'm about to sing another song.
{35535}{35600}- Really? In front of all these people?|- And they love me.
{35604}{35706}- Oh, my God.|- She gives the people what they want.
{35710}{35771}All right, watch.
{36179}{36254}Are those my wife's nipples?
{36262}{36357}Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.|I wouldn't have let her go up again.
{36361}{36432}I've got to stop this.
{36743}{36811}Who cares? They still love me.
{36888}{36978}You, touching yourself! Out!
{37116}{37167}Wow! She does that a lot.
{37204}{37287}Ross, you didn't tell me|you were a doctor.
{37292}{37367}Wait a minute. You haven't even|told her you are a doctor yet?
{37371}{37418}How long have you known her,|like an hour?
{37423}{37498}Actually, about an hour and a half.
{37502}{37612}I told you it wasn't long, but there's|an amazing connection between us.
{37616}{37672}You feel that too?
{37676}{37789}- I thought that that was just me.|- Are you kidding?
{37793}{37888}- Do you wanna go away this weekend?|- We'll see.
{37914}{37950}Ross, what's going on here?
{37954}{38025}Are we just bringing strange women|back to the apartment now?
{38029}{38090}I don't know. Are we just kissing|guys on balconies?
{38103}{38190}- How do you know about that?|- Through the magic of sight.
{38263}{38367}- I was here, putting our child to sleep...|- Emma.
{38419}{38491}When I looked through the window|and saw you kissing a guy...
{38495}{38543}...you've known for what, a week?
{38547}{38639}God, is that what this is all about?|You bring her up here to get back at me?
{38644}{38728}No, actually, see, I had to pee|because I can't use public bathrooms...
{38732}{38836}...because of the doody parasites.|- Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.
{38840}{38906}- Well, call me.|- Okay.
{38911}{38953}Wait, you don't have|my phone number.
{38958}{39034}You know what?|If it's meant to be, I'll guess it.
{39070}{39126}Bye-bye.
{39143}{39190}Score.
{39194}{39259}Did you not like her? Because I was|hoping we could come...
{39263}{39312}...to your kissing parties|on the balcony.
{39317}{39402}I can't believe you are making a big deal|about this. It was one kiss!
{39406}{39469}- One guy. One time!|- Oh, really?
{39474}{39537}- Yeah.|- Oh, really?
{39578}{39622}Oh, yeah.
{39627}{39693}- What about the guy from the bar?|- Who?
{39698}{39773}The guy you gave your number to.
{39777}{39880}- How do you know about that?|- Because he called here looking for you.
{39884}{39983}So don't tell me kissing this guy|from work is a one-time thing.
{39988}{40067}Because you've been out there|in bars and on balconies...
{40071}{40171}...for over a month now. And you|don't even have the courtesy to tell me.
{40192}{40260}- Why didn't I get that message?|- What?
{40264}{40355}From the guy in the bar?|Why didn't I get that message?
{40360}{40436}Because I folded it up|and put it in my pants pocket.
{40440}{40516}Do you not look there?
{40563}{40600}Ross.
{40665}{40725}I never gave it to you.
{40729}{40770}Why?
{40811}{40875}- I don't know.|- Oh, God, you know what? I don't...
{40879}{40945}Who do you think you are?|Who are you to decide...
{40949}{41019}...what messages|I should or should not get?!
{41027}{41094}Who am I? I'm the guy|who's taking care of our baby...
{41098}{41177}...while you're at bars meeting guys!|- I cannot believe you.
{41181}{41282}I actually came in here hoping to have|a mature conversation about us.
{41286}{41348}But I can't do that with someone|who hides my messages...
{41352}{41420}...and brings crazy women|back to my apartment!
{41425}{41528}Hey, none of the sane ones|wanted to come back with me!
{41593}{41665}That's not the point, okay?|The point is...
{41669}{41766}...you are the one who moved on|and didn't tell anyone.
{41771}{41870}Oh, God, Ross,|this is just so messed up.
{41874}{41973}What is wrong with us? When people|hear about our situation, they ask:
{41978}{42050}"You live together, but you're not|a couple, yet you have a baby?
{42054}{42154}Isn't that weird?" And I say,|"No. It's not, because it works for us."
{42159}{42205}But you know what?|This doesn't work.
{42209}{42308}- In fact, this is the opposite of working.|- Clearly.
{42350}{42391}And you know...
{42395}{42484}...we said that we would live together|as long as this makes sense...
{42488}{42593}...and maybe this|just doesn't make sense anymore.
{42631}{42690}Yeah, maybe not.
{42720}{42779}So, what do you wanna do?
{42884}{42923}Hi.
{42927}{43010}Can Emma and I live here for a while?
{43015}{43072}God.
{43089}{43182}- Of course.|- Thank you.
{43282}{43350}Your eyebrows look weird.
{43954}{44026}So you'll just touch yourself|for anything, then?

{110}{158}- Morning, roomie.|- Hey!
{162}{255}You remembered|to put clothes on this morning.
{259}{319}Fifth day's a charm.
{324}{452}It's so great to be back here. You're|making it so easy on me and Emma.
{457}{527}It's great having you back.|Stay as long as you want.
{531}{623}And when does she stop|crying all night?
{669}{760}Hey! You're not naked.
{765}{824}Rach, when will we expect|to see you tonight?
{828}{921}Probably around 6. But she's|in the bedroom, all ready to go.
{925}{968}But she fell back to sleep, so...
{973}{1070}She's probably exhausted from all that|adorable screaming she did last night.
{1079}{1110}- Bye.|- Bye.
{1125}{1192}Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it|too hard on you.
{1196}{1248}No, hey, it's been great.
{1253}{1321}I just want you to know that|with Rachel staying here...
{1325}{1402}...all my feelings from before|are totally over.
{1406}{1438}And even if they weren't...
{1442}{1501}...when you walk in|on a woman using a breast pump...
{1506}{1566}- Yeah, that'll do it.|- Wow!
{1579}{1626}So how are you?
{1630}{1679}- I'm okay.|- Really?
{1683}{1783}Sure. I mean, do I wish me and Rachel|living together would have worked out?
{1787}{1879}Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,|but it's not like it's a divorce.
{1919}{1992}- Well, actually it...|- It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!
{2044}{2116}Anyway, I think Rachel and I|need to get on with our lives.
{2120}{2178}Maybe start seeing other people.
{2200}{2243}Wow. Really?
{2248}{2331}Sure, why not? In fact, if you know|anyone that'd be good for me...?
{2335}{2409}- Sure. I know lots of girls.|- Any names come to mind?
{2431}{2468}Names?

{3519}{3593}- I was about to eat. Want something?|- What you got?
{3597}{3684}Okay, let's see, we got strained peas,|strained carrots...
{3688}{3752}...strained plums.|We haven't tried that yet!
{3757}{3787}Goody!
{3802}{3860}Thanks.
{3873}{3938}So how is it living with Rachel again?
{3942}{4005}I mean, apart from the great food?
{4010}{4054}I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just...
{4058}{4118}It's just weird what's happening|with her and Ross.
{4122}{4182}Yesterday he asked me to fix him up|with somebody.
{4187}{4247}Rachel asked me|if I knew anyone for her too.
{4252}{4301}- Why are they doing this?|- I don't know.
{4306}{4362}They're so perfect for each other.|It's crazy.
{4367}{4418}You know what's crazy? These jars.
{4422}{4512}What is there, like, two bites in here?
{4561}{4625}I just wish they'd realize|they should be together.
{4629}{4713}When they moved in together, I|figured that's where things were headed.
{4718}{4795}They should be a family. They should|marry and have more children.
{4800}{4904}Yes. And they should name|one of their kids Joey.
{4909}{4991}I may not have kids. Someone's|got to carry on the family name.
{5044}{5130}You know what? Maybe once they|start dating and see what's out there...
{5134}{5199}...they'll realize how good|they are for each other.
{5204}{5271}Yeah, because it is slim pickings.
{5275}{5349}I had this date last night. Yuck!
{5353}{5439}But we should probably keep it down,|she's still in the bedroom.
{5482}{5563}So, what are we gonna do? Are we|just gonna set them up with people?
{5568}{5656}I know, that just pushes them|further and further apart.
{5660}{5747}I know what we can do. We could set|Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...
{5751}{5812}...so they'll realize|how good they are together.
{5817}{5867}- That's a great plan.|- Yeah.
{5872}{5975}You know what the best part of it is?|I get to do my plan laugh.
{6096}{6203}Okay, shh! Not so loud.|We don't want to wake up...
{6512}{6593}Hi. You guys aren't|doing anything tonight, are you?
{6598}{6682}See, now, why would you assume that?|Just because we're married?
{6687}{6800}I mean, I will have you know|that we are very hip, happening people.
{6804}{6904}Now if you'll excuse me, I have to|get back to reading the obituaries.
{6921}{6995}I was just asking because I need|someone to watch Emma tonight.
{7000}{7042}Sure we'll do it.|What are you up to?
{7047}{7119}- Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.|- Oh, my God.
{7123}{7221}- Why? What's the big deal?|- I figured because you and Ross are...
{7225}{7323}What? Slept together a year|and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
{7362}{7435}I think it's great you're going on a date.|It sounds healthy.
{7439}{7528}I mean, you have needs.|Embrace your womanhood.
{7544}{7629}You want a job? Turn off "Oprah"|and send out a resume.
{7685}{7748}- I'll bring her by around 7, okay?|- That's perfect.
{7752}{7835}You guys are gonna have so much fun.|She's at such a cute age.
{7839}{7927}A couple things. Now that she eats|solid food, she poops around the clock.
{7931}{7998}And watch out for your hair|because she likes to grab it.
{8002}{8109}She's also in this phase where if you|leave the room, she screams, but...
{8113}{8160}Thanks, you guys. Have fun.
{8217}{8323}Suddenly I wish I was reading|my own name.
{8376}{8446}Joey, hey. I'm so excited.
{8450}{8540}- I set Rachel up with the worst guy.|- All right. Who is he?
{8545}{8600}It's a guy I used to massage.|By "massage"...
{8604}{8701}...I mean hold down so he wouldn't|turn over and flash me.
{8705}{8794}- Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.|- Oh, yeah.
{8798}{8924}Okay. She's this really boring woman.|She's a teacher.
{8944}{9045}- A teacher?|- She's into history and foreign movies.
{9049}{9097}And she loves puzzles.
{9122}{9175}Come on, who loves puzzles?
{9179}{9221}Well, Ross does.
{9255}{9307}You're ruining the plan!
{9311}{9387}Joey, you fixed him up|with his perfect woman.
{9392}{9436}- Oh, my God, you're right!|- Yeah.
{9440}{9508}She even reads for pleasure!
{9536}{9641}- How do you know a woman like that?|- I'm not allowed to know smart women?
{9647}{9736}- Joey?|- We met at the library. I went in to pee.
{9789}{9855}- So now what do we do?|- Well, okay.
{9859}{9953}I'll call her and tell her the date's|canceled and find him somebody else.
{9993}{10083}What if we don't find him somebody|else? We'll just tell her the date's off...
{10087}{10192}...but we don't tell Ross. He'll go|to the restaurant and get stood up.
{10203}{10270}I hear that's bad.
{10280}{10353}So this is great. Rachel's|gonna have a terrible date...
{10357}{10453}...Ross gets stood up, and then they'll|realize how good they have it together.
{10458}{10499}Yes, the plan.
{10578}{10615}It's not Santa's plan.
{10683}{10731}No, it's...
{10849}{10955}- Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.|- No, I think we killed it.
{11028}{11063}Emma? Emma, look at me!
{11073}{11182}Well, I think I'll go downstairs|for a while.
{11333}{11400}No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay!|I didn't go!
{11404}{11458}Don't cry, it's just a bit!
{11462}{11551}I'm your uncle Chandler.|Funny is all I have!
{11565}{11663}Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be|ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.
{11668}{11744}So don't touch yourself|for the next 48 hours.
{11769}{11820}I don't do that.
{11825}{11890}I'll try to stop.
{11902}{11948}- Did you say until the 6th?|- Yeah.
{11952}{11992}Today is the 6th.
{11996}{12047}No, it's not.
{12067}{12140}Yes, it's also 2003.
{12145}{12206}Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?
{12210}{12254}I may be done ovulating!
{12258}{12363}I may have also served some very|questionable meat at the restaurant.
{12371}{12440}- Go take the test, see if we're okay.|- Okay.
{12610}{12665}Tough crib.
{12669}{12768}Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?|There's only one here.
{12821}{12926}I might have checked to see|if I was ovulating a couple times.
{12983}{13056}I'm not working! There's not much|to do around here!
{13361}{13415}Excuse me.
{13419}{13499}Is there a woman waiting at the bar?
{13503}{13616}Someone average height, dark hair?|Or perhaps doing a puzzle?
{13621}{13692}There's a drunk Chinese guy.
{13719}{13803}Well, if I'm still here in an hour,|buy him a drink on me.
{13821}{13862}Can I get you another glass of wine?
{13866}{13949}I don't know if I should.|I don't want to be drunk when I...
{13953}{14007}...go home alone tonight.
{14033}{14133}- Got stood up, huh?|- It's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
{14138}{14225}Are you worried your date came,|saw you and left?
{14250}{14308}No!
{14383}{14433}We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
{14438}{14547}Oh, good, because as of 4:00|this afternoon, I am not.
{14575}{14640}So let's do this.
{14645}{14703}- I don't think I can.|- Oh, come on.
{14707}{14797}I know you're not 18 anymore,|but give it a minute.
{14824}{14901}- Because of Emma.|- Oh, my God, Emma.
{14905}{14973}Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.
{14977}{15048}You're right, we can't do this.|We can't leave her alone.
{15052}{15096}Sorry.
{15108}{15147}Unless...
{15151}{15207}...maybe we do it here.
{15211}{15283}I mean, how much can she even|be aware of at this age?
{15288}{15385}She's aware when we leave a room.|She may notice if we start...
{15389}{15436}...canoodling in it.
{15472}{15534}- Canoodling?|- Well, I can't say hump or screw...
{15538}{15588}...in front of the B-A-B-Y.
{15633}{15699}I don't know,|I guess having sex in front of a baby...
{15703}{15779}...isn't so...|- Horrifying? Scarring?
{15783}{15846}Something people go to jail for?
{15894}{15936}- I guess you're right.|- You guess?
{15940}{15995}At that bed-and-breakfast,|we didn't have sex...
{15999}{16072}...because you thought a deer|was staring through the window.
{16076}{16168}Well, what kind of a sick bastard|wants to do it in front of a deer?
{16315}{16405}Wow, everything looks so good.
{16409}{16480}I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
{16542}{16607}I just have to say this.
{16611}{16738}- You're really beautiful.|- Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.
{16765}{16818}I'm kind of funny-looking.
{16861}{16910}- What?|- Look, I mean, come on...
{16915}{17008}...you're way out of my league.|Everybody in here knows it.
{17012}{17067}I bet that guy over there|is probably saying:
{17071}{17138}"Why's she out with him?|He must be rich."
{17183}{17234}Well, I'm not.
{17262}{17347}What do you think you want to order?|I'm real excited about that chicken.
{17352}{17427}I'm not funny, either.
{17431}{17509}So if you were thinking,|"Well, he's not that good-looking...
{17513}{17614}...but maybe we'll have some laughs,"|that ain't gonna happen.
{17643}{17755}Well, come on, Steve,|let's not rule out nervous laughter.
{17805}{17871}Hey, now, wait a minute,|Phoebe told me...
{17875}{17950}...that you owned your own restaurant.|That's impressive.
{17954}{18056}I lost it to drugs.
{18164}{18215}I silk-screen T-shirts now.
{18220}{18305}Really?|What's that like?
{18310}{18402}It's really fulfilling doing something|you hate for no money.
{18434}{18523}That's right. I have no money,|I'm not funny...
{18527}{18659}...I live in a studio apartment|with two other guys.
{18663}{18777}And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
{18867}{18916}Now, come on. Come on, Steve.
{18920}{19002}There must be something|that you like about yourself.
{19042}{19094}I do like my hair.
{19148}{19205}Really?
{19451}{19517}- Hello?|- Phoebe, it's me!
{19530}{19624}I'm going to hunt you down|and kill you.
{19669}{19728}Hey, Rach!
{19738}{19833}This is the worst date ever! How could|you set me up with this creep?
{19838}{19913}You know, you are talking about|one of my dear, dear friends.
{19918}{19986}I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.
{19991}{20055}All right, so he gets a little crazy|when he's stoned.
{20111}{20182}- He's not stoned.|- Did he go out for a cigarette?
{20197}{20266}- Yeah. Four times.|- My dear, sweet Rach.
{20317}{20428}Well, our plan is working.|Rachel's having a miserable time...
{20433}{20505}...and Ross is stood up somewhere|at a restaurant all alone.
{20510}{20558}Pretty soon they'll be back together.
{20563}{20682}By the time anyone's figured out what|we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.
{20713}{20798}Oh, wait, that's the end|of a different plan.
{20837}{20898}She's asleep. Chandler?
{20966}{21029}- What are you doing?|- Emma was doing it.
{21067}{21101}She's asleep.
{21138}{21218}- She's asleep. That means we can...|- Yes. But we have to be fast.
{21222}{21287}Oh, okay, I'll try.
{21292}{21369}- And you can't make any noise.|- Okay, I'll try.
{21540}{21594}Hello?
{21636}{21690}Emma?
{21731}{21808}Hey! Hi!
{21840}{21906}How are you? How are you?
{21910}{21984}Where are your babysitters, huh?
{21991}{22068}Why is the bedroom door closed?
{22201}{22333}You can't have S-E-X|when you're taking care of a B-A-B-l-E.
{22455}{22560}I've got bad news.|The Chinese guy left.
{22599}{22669}If it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
{22674}{22718}Look, you got stood up. Who cares?
{22722}{22792}We're gonna show you a good time.|Sit and relax.
{22796}{22885}In fact, let me bring you|a crab-cake appetizer on the house.
{22898}{22980}Wow, free crab cakes?|Well, that's nice.
{22985}{23086}Although I was hoping|to have sex tonight.
{23220}{23281}Just the crab cakes.
{23285}{23369}What are you doing? Are you trying|to get him to stay? You can't do that.
{23373}{23465}- Just get out of here, okay?|- I'm sorry, what's going on?
{23477}{23553}Okay, the waiters have|a little pool going.
{23557}{23667}We have a bet on how long it'll take|before you give up and go home.
{23703}{23761}What?!
{23765}{23840}You're making money off my misery?
{23845}{23909}Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
{23914}{24023}This is unbelievable. I have never|been so insulted in my life.
{24027}{24119}Now, if you'll wrap up my free|crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
{24191}{24291}Well, that was weird.|You were loud and I was fast.
{24295}{24356}I think we may have|really done it this time.
{24360}{24433}I wish I didn't have to wait|to take a pregnancy test.
{24437}{24492}You may want to get|some more of those too.
{24556}{24589}Where's Emma?
{24593}{24656}Oh, my God, where's Emma?|Where's Emma?
{24661}{24743}Don't ask me.|I was in there canoodling you.
{24764}{24848}Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachel|came home early and picked up Emma.
{24852}{24925}You go look across the hall,|and I'll call her cell.
{24930}{24965}You better hope we're pregnant...
{24969}{25064}...because one way or another,|we're giving a baby back to Rachel!
{25124}{25194}I can't believe I'm crying|in front of you.
{25198}{25250}You must think I'm so pathetic.
{25264}{25334}No, no, no, I admire a man|who can cry.
{25338}{25420}- Really?|- Don't touch my coat.
{25456}{25514}Sorry, that's my phone.
{25518}{25576}- Hello?|- Hey, Rach, how's it going?
{25581}{25651}Oh, my God,|this is the worst date ever.
{25674}{25732}Oh, come on.
{25736}{25835}Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did|you really think that this was going well?
{25902}{25962}- What's up?|- Hey, did you stop by here?
{25966}{26051}{y:i}- No.|- Oh, my God! Then...
{26088}{26134}Thank God! Emma, there you are!
{26198}{26265}What? What do you mean,|"there you are"? Where was she?
{26276}{26405}We were playing peekaboo.|She loves it when I'm dramatic.
{26491}{26585}- Why the hell did you take her?|- Because you two were having sex!
{26634}{26714}- No, we weren't.|- Don't you lie to me.
{26718}{26819}I can tell by Chandler's hair. You are|so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
{26945}{26989}All right. All right, we were.
{26993}{27057}We're trying to make a baby.|Monica's ovulating.
{27061}{27134}It's unacceptable that you'd|have sex with Emma in the next room.
{27138}{27225}- I'll have to tell Rachel about this.|- Please don't. She will kill us.
{27229}{27296}Hey, I gotta. Unless...
{27301}{27337}Unless what?
{27341}{27409}Unless you name|your first-born child Joey.
{27464}{27525}- What? Why?|- Hey, I may never have kids...
{27529}{27589}...and somebody's gotta|carry on my family name.
{27632}{27698}Your family name is Tribbiani.
{27898}{27939}You almost had me.
{28098}{28135}Look...
{28142}{28217}...I think I know the answer|to this question, but...
{28255}{28310}...would you like to make love to me?
{28446}{28516}Really, really not.
{28540}{28589}It's just as well.
{28593}{28652}It doesn't work anyway.
{28851}{28938}All right, well, that's good to know.|Good night, Steve.
{29174}{29243}- Hey, what's wrong?|- I just had a rough night.
{29258}{29299}Crab cake?
{29341}{29383}Well, what happened?
{29388}{29454}This is kind of weird|to talk to you about this, but...
{29458}{29508}Monica told me you had a blind date.
{29512}{29581}- Yeah.|- I did too.
{29585}{29686}But is it technically a date|if the other person doesn't show up?
{29723}{29814}Oh, no. Do you think she walked in,|saw you and left?
{29899}{29957}Why does everyone keep saying that?
{29977}{30059}If it makes you feel any better,|I wish my date hadn't shown up.
{30064}{30134}- That bad?|- Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...
{30138}{30224}...and he thought it would be|appropriate to give me...
{30242}{30278}...this.
{30321}{30389}"Female Body Inspector"?
{30414}{30477}What size is that?
{30507}{30594}Now wait a minute. So they're gonna|name their first child Joey?
{30598}{30663}How do I get them to name|the next one after me?
{30667}{30739}It's easy. You just|walk in on them having sex.
{30762}{30839}Oh, so they owe me,|like, three Phoebes.
{30858}{30927}Oh, my God!|Look, it's Ross and Rachel!
{30932}{30972}The plan is working!
{31003}{31066}Don't do the plan laugh.
{31091}{31189}The first dates we've had in months,|and they were both such disasters.
{31241}{31287}You know, it is weird...
{31291}{31398}...that Phoebe would set me up|on a date that was awful...
{31402}{31512}...on the same night Joey set you up|on a date that didn't even show.
{31533}{31590}Wait a minute.
{31594}{31665}You don't think it was intentional?
{31669}{31730}I mean, that's just stupid.
{31735}{31786}We're geniuses.
{31812}{31932}- Look at them! They're really bonding.|- They're falling in love all over again.
{31975}{32037}Oh, they see us. Oh, they look mad.
{32082}{32137}They figured it out.|They're coming. Run!
{32141}{32192}- Where?|- Mexico!
{32326}{32395}Can you believe they're still not here?
{32399}{32480}I know. A double blind date|and we both get stood up.
{32484}{32537}What are the chances?
{32556}{32615}I know, I'm so bummed.
{32619}{32676}Could we have|our free crab cakes now?
{32716}{32785}- What?|- We've been stood up.
{32789}{32861}And we want our free crab cakes.
{32866}{32928}Guys, give it a rest.|Nobody's betting on you tonight.
{32932}{33037}Although we do have a pool going|to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
{33075}{33141}I have such fat hands!

{75}{141}Guys! Guys! I've got great|news. Guess what.
{158}{202}- Monica's pregnant!|- Really?
{261}{311}Let's get past the moment.
{320}{360}- What's your news?|- Thank you.
{370}{418}I got a job in advertising.
{451}{495}Honey, that's incredible!
{500}{578}Gosh, what's the pay like?
{614}{669}Oh, come on, people.
{673}{726}If I don't know who makes the most...
{730}{810}...how do I know who|I like the most? Hi, Joey.
{847}{894}It pays nothing. It's an internship.
{899}{944}We have interns at "Days of Our Lives".
{949}{1022}Right. So it'll be the same,|except less sex with you.
{1070}{1121}What do you think they'll|have you do there?
{1126}{1201}It's a training program, but they|hire the people they like.
{1206}{1277}- That's great!|- There's gonna be some grunt work...
{1281}{1368}...which will stink. A grown man|getting people coffee is humiliating.
{1438}{1509}Humiliating and noble.
{1522}{1568}Thank you.
{1608}{1660}You know, if I didn't|already have a job...
{1664}{1714}...I would've been good in advertising.
{1719}{1784}Ross, you did not come up with:|"Got Milk?"
{1789}{1836}Yes, I did! I did!
{1884}{1949}I should've written it down.

{3184}{3262}Where's Chandler? I want to wish|him good luck on his first day.
{3267}{3326}And I smelled bacon.
{3342}{3408}- He just left.|- Who did?
{3452}{3511}Joey, you're never gonna|believe it! She called!
{3516}{3553}- She did?|- You got it!
{3557}{3597}- I did?|- What is she talking about?
{3602}{3655}I don't know, but it sounds great!
{3659}{3711}Your agent called.|You got that audition!
{3716}{3748}- With Leonard Hayes?|- Yes!
{3752}{3841}Oh, my God, that is great!|It's for a play on Broadway.
{3845}{3944}And in a real theater. Not that little|one underneath the deli like last time.
{3949}{3988}- Is it a good play?|- It must be.
{3992}{4078}I read it and didn't|understand a single word!
{4083}{4148}- Leonard Hayes is starring in it.|- Yeah, and directing.
{4153}{4212}He was so good in|that movie of "Macbeth".
{4217}{4308}- You saw that?|- No, but I saw the previews.
{4312}{4389}They played it right before "Jackass".
{4405}{4450}- He's done some amazing work.|- Oh, yeah.
{4454}{4507}I loved him in those phone commercials.
{4511}{4605}When the monkey hits him in the face|with the giant rubber phone...
{4610}{4655}Maybe the monkey|will be at the audition.
{4660}{4750}Don't make me more nervous|than I already am!
{4965}{5031}- Good morning.|- Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?
{5035}{5106}Oh, no, no. I'm an intern,|just like you guys.
{5110}{5220}Except for the tie, the briefcase|and the fact that I can rent a car.
{5225}{5268}Seriously, you're an intern?
{5273}{5371}I'm heading in a new career direction|and you gotta start at the bottom.
{5375}{5435}Dude.
{5445}{5570}I know I'm a little older than you guys,|but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
{5640}{5691}The comedian. USO.
{5730}{5814}It's U.S.A., sir.
{5955}{6028}This is Joey Tribbiani.|Joey, these are the producers.
{6032}{6103}And as you probably already|know, this is Leonard Hayes.
{6202}{6323}It is so amazing to meet you.|I am such a big fan of your work.
{6328}{6396}I've been blessed with|a lot of great roles.
{6406}{6524}Tell me about it, huh?|"Unlimited nights and weekends!"
{6552}{6631}Are you making fun of me?|Because I am not a sellout.
{6636}{6700}I didn't do it for money.|I believe in those phones!
{6704}{6809}I almost lost a cousin because|of bad wireless service.
{6814}{6913}No, I wasn't making fun of you. I think|you were great in those commercials.
{6917}{6949}- Really?|- Yeah.
{6953}{7027}Well, I do bring a certain|credibility to the role.
{7054}{7132}Are you kidding? When they shoot|you out of that cannon...
{7150}{7216}"Hang up that phone!"
{7220}{7296}- One take.|- Wow.
{7301}{7373}- So shall we read?|- Oh, yeah, sure.
{7377}{7474}Top of Act 2. This is my entrance.|You got it?
{7559}{7622}What the hell are you still doing here?
{7684}{7741}- I think you know.|- Bastard!
{7746}{7830}I am what you made me.|You know what? I could go right now.
{7835}{7899}- Go! Go!|- I can't.
{7903}{7992}Oh, I want to, Long Pause...
{8044}{8095}...but I can't.
{8116}{8261}So sorry. You're not supposed|to say "long pause."
{8300}{8406}Oh! Oh, I thought that was your|character's name. You know?
{8410}{8494}I thought you were, like, an Indian|or something, you know, with the...
{8536}{8635}No. Thank you so much for coming in.|We appreciate it. Thank you.
{8639}{8683}You don't want me to do it again?
{8687}{8726}- I could do an accent.|- No.
{8730}{8852}You know, Southern.|"I could go right now, mon!" Huh?
{8915}{8970}My God in heaven.
{8983}{9101}Joey, hang on. Leonard, can|we talk to you for a moment?
{9105}{9253}Yes? You've got to be kidding.|He can't act.
{9258}{9299}I don't care if you think he's hot.
{9303}{9415}If you want to sleep with him,|do it on your own time. This is a play.
{9421}{9474}If you insist on this...
{9478}{9527}...I will call my agent so fast...
{9531}{9623}...on a cell phone connection so clear,|he's gonna think I'm next door!
{9667}{9777}Hi, thank you so much for|whispering for my benefit.
{9782}{9888}Tell me what I did wrong. I'd love to|work on it and try it again for you.
{9892}{9945}And also, how you doing?
{10028}{10136}Give me another chance.|I really want to get better. Please?
{10173}{10226}If you want to come back today...
{10230}{10272}...here are my notes. Ready?|- Yeah.
{10277}{10414}- You're in your head. Thinking too much.|- I really doubt that.
{10419}{10508}No, no. It's that you're not|connected with anything in your body.
{10513}{10566}There's no urgency.|The scene is a struggle.
{10570}{10655}It's a race.|Also, what you did was horizontal.
{10659}{10729}Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.
{10740}{10860}And don't learn the words.|Let the words learn you.
{10976}{11025}Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
{11120}{11170}Hey, do you want to go|to dinner tonight?
{11174}{11266}I can't. I've got a date|with that waitress, Katie.
{11270}{11346}I know we've only gone out,|like, twice, but I don't know...
{11350}{11469}...I have a good feeling about her.|- Oh, I hear divorce bells.
{11474}{11538}Give me your wallets,|and there won't be a problem.
{11542}{11585}- What?|- I have a gun.
{11590}{11666}Okay, relax, Phoebe.|Just stay calm.
{11713}{11772}Oh, my God, I can't find my wallet!
{11819}{11908}- All right, lady, now give me your purse.|- No.
{11913}{12011}What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd|be my death, Phoebe Buffay!
{12032}{12100}- Lowell, is that you?|- Phoebe?
{12105}{12217}- Oh, my God!|- Unbelievable! Oh, my God!
{12221}{12328}I'm sorry. Ross, this is my old friend,|Lowell, from the streets!
{12332}{12390}- Lowell, Ross.|- Ross, nice to meet you.
{12395}{12446}Yeah, a real pleasure.
{12464}{12552}It's been so long! Oh, so long.
{12557}{12640}- I can't believe you're still doing this.|- I know. But I quit smoking.
{12645}{12687}Good for you.
{12691}{12732}You look like you're doing well.
{12737}{12799}I guess your mugging days|are behind you.
{12804}{12884}Oh, my God.|Phoebe, you used to mug people?
{12920}{12990}Excuse me, Ross,|old friends catching up.
{13120}{13203}- How'd the audition go?|- They want to see me again, but...
{13207}{13273}...Leonard Hayes did not like me.
{13277}{13365}- What happened?|- He said I wasn't urgent enough.
{13369}{13509}Everything I did was horizontal,|and I should be more vertical.
{13515}{13648}- He said that I should think less.|- Well, so far so good.
{13653}{13704}Honey, I'm old!
{13734}{13759}What's wrong?
{13764}{13893}I am so much older than these other|interns. I can't compete with them.
{13898}{13931}So you're a little older.
{13935}{14004}Look at the positive.|You have all this life experience.
{14009}{14142}Yes, but I don't think life experience|is gonna help me with these.
{14147}{14289}Wow! It's like they're on fire!
{14395}{14455}- What are they?|- Prototype sneakers.
{14459}{14519}I need ideas on how to sell them.|Which I can't do...
{14523}{14586}...because no self-respecting|adult would ever wear these.
{14591}{14629}I'll give you $500 for them.
{14727}{14800}- What am I supposed to do?|- Come on, sneakers are easy.
{14804}{14893}- You wear them all the time.|- They're not called sneakers anymore.
{14897}{15039}They're called "kicks" or "skids."|I think I heard somebody say "slorps."
{15076}{15166}They've got wheels that pop out from|the bottom so you can roll around...
{15170}{15252}...because apparently|walking is too much exercise.
{15256}{15361}"Kids! Kids! Roll your|way to childhood obesity!"
{15405}{15457}Would you help me try to sell these?
{15475}{15583}Okay. Have you considered|using a girl with huge knockers?
{15602}{15647}That's not what they're looking for.
{15652}{15713}Hey, that would work on me.
{15717}{15766}Why do you think I buy|Mrs. Butterworth's?
{16023}{16078}You'll never guess what just happened.
{16082}{16146}- Phoebe and I got mugged!|- Are you okay?
{16151}{16213}Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.
{16234}{16267}How do you know a mugger?
{16272}{16374}I'm sorry, I have friends|outside the six of us.
{16378}{16453}Know how she knew him?|Because Phoebe used to mug people.
{16458}{16499}Seriously?
{16503}{16588}Well, I'm not proud of it,|but, you know...
{16592}{16717}...when I was living on the street and|I needed money for food and stuff...
{16722}{16815}- That is awful.|- I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?
{16819}{16917}I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.
{16922}{17021}I had a hard life.|My mother was killed by a drug dealer.
{17026}{17140}- Your mother killed herself.|- She was a drug dealer.
{17160}{17279}It was a good thing she knew him.|I was about to do some serious damage.
{17284}{17317}Okay.
{17357}{17429}This must have brought back|some bad memories for you, Ross.
{17434}{17501}- Why?|- Ross was mugged as a kid.
{17506}{17584}- You were?|- Yeah. And it was pretty traumatic.
{17588}{17640}It was outside St. Mark's Comics.
{17644}{17764}I was minding my business, seeing what|kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.
{17769}{17818}Wonder Woman.
{17846}{17897}Anyway, I was heading|towards this bakery...
{17901}{18013}...to pick up a couple of dozen|linzer tortes for someone...
{18056}{18139}...when out of nowhere, this thug|with a pipe jumps out and says:
{18143}{18198}- "Give me your money, punk!"|- Oh, my God.
{18202}{18271}I know. And the worst part|was, they took my backpack...
{18275}{18415}...which had all the original artwork I did|for my own comic book, "Science Boy".
{18427}{18496}Oh, yeah! What was|his super power again?
{18501}{18570}A super-human thirst for knowledge.
{18623}{18660}I better get to class.
{18664}{18741}Are there any more of your|friends I should look out for?
{18746}{18820}No. Actually, you might want to stay|away from Jane Street.
{18824}{18913}That's where Stabby Joe works.
{18984}{19052}- I think we have a problem here.|- What?
{19057}{19180}Back in my mugging days,|I worked St. Mark's Comics.
{19184}{19293}- Yeah?|- A pipe was my weapon of choice...
{19297}{19373}...and preteen, comic-book nerds|were my meat.
{19416}{19441}So?
{19446}{19529}There was one kid who had|a sticker on his backpack that said:
{19534}{19587}- "Geology rocks!"|- "Geology rocks!"
{19662}{19756}- Oh, my God!|- I know! I mugged Ross!
{19908}{19954}- You're late.|- I know. I'm sorry.
{19958}{20000}But can I just run to the bathroom?
{20005}{20101}- No. Leonard doesn't wait.|- But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!
{20132}{20194}Joey, here we go!|Let's go. Very quickly.
{20199}{20256}- I really need...|- We must go now, quickly.
{20261}{20334}- Yeah. Yes, sir.|- Ready?
{20355}{20448}- What the hell are you still doing here?|- I think you know!
{20469}{20562}- Oh, you sick bastard!|- I am what you made me! Know what?
{20566}{20632}- What?|- I could go right now.
{20685}{20825}- Then go. Go!|- Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!
{20889}{20954}Cut. That was good!
{20958}{21043}- Very good. You did everything I asked.|- I did?
{21047}{21133}Yes. Plus which, you've got this,|I don't know, this squirmy quality...
{21145}{21209}...you bring to the character|I couldn't have imagined.
{21214}{21250}Here's what we're gonna do:
{21254}{21315}Come back tomorrow|for the final callbacks.
{21319}{21394}Do all of this, what you got|going now. But you know what?
{21398}{21436}More. More. Can you do that?
{21440}{21544}Sure. I don't have time to say|thank you because I really gotta go!
{21579}{21674}Look at that! Still in character.|I like him.
{21678}{21793}I plant seeds. I can't explain it.|I don't know.
{21894}{21961}- Hey. What are you doing?|- Putting on the sneakers...
{21966}{22030}...to get in the young mindset,|see if it sparks anything.
{22035}{22100}- Oh, anything yet?|- Yes, how's this?
{22104}{22225}"They're so uncomfortable, it's like|getting kicked in the nuts for your feet."
{22552}{22614}You're probably wondering|what I'm doing.
{22621}{22657}No, that seems about right.
{22681}{22797}Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.|Apparently, that makes me a good actor.
{22801}{22873}I got a callback, so I'm drinking|everything. Oh, by the way...
{22877}{22933}...that eggnog in our fridge was great!
{22938}{23047}- Joey, that was formula.|- We gotta get more of that.
{23094}{23198}These aren't half bad. You should|suggest these to Ralph Lauren.
{23203}{23326}Okay, first of all, that's stupid.|Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
{23336}{23457}All right. I feel younger already.
{23498}{23582}Yeah, I think I broke my hip.
{23615}{23651}- Hey, you!|- Hey.
{23656}{23717}Hey. How was class?
{23736}{23787}No one asks me that. What's wrong?
{23815}{23888}- Nothing. I really want to know.|- Oh.
{23892}{23997}Well, there was actually a rather lively|discussion about the Pleistocene...
{24002}{24062}All right, nothing is worth this.
{24091}{24156}I have a confession to make.
{24160}{24233}Okay, you know that girl that|mugged you when you were a kid?
{24241}{24374}What are you talking about?|It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
{24379}{24462}You don't have to lie anymore.|I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.
{24467}{24504}- No, it wasn't.|- Yes, it was.
{24509}{24609}You don't think I would have defended|myself against a 14-year-old...?
{24614}{24703}- "Give me your money, punk!"|- Oh, my God, it was you!
{24740}{24834}I can't believe it. You mugged me?
{24852}{24936}Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.|I'm sorry.
{24940}{25006}But, you know, if you think|about it, it's kind of neat.
{25047}{25146}I mean, well, it's just that I've|always felt kind of like an outsider.
{25150}{25235}You know, the rest of you have|connections that go way back...
{25239}{25350}...and, you know, now you|and I have a great one.
{25377}{25421}It's not the best!
{25445}{25524}I know. Please forgive me.|I don't know what to say.
{25529}{25618}There's nothing you can say! That was|the most humiliating thing ever.
{25623}{25700}- Even more humiliating than...|- Let's not do this!
{25774}{25864}And then, at the end of the commercial,|the girls get out of the hot tub...
{25868}{25927}...and start making|out with each other.
{25978}{26037}That's interesting.
{26050}{26134}Just one thought: You didn't|mention the shoes.
{26190}{26257}Who's next? Chandler.
{26269}{26329}You start with a guy|putting on the shoes.
{26333}{26382}- He's about my age.|- Your age?
{26443}{26516}He's rolling down the street|and he starts to lose control.
{26520}{26581}Maybe he falls.|Maybe he hurts himself.
{26585}{26674}Just then, a kid comes flying|by wearing the shoes.
{26678}{26765}He jumps over the old guy and laughs.|And the line reads:
{26769}{26834}"Not suitable for adults."
{26855}{26950}- Well, Chandler, that's great.|- Thank you, sir.
{26954}{27042}Or, man who's two|years younger than me.
{27057}{27172}You see, that has a clear selling point.|It appeals to our key demographic.
{27176}{27248}- How did you come up with that?|- I don't know! I don't know!
{27252}{27389}I was just trying to get into a young|mindset, and stuff started to flow.
{27435}{27505}- That is great. Good work.|- Thank you.
{27510}{27574}We'll see all of you tomorrow.
{27798}{27881}The cold weather hurts my hip.
{27979}{28134}Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at|me, but can I just talk to you for a sec?
{28139}{28250}Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.|Sure, go ahead.
{28255}{28330}I just really wanted to apologize again.
{28334}{28450}And also show you something|I think you'll find very exciting.
{28491}{28585}Oh, my God! "Crap from the street!"
{28685}{28747}Look, Ross. In this box...
{28751}{28861}...are all the things I got from mugging|that I thought were too special to sell...
{28865}{28912}...or smoke.
{28949}{29021}Anyway, I was looking|through it, and I found...
{29037}{29080}..."Science Boy."
{29115}{29194}Oh, my God!
{29235}{29303}I never thought I'd see this again.
{29352}{29388}It's all here!
{29434}{29501}What made you save|it all these years?
{29506}{29565}I guess I just thought|it was really good.
{29569}{29626}And maybe it would be|worth something one day.
{29646}{29730}You really thought "Science Boy"|was worth saving?
{29735}{29857}Yeah. But you should know I also have a|jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.
{29922}{29994}Still, this is amazing!
{29998}{30045}Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.
{30050}{30156}You're welcome. Thank you for|Science Boy. I learned a lot from him.
{30170}{30206}You're welcome.
{30275}{30360}- I need an answer!|- I can't tell you something I don't know.
{30364}{30409}- You know!|- I don't know!
{30414}{30556}- I need an answer now!|- You want an answer? The answer is...
{30744}{30803}She never loved me.|She only loved you.
{30808}{30873}You knew this all along|and you never told me?
{30877}{30999}I can never forgive you, or myself. I have|nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!
{31047}{31101}Absolutely amazing.
{31155}{31252}- The part is yours.|- Thanks! Now I really gotta go.
{31257}{31351}No, wait! Congratulations!|You did it.
{31355}{31431}You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.
{31729}{31780}Wow! That's a big cable bill.
{31821}{31929}You don't have a job,|but you have no problem ordering porn.
{31944}{32004}On a Saturday afternoon?
{32012}{32069}I was in the house!
{32122}{32199}Hey. Phoebe didn't by any|chance mention that...
{32204}{32263}She was the huge guy that|mugged you? Yeah.
{32292}{32352}I see. You didn't happen to tell...
{32357}{32434}- Everybody we know? Yeah.|- Great. Thanks.

{100}{159}Have you seen our bank statement?|Can this be right?
{164}{254}I know. God, I haven't seen|my savings take a hit like this...
{259}{368}...since I was a kid and they came up|with Double Stuf Oreos.
{372}{464}- What happened to all of our money?|- I'm not sure exactly what they did...
{469}{532}...but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
{566}{666}With you doing the internship, we're|spending more than we're bringing in.
{691}{779}Yeah, maybe I should quit|and get a job that pays.
{785}{846}But you're finally doing something|that you love.
{851}{908}I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.
{913}{1036}Although it would be nice if the thing|that you loved was finding gold.
{1041}{1107}You know, I think we're making|too big a deal out of this.
{1111}{1205}We'll pay our bills late this month. Next|month we'll cut back on a few things.
{1209}{1311}And maybe we start eating|out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.
{1315}{1414}You're a chef. What can you make|out of baking soda and beer?
{1419}{1490}Worst-case scenario is, we borrow|some money from my parents.
{1494}{1537}No, we're not borrowing money.
{1541}{1612}- Why not?|- We don't do that. We are Bings.
{1663}{1724}If there's one thing my father|taught me, it was...
{1729}{1844}...well, to always knock|before going into the pool house.
{1849}{1962}- The other thing is, never borrow money.|- I had no idea you had this much pride.
{1966}{2058}That's right, I do. I am your man.|I'm gonna get us through this situation...
{2062}{2146}...even if it means you working|twice as hard.

{3100}{3149}- I'm gonna go.|- Why?
{3155}{3225}I haven't been home in days,|and I need to get more clothes.
{3230}{3297}You don't have to go.|I have something that'll fit you.
{3323}{3399}I put that tube top on as a joke.
{3427}{3491}- I want you to stay.|- I want to stay too.
{3495}{3556}But I've got as much use|out of these boxers as I can.
{3567}{3614}- Why don't you turn them inside...|- Done it.
{3655}{3729}- I'll be back in a couple of hours.|- All right. I'll miss you.
{3734}{3787}Me too.
{3883}{3969}You know what? I just realized|something. I don't want to go home.
{3974}{4077}- Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.|- No, no, what I mean is...
{4081}{4149}...I hate going back|to my apartment now.
{4154}{4254}Partly because I live above|a known crack den...
{4258}{4335}...but, you know, mostly because|when I'm there, I really miss you.
{4377}{4430}So...
{4445}{4512}...do you want to move in together?
{4529}{4588}Wow, Mike Hanigan...
{4592}{4669}...you sure know how to|make a girl say "Hell, yeah."
{4684}{4770}- So we're doing it?|- Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.
{4818}{4883}- We're really gonna move in together?|- Yeah.
{4897}{4991}I've always wanted to live with a guy.
{4995}{5061}Pick up your socks.|Put down the toilet seat.
{5065}{5151}No, we are not having sex anymore.
{5156}{5220}It's gonna be fun.
{5260}{5331}- Hey, Joey.|- Hey.
{5336}{5424}Listen, I need to know|that what I'm about to ask you...
{5429}{5515}...will never get back to Chandler.
{5577}{5680}I'd be lying if I said I hadn't|thought about it myself.
{5720}{5818}But Chandler is my best friend.|It would be wrong.
{5822}{5896}Good, but wrong.
{5926}{6010}Okay, first of all, it would be great.
{6014}{6094}But that's not what I'm here to talk|to you about. I need to borrow money.
{6100}{6177}Oh, I don't know, Monica.|You know...
{6181}{6228}...lending friends money|is always a mistake.
{6234}{6336}- But Chandler lent you money.|- And he would tell you it was a mistake.
{6340}{6426}Come on, I just... I need it|for some rent and some other bills.
{6477}{6505}Well, how much?
{6510}{6578}- Two thousand dollars?|- Two thousand dollars?
{6582}{6668}What do you think I am,|a soap opera star?
{6673}{6738}- Yeah.|- That's right, I am.
{6802}{6857}- Hi, you guys.|- Hey.
{6862}{6942}- What's in the bag?|- You know how Emma started crawling?
{6946}{7040}I realized that this place|is very unsafe for a baby...
{7045}{7139}...so I went to the store and I got some|stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
{7144}{7191}Oh, God, baby-proofing.
{7197}{7279}Why is it such a big deal now?|You know, when I was a kid, it was like:
{7284}{7362}"Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs."
{7366}{7466}Or, "Whoops, Joey electrocuted|himself again."
{7488}{7580}Anyway, are you going to get|a handyman to install this stuff?
{7585}{7669}No, I was just gonna do it myself.
{7724}{7792}- You're gonna do it?|- Yeah. Why?
{7796}{7911}- You don't think a woman can do this?|- Women can. You can't.
{7940}{8038}Monica, will you please tell Joey|that he is a pig.
{8042}{8132}- You're a pig. And you can't do this.|- What?
{8136}{8220}What? Come on, I found|the hardware store all by myself.
{8226}{8269}The store's right down the street.
{8275}{8359}There is a hardware store|right down the street?
{8421}{8497}Hey, you guys?|Okay, we've got great news.
{8502}{8584}- Phoebe and I are moving in together.|- Congratulations.
{8588}{8672}I know, it's so exciting. You know,|I've never lived with a guy before.
{8678}{8772}Well, it's just like living with a girl,|only they don't steal your makeup.
{8777}{8857}Unless they're playing "This Is What|My Sister Would Look Like."
{8881}{8940}Yeah, she's not so cute.
{8956}{9034}- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.|- Well, you put down the toilet seat.
{9039}{9086}Yes, dear.
{9110}{9192}- Is that a bit you guys do?|- Uh-huh. We're playing you two.
{9249}{9325}We don't do that.|Tell her we don't do that.
{9330}{9407}Yes, dear.
{9412}{9490}I can't believe you're moving in|together. I'm happy for you guys.
{9497}{9569}- I hear wedding bells.|- Monica, slow down, okay?
{9573}{9637}I'm just excited to be living with him.
{9641}{9688}You know, I mean, I don't know...
{9693}{9775}...can I see someday being|married to Mike? Sure. Yeah.
{9779}{9861}I could picture myself walking down|the aisle in a wedding dress...
{9866}{9950}...that highlights my breasts|in an obvious yet classy way.
{9998}{10069}But do I want that house in Connecticut|near the good schools...
{10073}{10184}...where Mike and I could send|little Sophie and Mike Jr.?
{10189}{10230}Oh, my God, I do.
{10246}{10353}- I had no idea you were so conventional.|- I know. I guess I am.
{10358}{10446}Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,|I want to be a soccer mom.
{10503}{10560}- You ready to go?|- Yeah, you bet, roomie.
{10565}{10643}Don't you mean "groomie"?
{10682}{10731}- What are you talking about?|- Please.
{10736}{10851}We haven't even moved in yet, and|they have us picking out china patterns.
{11024}{11090}China patterns!
{11154}{11228}This is easy. "Can't do this..."
{11352}{11429}Wow, seriously. Can't do this.
{11557}{11583}- Hey, Joe.|- Hey.
{11592}{11690}Listen, I need to ask you a favor, and|we can't tell Monica anything about it.
{11695}{11802}- I thought you guys didn't have secrets.|- That will remain the official party line.
{11870}{11952}Look, Monica and I are having|a little financial trouble.
{11960}{12021}- Yeah, I know.|- What? What do you mean, you "know"?
{12083}{12128}I just figured it out, you know?
{12133}{12242}I mean, you're not working,|and the economy is bad.
{12251}{12281}Oh, right.
{12286}{12364}That is the fastest I have ever thought.
{12402}{12457}Anyway...
{12480}{12531}...I need to borrow some money.
{12537}{12602}Oh, sure. Yeah, how much?|Two thousand dollars?
{12660}{12728}Yes, $2000 exactly.|How did you know that?
{12800}{12917}I know how much you used to make,|and I know how much your rent is.
{12937}{12986}Oh, okay.
{12991}{13046}I am on fire.
{13073}{13149}Listen, this is really nice.
{13182}{13256}Did you write a check to Monica|for $2000?
{13260}{13299}Did Monica borrow money from you?
{13346}{13410}- Kind of.|- I can't believe her.
{13414}{13465}Did she tell you we were having|money problems?
{13470}{13540}No, no, no. It wasn't because|of your money problems.
{13544}{13617}It was for something for her.
{13622}{13661}What?
{13666}{13692}Something personal.
{13699}{13770}What would she get for $2000|that she wouldn't tell me about?
{13774}{13804}Excuse me.
{13874}{13921}Boob job.
{13939}{14000}I don't want her to get a boob job.|That's crazy.
{14004}{14074}Well, it's not that crazy, okay?
{14078}{14162}Making them smaller,|that would be crazy.
{14203}{14307}Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you|about Monica's little "groomie" joke.
{14312}{14404}Well, I think the reason people laughed|is that it's a play on the word "roomie."
{14472}{14585}I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.
{14589}{14677}No, the thing I want to say is...
{14685}{14746}Maybe we should've|talked about this before.
{14751}{14853}Us living together,|you're not expecting a proposal, right?
{14858}{14925}- Oh, no, no. Not at all.|- Okay.
{14930}{15012}We're just moving in right now.|We'll see where it goes.
{15026}{15122}Yeah, well, that's the thing.|For me, it's as far as it can ever go.
{15144}{15224}- What do you mean?|- Look, Phoebe, I...
{15229}{15335}I love you very much.|But I never want to get married again.
{15400}{15494}- Wow.|- It's just, my first marriage was...
{15498}{15601}...you know, such a disaster that|I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
{15606}{15661}- Was it that bad?|- At one point, near the end...
{15665}{15769}...she deliberately defecated on my...|- Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.
{15803}{15903}But don't you think it might be|different with someone else? Perhaps...
{15907}{15972}...a blond who always|uses the toilet?
{16027}{16109}Except for once in the ocean.
{16120}{16177}Look, it's not about who I would marry.
{16181}{16265}I was certain the first time I got married|it'd last forever. I was wrong.
{16271}{16335}- But, it just...|- Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.
{16339}{16394}I just never want to get married again.
{16468}{16507}I'm sorry.
{16522}{16629}Are you okay with that? If not, maybe|us moving in together isn't the best idea.
{16643}{16717}No. Oh, I definitely don't|want to get married.
{16721}{16813}I just wanted to make sure|you didn't want to, too.
{16845}{16913}Because if we move in|and you start changing your mind...
{16917}{16962}...there is gonna be|hell to pay, mister.
{16982}{17050}- Trust me. I will never...|- Yeah, I get that. Yeah.
{17240}{17310}Hi. So you gave in|and decided to call someone?
{17315}{17418}Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.|I can barely use chopsticks.
{17434}{17495}- You're all set.|- Oh, thank you so much.
{17500}{17555}Wait. You forgot your...
{17559}{17616}...game.
{17621}{17659}Thank you.
{17720}{17833}Hey, Rach. There she is,|my perfectly proportioned wife.
{17876}{17950}Don't look at me.|I never get his jokes.
{17976}{18029}- Thank you?|- No, no. Don't thank me.
{18033}{18127}Thank you. Do you know there is not|one thing I would change about you?
{18133}{18211}Not one single thing.|And definitely not...
{18215}{18272}...two single things.
{18289}{18400}Okay, you're being weird. Do you want|sex, or did you do something bad?
{18405}{18493}No. No. No. I just love|the way you look. I am warm...
{18497}{18564}...for your form.
{18601}{18681}Okay, you know the old classics like,|you know, "You look nice"?
{18685}{18711}They're still okay.
{18722}{18798}But "you look nice" could mean|that I'm saying, "Your face looks nice."
{18802}{18863}I want to compliment your body.
{18877}{18949}I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.
{18953}{19043}And more specifically, I wouldn't|want anything to get any bigger.
{19078}{19108}- Okay.|- I mean...
{19112}{19187}...you wouldn't want any part of me|to get any bigger, would you?
{19260}{19315}Don't answer that.
{19394}{19466}Just when you thought that dude|couldn't get any weirder.
{19491}{19560}Why do you think he was so worried|about me getting bigger?
{19565}{19641}I don't know.|I mean, what brought that on?
{19646}{19715}Oh, my God. You know what,|we're trying to get pregnant...
{19719}{19799}...so he's probably starting to freak out|that my body's gonna change.
{19803}{19862}- You think that's what it is?|- You heard him.
{19867}{19937}"No bigger. You're perfect.|Just don't get any bigger."
{19941}{20047}My God, he sounded just like|my high-school wrestling coach.
{20105}{20179}- I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.|- Yeah. If you don't, I will.
{20184}{20274}Of course your body's gonna change.|Your breasts are gonna get bigger...
{20278}{20333}...your ass is gonna get bigger...
{20338}{20408}...you're gonna lose bladder control.
{20492}{20551}God, it's just such a magical time.
{20708}{20788}Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask you|something about marriage.
{20793}{20838}Now you're seeking me out|to make jokes?
{20842}{20936}I mean, I can see if we're all hanging|out, but to come to my home...
{20942}{20999}No, I really want to know|how you feel about it.
{21004}{21092}- Why?|- Mike doesn't ever want to get married.
{21110}{21157}- Never?|- Never.
{21161}{21239}Wow. Are you still gonna|move in with him?
{21249}{21358}I want to, but I wanted you to tell me|that marriage really isn't that big a deal.
{21362}{21467}You know, that I won't be missing out|on anything. That marriage stinks.
{21494}{21558}Yeah, marriage stinks.
{21579}{21684}I mean, if you want to see a man gain|weight and a woman stop shaving...
{21688}{21753}...get them married.
{21757}{21831}- That's not how you really feel, is it?|- No, I'm sorry.
{21860}{21969}I know it's not what you want to hear,|but I can't help it. I love marriage.
{21975}{22028}Seriously, you?|"Divorce-o"?
{22053}{22172}If you have to call me a name, I'd prefer|"Ross, the Divorcer." It's just cooler.
{22204}{22298}Look, I know my marriages|didn't exactly work out...
{22303}{22379}...but, you know, I loved being|that committed to another person.
{22384}{22476}And Carol and I had some good times|before she became a lesbian.
{22480}{22546}And once afterward.
{22550}{22605}Anyway, I'm sorry.
{22624}{22667}It's okay. That's how you feel.
{22703}{22768}But, come on, I mean,|living together will be great.
{22772}{22840}I mean, you guys have so much fun.|And you love Mike.
{22855}{22908}- I do love Mike.|- Yeah, see?
{22914}{22992}And you were so excited about|moving in together before...
{22997}{23056}...and you know what, you should be.|It's a big deal.
{23088}{23147}Yeah, I guess you're right.
{23151}{23202}Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.
{23208}{23269}The Divorcer to the rescue.
{23287}{23359}- It's not cooler.|- Yeah, I just heard it.
{23682}{23715}Rach?
{23918}{23979}Rachel?!
{24276}{24356}So I can't do anything I like?!
{24371}{24428}Hey, Rach.
{24432}{24522}Perfection.|Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
{24526}{24550}- Honey?|- Yeah?
{24555}{24610}About that.
{24633}{24739}- I'm going to change.|- Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.
{24744}{24793}I'm gonna get bigger.
{24799}{24832}Honey, I...
{24836}{24908}I love your breasts the way they are.
{24918}{24977}Fascist.
{24991}{25063}My breasts are gonna get bigger|whether you like it or not.
{25069}{25151}And it's not just my breasts.|My ass is gonna get bigger too.
{25157}{25218}Your ass?!
{25223}{25338}And don't be surprised if her hands|and her feet get bigger too.
{25343}{25425}- They do that?|- It's kind of a package deal.
{25460}{25538}God, why? Why would you want to|do that to yourself?
{25544}{25609}I thought it was something|that we both wanted.
{25621}{25709}If it means that much to you, I may be|able to get onboard with the boobs...
{25713}{25801}...but the giant ass|and the big clown feet?
{25826}{25867}Oh, my God, Chandler.
{25871}{25945}If you can't handle this,|what will you be like in the hospital...
{25949}{26050}...with the blood and screaming and the|little person that's shooting out of her?
{26119}{26152}What?
{26324}{26412}Joey, why did you tell Chandler|that Monica was getting a boob job?
{26422}{26481}Because she is.
{26486}{26578}- Chandler knows I borrowed the money.|- For your boob job.
{26591}{26626}- Joe...|- It's over.
{26631}{26754}Okay, so I'm out $4000 and|nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
{26857}{26968}Hey. Hey, what do you guys think|about this: Ross, the Divorce Force.
{26998}{27041}- Better.|- Yeah?
{27050}{27095}Very cool.
{27134}{27226}Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm really glad|you came to talk to me the other day...
{27230}{27303}...and I hope I was a little helpful.|- Yeah, you were helpful.
{27307}{27350}- Yeah. No, thank you.|- Good. Good.
{27355}{27435}Because the more I thought about it,|the more I realized...
{27439}{27527}...I don't think marriage is necessarily|the right path for you.
{27534}{27560}What do you mean?
{27565}{27614}I know the other day|in the coffeehouse...
{27619}{27693}...you were all caught up|in the whole soccer-mom thing...
{27698}{27799}...but is that really you? I mean, can you|honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
{27826}{27893}They are awfully boxy.
{27897}{28037}I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored|with marriage. I mean, it's so normal.
{28079}{28117}Yeah.
{28121}{28159}Hey, can I help?
{28163}{28249}Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,|maneuvered a narrow hallway...
{28253}{28357}...dodged a rabid pit bull. But these last|three feet are where it gets really tricky.
{28413}{28507}You know, sometimes your words,|they hurt.
{28538}{28597}Hey, where do you guys want this?
{28602}{28665}Yeah, seriously,|because this is really heavy.
{28669}{28775}I mean, not for me, because I'm only|pretending to hold it, but for these guys.
{28820}{28959}Just one last time on the marriage thing.|There's no wiggle room? None at all?
{28981}{29038}No, but you don't want to|get married either, right?
{29044}{29072}Right.
{29077}{29134}Except that I do want to get married.
{29139}{29213}Couldn't have had this conversation|down at the truck, huh?
{29243}{29283}What? You want to get married?
{29297}{29327}Someday.
{29332}{29410}And... hernia.
{29447}{29589}I haven't had a normal life. And I never|felt like I was missing out on anything.
{29593}{29699}But it feels like now it's my turn|to have some of the regular stuff.
{29726}{29785}Why didn't you say something before?
{29790}{29899}I didn't know how much I wanted it. And|I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
{29904}{29963}I want to live with you too.|I mean, let's do that.
{29968}{30017}But I don't think I can.
{30022}{30116}It was okay to move in when|I didn't know what was gonna happen.
{30120}{30204}But I can't move in knowing nothing|is ever gonna happen.
{30210}{30319}Can we at least try living together? You|might change your mind about marriage.
{30323}{30395}Are you gonna change yours?
{30409}{30458}No.
{30463}{30524}Me neither.
{30626}{30735}I think I need to be with someone|who wants what I want.
{30797}{30836}But I don't want this to end.
{30843}{30911}No, I don't want it to end either.
{30985}{31059}I can't believe this is gonna end.
{31121}{31176}I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.
{31199}{31246}Yeah. Okay.
{31327}{31401}Okay, so...
{31716}{31767}Goodbye.
{31796}{31886}- Take it easy, Mike.|- Bye, Mike.
{31982}{32019}I'm so sorry, Pheebs.
{32023}{32088}We're all sorry.
{32153}{32280}Look on the bright side. At least you|won't have to live with this ugly chair.
{32297}{32365}That was here already, huh?
{32371}{32428}I love you.
{32694}{32755}I did it! I did it!
{32759}{32831}All right.
{32929}{33009}I'd better take all I can carry.
{33025}{33119}Who knows when I'll be able|to get in here again, huh?

{80}{132}- You ready to go?|- Let me just finish this.
{136}{214}Hey, Ross. Check this out.
{327}{369}Yeah, I can't do that.
{403}{450}- What are you doing?|- Have you seen this?
{454}{512}It's our new alumni website|for college.
{517}{606}You can post messages for people,|let everyone know what you're up to.
{611}{716}Oh, great. A faster way to tell people|that I'm unemployed and childless.
{721}{792}It's actually interesting to find|out what people are doing.
{796}{831}Remember Andrea Rich?
{836}{887}That tall girl that wouldn't sleep|with you?
{892}{1006}Well, her Internet company went under,|and she lost an ear in a boating accident.
{1038}{1098}Bet she'd sleep with you now.
{1132}{1194}No, I already e-mailed her.
{1223}{1290}Let me see what you wrote|about yourself.
{1294}{1366}"Doctor of paleontology, two kids."
{1371}{1457}Wait a second. You split with Carol|because you had different interests?
{1461}{1568}I think you split with Carol because|you had one very similar interest.
{1595}{1664}I'm gonna finish this later, okay?|Let me just grab my coat.
{1668}{1719}Okay!
{1778}{1874}What, did you think you learned how|to do it in the last two minutes?
{1956}{2048}Maybe we finish this for him.
{2134}{2225}Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.
{2242}{2313}She is now my girlfriend.
{2336}{2467}I don't care what society says,|it's the best sex I've ever had.
{2476}{2578}- And send.|- No, no... You can't do that to him.
{2583}{2631}- All right, let's go.|- Dude!
{2635}{2743}I think you made it clear you can't be|trusted with the ball inside the house.
{2902}{2977}And send.

{3950}{4004}Hey. How was basketball?
{4009}{4078}It was fun. Right up until Chandler|got a finger in the eye.
{4082}{4127}Oh, no! Who did that?
{4132}{4188}Chandler. Yeah.
{4200}{4243}Hey!
{4265}{4294}- Rach?|- Yeah?
{4299}{4370}What's Huggsy doing|in the crib with Emma?
{4386}{4498}She was just crawling around and found|him, so I just let her sleep with him.
{4502}{4591}- That's all right, isn't it?|- Of course. Yeah.
{4595}{4721}It's a stuffed animal, you know?|It's for kids. Not for adults.
{4725}{4766}I know that.
{4771}{4840}Joey, you're sure? I mean,|I know how much you love him.
{4844}{4969}Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?|I do not love Huggsy.
{4975}{5041}I like him a normal amount.
{5072}{5131}All right.|Well, Emma loves him.
{5136}{5218}Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she?|He's a wonderful person!
{5331}{5404}- Hi.|- Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?
{5408}{5487}- You feeling better?|- Breaking up sucks.
{5491}{5583}- Oh, I really miss Mike.|- Oh, I'm so sorry.
{5588}{5679}I've tried everything to feel better.|I even tried writing a song about it...
{5683}{5758}...but I can't think of anything|that rhymes with:
{5831}{5901}Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need|your help getting through this.
{5906}{5958}You're saying you're|not gonna need my help?
{5963}{6016}No. When I get to the point|where I'm ready...
{6020}{6101}...to hear cruel, mocking jokes|about Mike, I'm gonna come to you.
{6105}{6200}Oh, good, because I've already thought|of three. Four! I just thought of a fourth!
{6225}{6285}Okay. I mean, I know|I did the right thing.
{6290}{6326}Mike never wants|to get married...
{6330}{6403}...and I shouldn't be in a relationship|that has no future.
{6407}{6463}But pretty soon,|I'm gonna miss him so much...
{6467}{6538}...I'm gonna want to see him again,|and you have to stop me.
{6543}{6597}Okay, you got it.
{6645}{6727}Unless...|Am I being too crazy about this?
{6731}{6847}All right, so there's no future. But that|doesn't mean we still can't have fun.
{6856}{6941}- You know what? Forget what I said.|- Really?
{6945}{7034}- All right, if that's what you want.|- That was a test, and you just failed.
{7059}{7131}Damn it! Rookie mistake!
{7230}{7290}I have sex with dinosaurs?
{7353}{7417}I believe I read that somewhere.
{7435}{7503}Not only is it not funny,|it's physically impossible! Okay?
{7507}{7631}Depending on the species, I'd have|to have a 6-foot-long... It's not funny!
{7662}{7722}I respectfully disagree.
{7727}{7783}I can't believe you put that|on my alumni page.
{7788}{7851}- Who cares? Nobody reads those.|- You better hope not...
{7856}{7910}...because I just read what|you put on your page.
{7915}{7995}- I don't have a page.|- Oh, I respectfully disagree!
{8431}{8527}"Look at you. All sweet and innocent",|{y:i}sleeping like an angel.
{8541}{8627}{y:i}With Emma's chubby little hands|{y:i}wrapped around you.
{8673}{8756}It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.
{8796}{8865}Step away from the crib!|I have a weapon!
{8869}{8959}It's okay! It's okay, Rach!|It's me! Put down the scrunchie.
{8978}{9046}- What are you doing?|- Well, I heard Emma stirring...
{9050}{9135}...so I came in to make sure|she could reach Huggsy.
{9149}{9248}Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that|I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
{9252}{9338}Okay, there you go, sweetie.
{9346}{9397}This isn't over!
{9504}{9578}Wait a second. Why would|Ross tell everyone in your class...
{9583}{9675}...that you are "as gay|as the day is long"?
{9698}{9774}Because I told everyone|he slept with dinosaurs.
{9789}{9905}Well, that's clearly a joke.|This could easily be true.
{9940}{10043}Would you get that, please? People have|been calling to congratulate me all day.
{10125}{10153}Hello?
{10157}{10254}No, he's not here.|Yeah, this is his wife.
{10261}{10354}Yeah. Well, it came|as quite a shock to me too!
{10382}{10494}Well, I guess I should've known. He just|kept making me watch "Moulin Rouge."
{10498}{10537}Hang up! Hang up!
{10541}{10589}And that was a great movie.
{10635}{10702}I'm so gonna get back at Ross.
{10706}{10763}Oh, yeah, this'll show him.|Here we go.
{10768}{10848}- What are you doing?|- Oh, you'll see, my friend!
{10956}{11017}I'm dead?
{11061}{11114}And so young.
{11130}{11221}Posting that I died?|That really isn't funny.
{11225}{11273}Well, how you died was funny.
{11278}{11342}Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?
{11361}{11460}It kills over one Americans|every year.
{11478}{11557}Unbelievable. My classmates|are gonna think I'm dead.
{11561}{11635}My professors. My parents|are gonna get phone calls!
{11639}{11687}You're messing with|people's feelings here.
{11692}{11778}You wanna talk about people's feelings?|You should have heard how hurt...
{11782}{11879}...Professor Stern was when I told him|I wouldn't be able to go to Key West!
{11900}{11969}You've really crossed a line here.|But that's okay.
{11973}{12040}Because I'm on my way|to buy some Photoshop software...
{12044}{12082}...and a stack of gay porn.
{12086}{12185}That's right. Your coming-out|is about to get real graphic!
{12301}{12366}God, I wish Mike were here.
{12377}{12453}Okay, if Mike were here, what|would the two of you be doing?
{12484}{12577}What are you, animals?|It's 4:00 in the afternoon.
{12585}{12669}I gotta call him. Just to talk to him.|There's no harm in that.
{12673}{12803}That's how it starts. "I don't need|to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing.
{12807}{12905}Why not just a little sliver?"|Or, "Okay, just a slice or two."
{12909}{12962}The next thing you know,|you're 210 pounds...
{12966}{13033}...and you get wedged in going|down the tunnel slide!
{13083}{13125}Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.
{13129}{13207}But look, if you talk to him,|then you're gonna want to see him.
{13211}{13277}And if you see him, you're gonna|wanna get back together.
{13281}{13347}And I know that's not what you want.
{13381}{13443}All right, so give me your phone.
{13450}{13494}Here.
{13503}{13600}- And now your cell.|- Okay.
{13696}{13753}There you go.
{13904}{13994}- This is your cell phone?|- Yes.
{13999}{14079}This is your current cell phone?
{14093}{14173}Yes. It reminds me|of a simpler time.
{14210}{14294}Phoebe? Where's your purse?
{14329}{14368}- Hey! No!|- No!
{14372}{14415}- Give it to me!|- You can't have it!
{14419}{14469}- Give it to me!|- No!
{14520}{14567}- I'll go in there!|- Oh, yeah.
{14571}{14600}- Phoebe, come here!|- No!
{14604}{14699}- Give it to me!|- You're crazy!
{14759}{14832}Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
{14897}{15022}Hey, look who's here. It's Joey.|And he brought home a friend.
{15027}{15126}Emma's right here. You promised not to|bring girls home in the middle of the day!
{15131}{15200}No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...
{15204}{15270}...a brand-new Huggsy!
{15275}{15353}Oh! Oh, that's so great!|Now Emma has two Huggsies!
{15358}{15455}No, no. Oh, no.|No, Emma has one Huggsy.
{15459}{15500}The new Huggsy.
{15504}{15590}The other Huggsy, I don't know,|I guess I'll just take him back.
{15594}{15711}You know what? When I was a little girl,|I had a little pink pony named Cotton.
{15715}{15823}Oh, I loved her so much. I took her|everywhere. I would braid her tail...
{15827}{15874}Make the transfer!
{15972}{16068}Should I be concerned that a button fell|off the old Huggsy and I can't find it?
{16073}{16167}No, don't worry about it.|I swallowed that years ago. Hey!
{16198}{16283}Oh, what? I don't think|she likes the new Huggsy.
{16289}{16356}- But he's the same.|- I think she wants the old one back.
{16361}{16433}- Yeah, but he's the same.|- Joey, come on.
{16438}{16501}But he's the same!
{16561}{16623}You're not the same.
{16714}{16774}You know, it's a lot|less surprising to do that...
{16778}{16833}...after I've buzzed you|into the building.
{16864}{16944}So, Phoebe, why are there|men's shoes by the door?
{16964}{17023}Those are my shoes.
{17027}{17102}Well, when you get over this breakup,|we need to go shopping.
{17116}{17189}Look, Monica, I really appreciate|you checking in on me.
{17193}{17252}- But I'm actually feeling a lot better.|- You are?
{17256}{17315}Yeah, I just kind of want|to be alone right now.
{17377}{17477}- Who's that?|- I ordered Chinese food.
{17530}{17603}What are the chances?!
{17610}{17702}One billion Chinese people,|and they send Mike!
{17821}{17876}- What are you doing here?|- Phoebe called me.
{17882}{17942}- Phoebe!|- I'm sorry. I broke down.
{17946}{17977}I wanted to see him.
{17981}{18032}Damn it, Phoebe,|how did you even call him?
{18037}{18091}There's a speakerphone|on the base unit.
{18096}{18177}Base unit. Think, Monica, think!
{18183}{18261}- Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she...|- This doesn't concern you!
{18296}{18377}Sorry. I guess I was thrown off|by the mention of my name.
{18419}{18472}Look, guys, you can't do this.
{18476}{18534}It's gonna make getting|over each other harder.
{18539}{18637}Not if nothing happens.|Why can't we just hang out as friends?
{18674}{18764}Sure. If you're just gonna hang out|as friends, then maybe I'll join you.
{18769}{18835}You know, I'm your friend|and Mike's friend.
{18912}{18963}Sit down.
{19053}{19102}Make room for your friend.
{19343}{19411}- So how have you been?|- I've been pretty good.
{19526}{19621}- You look really beautiful.|- Thanks. You look good too.
{19625}{19739}No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.|Keep it clean.
{19769}{19808}So how's the piano playing going?
{19813}{19893}Actually, I've been playing a lot|of love songs lately.
{19897}{19990}- I've missed you.|- I've missed you too.
{20055}{20176}You know, on the way over here,|I saw this drunk guy throw up.
{20206}{20273}And then a pigeon ate it.
{20368}{20406}Hey. Ross.
{20414}{20487}Look, I just wanted to apologize.
{20491}{20586}Don't tell me you actually made|those gay pictures of me.
{20603}{20644}Check this out.
{20649}{20728}So that's what I'd look like|if I worked out.
{20744}{20830}And was being serviced|by a policeman.
{20834}{20886}You're not gonna actually|send these out, are you?
{20891}{20986}Actually, I don't need to, because your|little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work.
{20990}{21032}Okay? There were no responses.
{21036}{21147}Nobody posted anything, nobody called|my parents, so the joke is on you.
{21151}{21272}Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,|nobody cares that I'm dead.
{21365}{21406}Oh, my God.
{21411}{21498}- Nobody cares that I'm dead?|- Oh, come on, you know that's not true.
{21502}{21560}What are you talking about?|You get 60 responses...
{21564}{21605}...just for coming|out of the closet.
{21609}{21688}I didn't get one response,|and I'm dead!
{21692}{21798}Well, the gay community is a lot more|vocal than the dead community.
{21802}{21944}I can't believe this. Not even my geology|lab partner. And I carried that guy!
{21950}{21994}Look, let's think about this, okay?
{21998}{22075}You think people are gonna disturb|your family at this tragic time?
{22080}{22145}That people are gonna post condolences|on a website?
{22149}{22192}This isn't about people not caring.
{22196}{22316}This is about people not having|a decent outlet for their grief.
{22320}{22385}- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.|- Right.
{22390}{22502}I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial|service, tons of people would come.
{22516}{22573}Exactly!
{22592}{22650}Ross, what are you doing?
{22654}{22710}You're having a memorial service|for yourself?
{22719}{22819}No, that would be stupid.|You're having it for me.
{22825}{22925}- Ross, don't press send. Don't press...|- No, too late. Too late. It's sent.
{22929}{23007}Sorry, so is that picture|of you and the policeman.
{23054}{23122}I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.|Have you seen Huggsy?
{23127}{23173}Original or crappy?
{23205}{23266}- Original.|- No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.
{23271}{23347}Then what's that big lump|under your covers?
{23366}{23447}- It's Monica, okay?|- That's not Monica!
{23451}{23532}All right, fine!|It's original Huggsy!
{23571}{23632}I know Emma wants him,|but he's mine and I need him.
{23636}{23701}She's being unreasonable.
{23706}{23788}Joey, there is a reason that Emma|loves that stupid penguin so much!
{23793}{23843}Oh, don't cover its ears!
{23860}{23950}It's because it reminds her|of her Uncle Joey.
{23971}{24012}- It does?|- Yeah.
{24016}{24133}And she's comforted by him because|she loves her Uncle Joey so much.
{24138}{24230}- Really? She loves me?|- Oh, yeah.
{24235}{24306}But you know what?|If you need Huggsy, don't worry.
{24310}{24387}Emma will totally understand.|I won't, but whatever.
{24392}{24501}Okay, wait a minute, Rach.|I mean, if...
{24505}{24592}If Huggsy means that much|to Emma, then...
{24602}{24632}Well, she can have him.
{24642}{24707}Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey|would step up.
{24716}{24807}- Look, Emma. Look who's back.|- No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!
{24812}{24881}Are you...? You're gonna take|Huggsy away from a little child?
{24886}{24943}How do you think I got him|in the first place?
{25005}{25061}All right, you two.|I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
{25065}{25115}I don't want anything going|on while I'm gone.
{25121}{25168}Here's a few things you can discuss:
{25172}{25274}Mucus, fungus, and the idea|of me and Ross doing it.
{25359}{25393}I've missed you so much.
{25398}{25490}I won't ask you to get back together.|I know we want different things, but...
{25494}{25556}- Just to be with you one more night.|- I want that too.
{25560}{25660}- But is that gonna make it too hard?|- It can't be any harder than this.
{25665}{25764}I mean, if I had known the last time|I saw you would be the last time, l...
{25768}{25840}I would have stopped to memorize|your face, the way you moved.
{25844}{25897}Everything about you.
{25901}{25999}If I had known the last time I kissed|you would be the last time...
{26003}{26062}...I never would have stopped.
{26093}{26154}Kiss him, you fool!
{26170}{26228}- What?|- Didn't you hear that speech?
{26232}{26286}If you don't kiss him,|then I will.
{26304}{26366}I missed you so much.
{26380}{26467}- I knew you'd be here!|- Crap.
{26471}{26563}- Who is this?|- My friend Manny.
{26567}{26639}I asked him to keep me|away from you.
{26654}{26759}- Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.|- Well, you're not doing a very good job.
{26773}{26824}- Excuse me?|- What's with the kissing?
{26829}{26890}Hey, at least I knew|where my guy was.
{26894}{26970}Yeah, thank God you were here|to oversee all the kissing.
{26994}{27058}- You didn't hear the speech.|- I've heard the speech.
{27063}{27116}If he knew it was gonna|be the last time...
{27120}{27177}Hey, it was very moving.|You're just heartless!
{27182}{27239}- You're weak!|- You're weird!
{27244}{27307}Your pants are undone.
{27372}{27423}Where'd they go?
{27444}{27526}- Damn it.|- Well, we blew it.
{27530}{27582}I blame myself.
{27592}{27640}And I blame you too.
{27794}{27883}It's been an hour, and not one|of my classmates has shown up?
{27888}{28003}I tell you, when I actually die, some|people are gonna get seriously haunted.
{28042}{28089}There you go. Someone came.
{28094}{28147}Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.
{28151}{28234}This is so exciting.|My first mourner!
{28308}{28364}Hi. Glad you could come.
{28368}{28455}- Please come in.|- Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?
{28459}{28565}- I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.|- Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.
{28569}{28658}Thanks. I'm so sorry|about Ross, it's...
{28662}{28726}No, at least he died doing|what he loved.
{28730}{28785}Watching blimps.
{28914}{28974}- Who is it?|- You know some guy, Tom Gordon?
{28980}{29013}I don't remember him.
{29017}{29106}But then again,|I touched so many lives.
{29161}{29198}So did you know Ross well?
{29202}{29278}Actually, I barely knew him.|I came because I heard Chandler's news.
{29282}{29345}Do you know if he's seeing anyone?
{29432}{29554}- Yes, he is. Me.|- What? You mean...?
{29609}{29724}Can I ask you a personal question?|How do you shave your beard so close?
{29753}{29808}Okay, Tommy!|That's enough mourning for you.
{29812}{29893}Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.
{29897}{29988}- Hey, listen. Call me.|- Okay.
{30043}{30159}- I'm dead and no one cares?|- I look like a man?
{30170}{30240}Please, one ridiculous problem|at a time.
{30244}{30311}This isn't ridiculous.|Look around, no one's here.
{30316}{30405}You gave them one day's notice. Not|everyone checks the website every day.
{30409}{30493}And Monica, it's probably|the way you stand!
{30522}{30602}I guess you're right.|Still, somebody must have seen it.
{30606}{30703}I went to that school for four years|and I didn't have an impact on anyone?
{30707}{30786}Well, that's not true.|You had an impact on me.
{30790}{30855}I mean, it's 15 years later|and we're still best friends.
{30859}{30924}Doesn't that count for something?
{31019}{31099}Oh, great, more party boys|for Chandler.
{31105}{31194}I'm sure it's somebody for you.|Now go hide.
{31283}{31370}Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's|memorial service.
{31389}{31475}- Kori? Kori Weston?|- Yeah.
{31487}{31553}- You look amazing.|- And you are?
{31558}{31643}Chandler. Chandler Bing.|And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.
{31647}{31695}You are married, though.
{31699}{31776}Don't listen to him.|He's in a really bad mood.
{31860}{31946}I can't believe that Ross is gone.|It is just so sad.
{31951}{32000}I didn't know Ross and you|were so close.
{32005}{32097}Oh, we weren't. But we had one class|together. He was such a great guy.
{32101}{32187}And he talked so passionately|about science.
{32191}{32278}- I always remembered him.|- I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
{32282}{32325}And if heaven has a door...
{32329}{32420}...I'm sure he's pressing his ear|up against it and listening intently.
{32464}{32560}I thought so many times about|calling him and asking him out.
{32564}{32609}I guess I really missed my chance.
{32619}{32674}No, you didn't!
{32717}{32780}I'm still alive!
{32790}{32850}Kori, I know this|is a big surprise for you.
{32855}{32954}It's a long story. But the things you|just said really made my day.
{32958}{33010}The fact that you're here|means more to me...
{33014}{33079}...than if this room were filled|with people.
{33095}{33155}You sick freak! Who does that?
{33159}{33226}I can't believe I had a crush on you.
{33329}{33372}Did you hear that?
{33376}{33465}Kori Weston had a crush on me!
{33642}{33724}No, Mom, I am not dead.
{33735}{33813}I know it's not something|to kid about.
{33830}{33935}It was just a practical joke between|Chandler and me, but it's over, okay?
{33947}{34061}Actually, no. Even if I had died,|you would not be left childless.
{34093}{34144}Monica?

{180}{250}Monica?|Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
{255}{296}- Okay.|- All right!
{301}{357}But what is it not?
{373}{445}A place to entertain my lady friends.
{459}{566}- And what else is it not?|- A place to eat spaghetti.
{583}{633}Very good. What do you need|it for anyway?
{639}{697}The Powerball lottery|is up to 300 million...
{703}{810}...and they don't sell tickets here.|- So you're driving up to Connecticut?
{814}{890}Yeah, Connecticut.|Not West Virginia.
{929}{1006}Maybe I'll drive you up there.|I'd like to buy some tickets myself.
{1016}{1117}Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid,|we could really use $300 million.
{1121}{1238}Yes, because if I was at my old job,|we'd say, "300 million? No, thank you."
{1283}{1332}- Will you get me tickets too?|- Yeah, me too.
{1337}{1378}- Sure.|- I have an idea.
{1382}{1460}Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks,|we'll pool our money together...
{1464}{1552}...and then if we win, we'll split it.|- That's a great idea!
{1566}{1621}No, thanks.
{1639}{1693}- You don't want to win the lottery?|- Sure I do.
{1698}{1746}I also want to be king|of my own country...
{1750}{1816}...and find out what happened|to Amelia Earhart.
{1831}{1906}- Still on Amelia Earhart?|- The woman just vanished!
{1948}{1991}Seriously, you don't want in on this?
{1996}{2066}No. Do you know what your odds|are of winning the lottery?
{2070}{2156}I mean, you have a better chance|of being struck by lightning 42 times.
{2162}{2238}But there's six of us, so we'd|only have to get struck 7 times.
{2243}{2294}I like those odds!
{2314}{2407}Seriously, you guys, I can't believe|you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.
{2412}{2490}I mean, that's such a bunch|of boo-hockey.
{2570}{2615}I'll ask.
{2634}{2669}"Boo-hockey"?
{2693}{2744}Oh, we think Emma's about|to start talking...
{2749}{2835}...so we're trying to be careful about|what words we use in front of her.
{2841}{2892}So get ready to hear a lot|of boo-hockey...
{2897}{2958}...gosh darn it|and brother pucker.
{2999}{3046}How do you know|she's gonna start talking?
{3051}{3143}When I talk to her, I almost feel|like she understands what I'm saying.
{3147}{3192}Kind of like Joey.

{4541}{4627}God, look at all these tickets.|It's so exciting.
{4633}{4680}I haven't won anything|since sixth grade.
{4685}{4739}Pie-eating contest?
{4784}{4867}You assume because I was heavy that's|the only way I could win something?
{4873}{4945}No, I saw a picture|of you covered in blueberries.
{4950}{5018}- That was a good day.|- Yeah.
{5032}{5126}- They're towing your car!|- I'm parked in a garage on Morton.
{5147}{5208}They're towing a car.
{5213}{5301}And I am seeing spots.
{5307}{5371}Ross, you don't have Emma!|Rachel, you don't have Emma!
{5375}{5432}- Where's Emma? Who has Emma?|- Joey, relax.
{5437}{5540}My mother picked her up two hours ago.|You were there.
{5564}{5630}- I was?|- Yes, and you talked to her.
{5641}{5715}- I did?|- She dropped off a casserole.
{5720}{5790}Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.
{5798}{5852}Did you come by to watch|us win the big bucks?
{5858}{5943}Yeah. And then I figured after you win,|we can all go out to the balcony...
{5947}{6054}...and see a night rainbow|with gremlins dancing on top of it.
{6080}{6136}Don't touch the phone!|I'll get it!
{6148}{6210}- You think he washed his hands?|- Hello?
{6216}{6271}- Hey, Charlie, what do you know?|- What's going on?
{6277}{6354}Chandler's supposed to find out if he's|getting a job at his agency.
{6358}{6415}But out of 15 interns,|they're only hiring three.
{6421}{6464}- Tough odds.|- Yeah.
{6469}{6558}If only it were a sure thing|like your 24-state lottery.
{6584}{6674}Yeah, look who's coming around!
{6680}{6768}Damn it. All right, call me|when you know more.
{6801}{6869}- Did you get it?|- One of the slots got filled.
{6882}{6987}- By you?|- Sense the tone.
{7019}{7103}- No, that kid Nate got it.|- Oh, I hate that guy.
{7108}{7186}I mean, come on, kid,|pull up your pants!
{7190}{7234}Well, there's two spots left, right?
{7240}{7302}Yeah. I mean, I want this so much.|I want to get one.
{7307}{7359}I want my friend Charlie|to get one.
{7364}{7413}Except I don't care about Charlie.
{7459}{7484}- Hey, you guys.|- Hey!
{7489}{7555}You are not gonna believe this.|I just saw my psychic...
{7559}{7651}...and she said I was definitely|gonna win the lottery tonight!
{7685}{7734}I thought we could use|some extra luck...
{7739}{7787}...so I brought a wishbone home|from work.
{7793}{7947}A psychic and a wishbone?|Guys, give someone else a chance.
{7960}{8008}- All right, who wants to do it?|- Can I?
{8014}{8084}Vegetarians never get|to do the wishbone.
{8089}{8157}It's really not fair. Just because|we don't eat the meat...
{8161}{8235}...doesn't mean we don't like|to play with the carcasses.
{8250}{8291}All right. Rach?
{8296}{8352}I don't want that turkey smell|all over my hands.
{8358}{8442}I'll do it! Lt'll get the casserole|stink off of mine.
{8502}{8564}- I hope I win.|- Well, it doesn't really matter.
{8569}{8616}You're both wishing|for the same thing.
{8621}{8734}I can't tell you what I'm wishing for,|or else, you know, it won't come true.
{8743}{8813}Right. But we know|what you're wishing for.
{8818}{8888}- I can't really say.|- I understand.
{8893}{8953}But you're wishing|for what we think, aren't you?
{8959}{9025}I'm not really comfortable|with these questions!
{9029}{9078}- Please!|- Just do it!
{9084}{9130}Okay. One, two, three.
{9135}{9180}I won! Hey!
{9185}{9259}You know what? I'm sure your|wish is gonna come true.
{9264}{9380}But, you guys, just in case, maybe a|genie will come out if we rub this lamp.
{9412}{9460}That thing gets hot!
{9465}{9504}Ross, just keep making your jokes.
{9509}{9561}How are you gonna feel|if we actually do win?
{9567}{9642}- You're not gonna win.|- I know the odds are against us...
{9647}{9746}...but somebody has to win, and it could|be us. And then how you gonna feel?
{9751}{9840}We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let's|take our helicopters up to the Cape."
{9845}{9901}And you're gonna be all,|like, "Oh, I can't, guys.
{9906}{9982}I'll have to meet you up there.|I gotta gas up the Hyundai."
{10082}{10179}Okay, I've heard myself on tape,|and I sound nothing like that.
{10198}{10260}I can see the headline now:|"Lottery Winners' Friend...
{10264}{10321}...Filled With Regret,|Eats Own Arm."
{10339}{10374}Why would I eat my own arm?
{10379}{10464}Well, you wouldn't, but we own the|paper. We can print whatever we want.
{10469}{10531}You know what? I'm gonna|throw in 50 bucks for you.
{10548}{10594}- Why?|- Because I know that you think...
{10598}{10672}...that the lottery is boo-hockey...
{10681}{10765}...but we're all here, and we're gonna|watch the numbers and have fun.
{10770}{10865}And you're my brother,|and I want you to be a part of this.
{10883}{10971}You don't have to do that.|I mean, I'll pay for myself.
{10976}{11069}But just the fact that you want me to|have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.
{11073}{11112}Come here.
{11137}{11195}Get a room.
{11276}{11340}So now that you're in,|what are you gonna do if we win?
{11345}{11456}- I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.|- Calm down.
{11460}{11526}Seriously, that's your fantasy?|To invest it?
{11532}{11644}Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, "invest it"?|I meant, "Be cool and piss it all away."
{11700}{11786}I know! We should pool all|our money and buy the Knicks!
{11795}{11840}I don't really care about the Knicks.
{11845}{11915}You will when I pick you|as starting forward.
{11925}{12020}You would do that?|I never get picked!
{12037}{12082}I'm not sure a sports team|is the way to go.
{12086}{12164}You won't let me buy the Knicks?|I can't believe you're taking this away.
{12173}{12267}You're right, it has been your dream|for over 15 seconds.
{12287}{12369}How long until they announce|the numbers, Mommy?
{12382}{12479}I'll take this one too.|"Mommy"?
{12495}{12555}Oh, I've gotten into the habit|of calling Rachel...
{12560}{12609}..."Mommy" when we're around Emma.
{12614}{12706}Which I now realize we are not.
{12734}{12815}I'm hoping that if she hears it enough,|it'll be her first word.
{12821}{12920}Although if we're gonna do that,|we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
{12933}{12992}I like that, Daddy.
{13082}{13150}I was just talking about Rachel.
{13156}{13224}Is Daddy getting angry?
{13270}{13334}Is Daddy gonna spank me?
{13380}{13433}Well, that depends.
{13438}{13504}Have you been a bad...?|No, I can't.
{13587}{13688}Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.|Did anybody else hear?
{13712}{13772}What? Susan got it? How?
{13777}{13851}Oh, man, I would've slept with him!
{13870}{13918}All right, bye.
{13933}{13995}Dude, I'm sorry.|But hey, there's one spot left, right?
{14000}{14064}- Well, Charlie's gonna get that.|- Hey, don't say that.
{14069}{14133}You've got just as good a chance|of getting that job.
{14138}{14177}He is the boss' son.
{14191}{14251}- Come on, lottery!|- Yeah!
{14256}{14320}- It starts in, like, 20 minutes.|- Okay, here we go.
{14325}{14405}We need to sort through the tickets|quickly to see if we've won.
{14410}{14474}So does anybody have any ideas|how to organize this?
{14479}{14530}Okay, how about this:
{14550}{14598}We divide them|into six groups of 40.
{14603}{14675}The remaining 10 can be read|by whoever finishes first.
{14681}{14747}- I have another idea.|- I'm sorry, idea time is over.
{14797}{14855}- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?|- Yeah.
{14861}{14943}- What about the ones on the nightstand?|- There are no tickets there.
{14949}{15015}Yes, there are.|I just saw them a few minutes ago.
{15034}{15100}No, you didn't.|You must be mistaken.
{15105}{15195}- There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.|- Chandler, sense the tone.
{15236}{15337}Well, well, well.|Look what Mommy found.
{15360}{15440}Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra|tickets for me and Chandler.
{15461}{15535}The psychic also said that|I would be betrayed.
{15576}{15644}I can't believe this.|I thought we were all in this together.
{15650}{15730}- Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!|- Three minutes ago!
{15734}{15794}I don't know why that's important.
{15800}{15899}I was with you the whole time.|When did you even get those?
{15904}{16011}When you were reading the dirty|magazines without taking off the plastic.
{16020}{16061}I'll show you how.
{16085}{16163}Okay. Well, Monica, suppose one|of your special tickets wins?
{16168}{16236}How are you gonna feel when you win|and lose your friends?
{16241}{16331}Please. If I win the lottery,|you guys are not gonna leave me.
{16336}{16435}Someone gave me muffins last week, and|I couldn't get rid of you for three days!
{16462}{16538}Chandler, would you just tell her|what she did was wrong?
{16544}{16612}She's right. You shouldn't have|bought tickets just for us.
{16618}{16657}Let me finish.
{16661}{16725}However, it doesn't look like|I'm gonna get this job...
{16728}{16831}...so I can't afford to have principles.|So screw you! The tickets are ours!
{16855}{16916}There's the man I married.
{16923}{16977}All right. Believe me,|if you win the lottery...
{16982}{17029}...it's the last you're gonna hear|from us.
{17035}{17147}Fine. Don't be my friends.|I'll buy new friends.
{17154}{17271}Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic|surgery so they look just like you!
{17276}{17340}You know what?|I want my share of the tickets.
{17343}{17402}I want my tickets too!|And I'm buying the Knicks!
{17407}{17465}And Steffi Graf!
{17470}{17526}Cool. Then I want mine too!|And if I win...
{17531}{17606}...I'm gonna put it all|into a very low-yield bond!
{17612}{17715}No. You guys, we gotta keep|all the tickets together.
{17720}{17768}No. No, we should divide them up...
{17773}{17830}...and I should get extra because|we used my car!
{17836}{17900}Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,|it should be me!
{17905}{18016}- This whole thing was my idea!|- Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!
{18042}{18100}Just give them to me,|and I'll split them up!
{18158}{18206}Hey, hey!
{18223}{18295}God, I can't take it anymore!|I'm putting an end to this!
{18301}{18380}- Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!|- Wait, no, no! Hey!
{18424}{18496}If we're not doing this together,|we're not doing it at all.
{18500}{18555}- Say goodbye to your tickets.|- No! No! No!
{18561}{18622}Do not come any closer!
{18627}{18715}Can I come a little bit closer?|Valuable things are getting squished.
{18721}{18785}Now, what's more important,|your friends or money?
{18790}{18846}- Friends!|- Money!
{18927}{18964}Friends.
{18985}{19042}Hey, Monica,|what about your extra tickets?
{19048}{19095}They're all in there.
{19114}{19194}- Even these five that I hid in my bra.|- Monica!
{19198}{19266}Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.
{19270}{19338}There is no way I was|gonna dump this...
{19342}{19397}God! No!
{19469}{19533}I think I broke your bowl.
{19540}{19604}Go! Go! Go!
{19941}{20044}What a beautiful night to be running|around the street, looking for tickets.
{20063}{20115}And the wind sure made it fun.
{20136}{20193}- Phoebe, we lost half of them.|- So what?
{20198}{20249}Monica, we have the winning ticket.
{20254}{20336}My psychic said I was|gonna win, remember?
{20341}{20450}Weird your psychic didn't mention|anything about the scary pigeon.
{20467}{20553}As a matter of fact, she said|that's how I'm going to die.
{20558}{20661}So excuse me|for being a little skittish.
{20665}{20716}There's two messages.|This could be from work.
{20721}{20809}- Oh, play them.|- Okay. Here we go.
{20835}{20974}{y:i}Hello. This is the pigeon from|{y:i}the balcony calling to apologize.
{20986}{21116}{y:i}I shouldn't have knocked the tickets|{y:i}out of the pretty lady's hand.
{21133}{21242}{y:i}It was all my fault.|{y:i}Not hers. Bye.
{21381}{21457}Well, I bet that was very hard|for him to do.
{21508}{21547}"Hey", "Chandler", "it's Charlie."
{21552}{21596}This is it.
{21601}{21700}"Listen", "it turns"|{y:i}out I got the last spot.
{21705}{21773}"I'm really sorry", "man."|{y:i}It was a lot of fun working with you.
{21777}{21835}{y:i}Give me a call if you want.
{21840}{21906}Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.
{21910}{21947}Sorry, Chandler.
{21951}{22068}It is so unfair. It's like that time they|promoted Saundra over me at work.
{22074}{22115}Was she related to Ralph Lauren?
{22120}{22207}No, she was just much better|at her job than me.
{22214}{22270}You guys, the drawing's|about to start.
{22274}{22333}We should call my mom's|and say good night to Emma...
{22337}{22385}...before she goes down.|- Good idea.
{22398}{22464}Honey, you're being really strong|about this.
{22469}{22529}I know how badly you wanted that job.
{22535}{22601}Yeah, you know, I really|thought I deserved it.
{22609}{22735}But let's go win the lottery. I mean, we|still have a 130 chances to win, right?
{22775}{22832}Hundred and thirty-one.
{22855}{22919}Yeah, good night, sweetheart.|I love you.
{22924}{23015}And remember,|you're Daddy's little girl.
{23020}{23092}Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.
{23171}{23206}Hi, Mom. Put her back on.
{23211}{23258}Rach, they're announcing|the numbers!
{23277}{23359}My God, I can already feel|myself changing.
{23370}{23462}{y:i}Here are your official Powerball|{y:i}numbers. We have 53.
{23468}{23527}- I've got that.|- We have one too!
{23532}{23598}We are on the road, people!
{23631}{23655}Come on!
{23661}{23791}Mom, please, I know you love your new|lips, but I can barely understand you.
{23796}{23870}Would you please just let me|say good night to my daughter?
{23876}{23932}{y:i}And here we go.|{y:i}The Powerball is seven.
{23938}{24026}All right, check your numbers!|Make me rich.
{24062}{24109}You guys,|you're not gonna believe this.
{24114}{24194}I was just saying good night|to Emma, and she said her first words.
{24205}{24250}- What?|- Well, what did she say?
{24255}{24323}She said, "Gleba"!
{24415}{24468}Make me rich!
{24484}{24564}- Isn't that amazing?|- Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.
{24569}{24610}Why aren't you more excited?
{24628}{24716}Rach, gleba is not a word.
{24727}{24822}- Well, of course it is.|- Okay. What does it mean?
{24828}{24900}Well, I don't know all the words.
{24910}{24993}You know, I'm just glad I didn't|miss my daughter's first word.
{24998}{25101}- Yes you did! Gleba is a word!|- Okay. Use it in a sentence.
{25107}{25197}Okay. Emma just said, "Gleba."
{25271}{25366}- It's not a word.|- Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.
{25371}{25408}Okay, great.
{25413}{25487}While you're at it,|she said another word the other day.
{25491}{25539}Why don't you look up:
{25643}{25748}All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba.|Gleba. Gleba. Gleba!
{25753}{25881}Here it is! "The fleshy, spore-bearing|inner mass of a certain fungi."
{25997}{26081}She's gonna be a scientist.
{26256}{26316}- Damn it. Anybody got anything?|- No.
{26333}{26372}I'm still looking through mine.
{26378}{26454}Just double-checking.|No.
{26458}{26528}No. No.
{26644}{26692}No!
{26770}{26836}Hello? Hold on.
{26841}{26870}It's your boss.
{26875}{26936}The "I'm sorry I rejected you"|phone call.
{26941}{27003}I'm not used to getting these|from guys.
{27029}{27088}- Hey, Steve.|- Chandler, hi.
{27093}{27163}I'm sure you've heard|we filled the three positions.
{27167}{27222}We felt that with your|maturity and experience...
{27227}{27285}...you wouldn't be happy|being someone's assistant.
{27291}{27353}I'd love to be somebody's|assistant. Answering phones...
{27357}{27400}...getting coffee,|I live for that stuff.
{27405}{27522}And I'm not too mature.|Farts, boobies, butt cracks!
{27572}{27650}Chandler, you were the strongest|person in the program.
{27655}{27737}We're offering you the position|of junior copywriter.
{27779}{27845}Me? That guy|who just said, "butt cracks"?
{27849}{27877}"Yes", "that's right."
{27883}{27939}We're excited about the level|of sophistication...
{27943}{27998}...you'll be bringing to the job.
{28033}{28120}Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it.|I'll see you tomorrow.
{28420}{28459}What?
{28464}{28530}Oh, yeah, I'm gonna|be a junior copywriter!
{28561}{28631}Congratulations!|Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.
{28636}{28698}Thanks. Does that mean|I get the good loving tonight?
{28703}{28794}You bet. No TV or anything.
{28811}{28890}- Hey, that is so great about the job.|- Thanks, man.
{28895}{28946}I'd like to think I had|something to do with it.
{28952}{29028}- Really? Why?|- Well, before with the wishbone.
{29033}{29171}I didn't wish we would win the lottery.|I wished you'd get the job.
{29182}{29230}Oh, yeah?
{29241}{29322}Listen, don't tell Monica.|She'll rip your heart right out.
{29387}{29446}Well, you know what?|There was a little part of me...
{29451}{29500}...that really thought|we were gonna win.
{29506}{29660}Me too. So much for my|dinosaur/ Amelia Earhart theme park.
{29688}{29770}You guys? What was the Powerball|number again?
{29775}{29836}- Seven.|- We won.
{29844}{29887}- What?|- We won!
{29891}{29955}- Let me see! Let me see!|- Don't tear it!
{29965}{30055}Phoebe, you don't have any|of the first five numbers!
{30082}{30231}I know that, but look, we got|the Powerball number. We won $3!
{30253}{30350}Wow, you think we should get that over|20 years or go for the big payout?
{30355}{30466}I don't care. I've never won|anything before. I can't believe this!
{30471}{30524}So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do|with your $3?
{30530}{30631}Well, it's not all mine.|We all get 50 cents.
{30642}{30692}You know what?|You can have mine.
{30697}{30726}- Me too.|- Me too.
{30731}{30784}Me too.
{30900}{30968}Well, I guess if everybody else is.
{31202}{31272}Hey, guys. So I just called|the Powerball hot line.
{31281}{31403}- Can you believe it? Nobody won.|- I beg to differ.
{31440}{31526}Maybe nobody won the jackpot,|but there was this guy in here earlier...
{31531}{31648}...and he found a ticket on the street|right outside and won $ 10,000.
{31892}{31999}Again, don't blame the pretty lady.
{32009}{32127}It was not her fault.|It was me, the pigeon.
{32213}{32291}Seriously, stop staring at her.

{215}{311}You know you want it to happen|as much as I do.
{315}{413}I want you. I need you.
{472}{533}Let me make love to you.
{537}{605}I don't wanna stand in the way|of true love or anything...
{609}{689}...but I think a cantaloupe|might hurt less.
{693}{750}No, I'm rehearsing my lines.
{755}{822}They're giving me a romantic story|on "Days of our Lives".
{827}{915}It's the first time my character's got|one. I'm nervous. I want it to be good.
{920}{1027}I haven't seen you this worked-up since|you did that dog-food commercial...
{1032}{1133}...and you thought you were gonna be|with a real talking dog.
{1137}{1198}Yeah, that was a disappointment.
{1203}{1297}You wanna come down to the set|and tell me if I'm doing okay?
{1302}{1340}- Are you serious?|- Yeah.
{1345}{1412}You just have to promise not|to get thrown out again.

{1713}{1789}Yeah, that was an awesome day.

{2772}{2854}You guys wanna come eat dinner|at the restaurant in the next few weeks?
{2860}{2925}- I'd love to.|- Well, you can't.
{2957}{3041}- We're booked solid for the next month.|- Well, I can't give you a massage...
{3046}{3128}...because my license|has been revoked again.
{3133}{3219}- Phoebe, what happened?|- Well, it was an accident, you know.
{3223}{3305}It's a lot of oil and sometimes|the hand just slips.
{3348}{3415}Have I got a surprise for you.|Pack your bags.
{3419}{3524}Oh, no. You guys aren't supposed|to get divorced for seven years.
{3563}{3641}What? No, I'm taking Monica|to a romantic inn in Vermont.
{3645}{3779}Oh, good. Okay, good for you.|Trying to recapture the magic.
{3812}{3867}- So can you get out of work?|- Honey, I can't.
{3872}{3962}- Things are crazy at the restaurant.|- You're really that busy?
{3967}{4031}Yeah. I'm sorry, I really am.
{4035}{4115}That's okay. I'll just try and reschedule.
{4150}{4205}Hi, this is Chandler Bing.|I made a reservation there...
{4209}{4272}...and I need to change it.
{4291}{4388}What do you mean it's nonrefundable?|Well, can I just come some other time?
{4415}{4452}Can't you make an exception?
{4458}{4524}Tell them I'm a chef|at a big New York restaurant.
{4530}{4635}Tell them that in two weeks, I will once|again be a masseuse in good standing.
{4669}{4757}Look, this is ridiculous.|I'm not paying for that room, okay?
{4761}{4830}Well, thank you very much.
{4840}{4906}Yeah, I'm going to Vermont.
{4910}{5004}- Don't worry, use your travel insurance.|- I don't have travel insurance.
{5009}{5114}Well, this is what happens|when people live on the edge.
{5120}{5173}Why don't you take Ross?
{5177}{5278}Don't you think that'll be a little weird?|I mean, two guys in a romantic inn?
{5285}{5375}- No, not if the room has two beds.|- I guess.
{5380}{5474}It still seems a little...|"Moonlight boat ride"?!
{5589}{5660}Joey, is this the bed|where Olivia lost her virginity?
{5665}{5730}I don't know,|but one of the extras sure did.
{5734}{5816}Listen, Rach. Thanks again|for coming down to watch my scenes.
{5822}{5906}Please, honey. Just the fact that you|want me here to support you, I'm...
{5910}{6025}Oh, my God. Is that Christian Saunders?|He is so gorgeous!
{6031}{6095}And also, so gay.
{6099}{6193}Well, in my head,|he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.
{6198}{6303}Well, at the Christmas party, him|and Santa did some definitely-gay stuff.
{6307}{6360}Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.
{6364}{6413}Okay. All right, wish me luck.
{6417}{6505}Okay. Not that you need it, but good...|God! Is that Chase Lassiter?
{6514}{6588}- He's straight, right?|- Rach, if you weren't here wondering...
{6592}{6676}...if these guys were gay,|I don't know if I could do this.
{6682}{6756}I'm sorry, you're right.|I'm sorry. Good luck.
{6761}{6845}On a bell, please. Quietly.
{6849}{6892}And action!
{6922}{6971}Drake, what are you doing here?
{6976}{7021}Stopping you from marrying|the wrong man...
{7025}{7074}...and making the biggest|mistake of your life.
{7080}{7131}- Get out.|- You don't love him.
{7136}{7173}What do you know about love?
{7178}{7244}I know what I felt that night|when we kissed under the bridge.
{7249}{7337}- That kiss never happened.|- Well, what about this one?
{7387}{7454}Now, I told you to get out.
{7458}{7505}Fine, I'll go.
{7527}{7570}But let me ask you one question.
{7575}{7676}- You look real familiar. Have we...?|- Shh! He's asking her a question.
{7699}{7795}Can you live the rest of your life never|knowing what we could have been?
{7800}{7870}- I don't have a choice.|- Yes, you do.
{7875}{7984}Yes, you do. I'm the one who doesn't|have a choice because I...
{7989}{8063}Because I can't stop loving you.
{8067}{8159}- Don't say that.|- Tell me to stop.
{8167}{8216}Just...
{8229}{8303}...tell me to stop.
{8309}{8375}- Cut!|- No!
{8402}{8486}Or, cut. You know, that's your call.
{8531}{8578}- Everything was delicious.|- Thank you.
{8583}{8644}It was. The duck in particular|was superb.
{8648}{8703}Thank you.
{8769}{8824}You haven't said anything.
{8830}{8889}Actually, I do have one small complaint.
{8894}{9005}Well, please, I welcome criticism.
{9021}{9099}The musician right outside the restaurant|is kind of a mood killer.
{9105}{9131}What musician?
{9610}{9643}What are you doing here?
{9649}{9745}You said you had customers lined up|in the street, so I'm here to entertain.
{9749}{9816}- Great.|- Yeah, it really has been great too.
{9821}{9866}They must have seen me|play before...
{9871}{9930}...because they requested|a bunch of my songs.
{9934}{9991}Yeah, "You Suck"...
{9995}{10040}...and "Shut Up and Go Home."
{10085}{10192}Listen, Phoebe. You know how much|I love listening to your music...
{10197}{10265}...but...|- But what?
{10304}{10388}This is kind of a classy place.
{10398}{10428}Okay, say no more.
{10531}{10588}Everyone!
{10692}{10731}Classy, huh?
{10866}{10913}Hi, Chandler Bing. I have a reservation.
{10917}{10986}Welcome to the Chestnut Inn.|Where are you joining us from?
{10991}{11063}- New York.|- The Big Apple.
{11067}{11164}He's wound up. We had to stop at every|maple-candy stand on the way here.
{11168}{11246}I ate all my gifts for everybody.
{11282}{11360}I'm sorry, there's no record|of your reservation in the computer.
{11365}{11480}- That's impossible. Check again, please.|- Check again, please.
{11503}{11589}- I'm sorry, it's not here.|- It's not there.
{11594}{11678}Let me get this straight. I called|to try to cancel my reservation...
{11683}{11775}...was told it's not refundable. Then we|drove six hours all the way up here...
{11779}{11855}...and now we don't have a reservation?|- I don't know what to say.
{11860}{11913}She doesn't know what to say.
{11917}{11968}Just give us|the cheapest room you have.
{11973}{12069}The only thing we have available|is our deluxe suite. The rate is $600.
{12074}{12131}- That's insane.|- It's totally insane.
{12136}{12233}Let's drive home. We'll hit all the|maple-candy stores on the way back...
{12237}{12381}...and if they're closed, then maybe we'll|tap a tree and make some ourselves.
{12386}{12484}Does that room have a closet|I can lock him in?
{12499}{12573}- We'll take it.|- Great.
{12578}{12648}- They are totally ripping us off!|- Dude, don't worry about it.
{12653}{12750}I know how to make your money back.|This is a nice hotel. Plenty of amenities.
{12755}{12870}We just load up on those. Like those|apples. Instead of taking one...
{12874}{12927}...I take six.
{12942}{13030}Great. At $ 100 an apple, we're there.
{13035}{13138}Come on, you get the idea. You know,|we'll make our money back in no time.
{13143}{13258}- Dude, you're shaking.|- It's the sugar. Could you hold the apple?
{13374}{13408}- Hi.|- Hey.
{13412}{13527}Joey, I got to tell you, I have been|thinking all day about that scene you did.
{13531}{13580}You were amazing.
{13588}{13666}You know, the writing was good.|And the director's good.
{13670}{13721}And my costar's good.
{13725}{13774}But they're not as good as me!
{13810}{13861}You have to tell me|what happens tomorrow.
{13866}{13932}I'm going over the script now.|Wanna read lines with me?
{13937}{14019}Me? Oh, I'm not an actress.
{14025}{14117}- All right, I can ask Monica.|- Screw her! That part is mine!
{14121}{14188}Okay, so just from the top|of the page right here.
{14192}{14247}Okay.
{14304}{14384}Hello, Drake.|I'm surprised to see you here.
{14389}{14467}- I can't believe you married him.|- Well, what choice did I have?
{14472}{14550}He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.
{14614}{14692}So, what about us?|Everything we feel for each other?
{14697}{14756}It's over. You have to accept that.
{14760}{14867}How can I, knowing I'll never|hold you in my arms again...
{14872}{14969}...or touch your skin or feel your lips...
{14983}{15057}...knowing I'll never make love to you?
{15062}{15134}How can I accept|that I can never kiss you again...
{15138}{15210}...when it's all I can do not|to kiss you right now?
{15290}{15318}Kiss me.
{15348}{15389}What?
{15408}{15440}Kiss me.
{15466}{15573}- Rach, it doesn't say that.|- No, I'm saying it.
{15578}{15646}- But...|- Just don't talk.
{15817}{15864}Well, that's new.
{16091}{16173}Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.
{16179}{16220}I've forgotten a couple of things.
{16225}{16328}Could you have some complimentary|toiletries sent up to my room?
{16332}{16422}Thank you.|Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...
{16427}{16571}...razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,|Band-Aids, shaving cream, after shave.
{16576}{16625}And I feel like I'm forgetting something.
{16629}{16740}Is there anything else you have|that I haven't asked for already?
{16748}{16824}Yeah, go ahead,|send up some tampons.
{16883}{16922}- What'd you get?|{y:i}- USA Today.
{16926}{16973}Nice. Put it with the others.
{16980}{17074}And I also got two more apples.
{17080}{17125}We're four short of a bushel!
{17149}{17246}God, I feel so alive.|I love being in the country!
{17250}{17305}Also, got these great|salt and pepper shakers...
{17310}{17365}...from the restaurant.|- That's not cool.
{17394}{17459}Dude, none of this is cool.
{17473}{17559}Look, Chandler, you have to find|the line between stealing...
{17563}{17618}...and taking what the hotel owes you.
{17622}{17690}For example: A hair dryer, no, no, no.
{17695}{17769}But shampoos and conditioners,|yes, yes, yes.
{17800}{17882}Now, the salt shaker is off limits.
{17887}{17981}But, the salt...
{17985}{18051}I wish I'd thought this through.
{18055}{18152}I think I get what you mean, though.|Like, the lamp is the hotel's...
{18156}{18232}...but the bulbs...|Oh, you already got that.
{18237}{18307}Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
{18311}{18377}- Okay, how about this?|- No, no, no.
{18382}{18489}- You can't take the remote control.|- Yes, but the batteries.
{18611}{18650}Thank you. Thank you very much.
{18656}{18738}- Let's celebrate with some maple candy.|- No!
{18772}{18852}At least tell me where you hid it.
{18940}{19010}- Can I ask you a question?|- Yeah.
{19017}{19089}Have you ever had any...
{19093}{19202}...weird, romantic dreams?
{19232}{19270}Let me think.
{19275}{19400}When I was younger, I used to dream|that I got married to Mayor McCheese.
{19405}{19479}And on our wedding night,|I ate his head.
{19518}{19573}Okay.
{19578}{19637}Well, this is like that...
{19641}{19686}...in no way.
{19691}{19785}I had a dream last night|that I wanted to kiss Joey.
{19790}{19861}Wow! You mean like|"kiss him" kiss him?
{19865}{19945}Oh, yeah.|I mean, it was pretty intense.
{19950}{20001}- What brought that on?|- I don't know.
{20006}{20078}Maybe it had to do with the fact|I saw him do a love scene.
{20083}{20138}- A love scene? With who?|- Olivia.
{20143}{20221}Olivia?!|I thought she was marrying Connor?!
{20226}{20300}Oh, right. Real life more important.
{20306}{20388}- You think my dream means anything?|- I don't know.
{20393}{20498}I mean, you saw him do a love scene.|Maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.
{20503}{20575}Maybe you have a thing for Drake.
{20633}{20738}Well, it was Joey reading|Drake's lines in the dream.
{20744}{20834}Of course it was. Trust me,|when it comes to psychology...
{20838}{20916}...I know what I'm talking about.
{20920}{21020}- I took two psych classes in college.|- You took the same class twice.
{21025}{21086}- It was hard!|- I know.
{21102}{21157}- Hey.|- Hi.
{21162}{21281}Here, Monica, look what I got to wear|when I play at your restaurant.
{21385}{21438}Wait.
{21474}{21589}Right? I think this might even class up|"The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man."
{21658}{21697}Phoebe...
{21701}{21772}...maybe I wasn't clear before.
{21776}{21860}I really love listening|to your music here.
{21864}{21932}But my restaurant,|it's sort of an upscale place.
{21938}{22051}Right, yeah, okay. I'll ask the butler|to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
{22056}{22124}Phoebe, it's not what you wear.
{22129}{22205}It's sort of your songs.
{22209}{22281}I just don't think you should play|at the restaurant anymore.
{22349}{22419}Okay. Fine, I'll just...
{22423}{22489}I'll take the hat back.
{22534}{22585}There.
{22712}{22786}Hey, so you guys, the funniest|thing happened at work the...
{22792}{22841}My songs aren't good enough|for your restaurant?
{22847}{22908}Okay, we're still on that.
{22914}{22998}- I didn't say they weren't good enough.|- Then what's wrong with them?
{23002}{23076}What, they don't go with your|tiny portions of pretentious food?
{23102}{23161}- Tiny portions?|- Yeah, well, "Excuse me.
{23165}{23290}I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,|but I can't see it. I can't see it."
{23341}{23435}- Phoebe, it's not about quantity.|- Well, it's not about quality.
{23458}{23513}Oh, really?|You wanna talk about quality?
{23519}{23622}Have you ever heard of a "key"?|It's what some people sing in.
{23627}{23721}Well, at least all my songs|don't taste like garlic.
{23727}{23786}Yeah, there are other|ingredients, Monica.
{23812}{23849}So that's what we're doing.
{23854}{23926}When I'm in a coffeehouse bopping|along to one of your songs...
{23930}{24018}...I'm wearing earplugs.|- Earplugs or cloves of garlic?
{24066}{24117}You know what?|I take back what I said before.
{24122}{24216}Keep playing at the restaurant, because|with your music driving people inside...
{24220}{24261}...my bar sales|have gone up like crazy.
{24265}{24337}What are people having,|the garlic martini?
{24408}{24463}Here's your bill.|We hope you enjoyed your stay.
{24468}{24558}Oh, we did.|And you still have all your lamps.
{24607}{24697}- I didn't factor in the room tax.|- Dude, don't worry about it.
{24701}{24822}I found an unattended maid's cart.|We're way ahead of the game.
{24827}{24882}- Oh, my God.|- What?
{24886}{24949}There's something new in the bowl.
{24953}{25068}- Look, we have enough. Just walk away.|- No, but I want the pine cones.
{25089}{25179}- There's a forest right outside.|- It's not the same.
{25184}{25245}Okay, go quick.
{25411}{25478}Thank you for a delightful stay.
{25682}{25752}My maple candy!
{26011}{26124}It's just you. I thought someone was|swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
{26133}{26242}You'd better get back in that kitchen.|The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.
{26246}{26307}- Okay, you have to stop playing now.|- Why?
{26311}{26366}The only person my playing|is bothering is you.
{26370}{26495}- Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.|- Get your garlic peelers off me.
{26511}{26556}Excuse me? Excuse me?
{26561}{26645}Hi, I'm Monica Geller.|I'm the head chef here.
{26661}{26745}Okay, I was actually expecting|a little applause there, but whatever.
{26751}{26817}Quick question.|By a show of hands...
{26821}{26922}...how many of you were bothered|by this woman's singing outside?
{26939}{27029}Okay, okay. How many of you|enjoyed the music outside?
{27088}{27172}Let me ask you this question.|How many thought the music was fine...
{27176}{27272}...but not in keeping with the tone|of the restaurant?
{27276}{27401}Who identified this restaurant's tone|as "pretentious-comma-garlicky"?
{27405}{27551}Okay, who thinks the food is delicious|and a little pretension never hurt anyone?
{27570}{27654}Okay, well, all right, who thinks|the food is fine, the music was fine...
{27658}{27742}...but your evening was ruined|by this incessant poll-taking?
{27830}{27889}Excuse us.
{27949}{28002}All right, here's a question.
{28022}{28102}Who was so worried about|her restaurant being fancy...
{28107}{28183}...that she made a big deal about|her friend playing her music...
{28188}{28266}...and feels really bad about it now?
{28292}{28353}Well, who was so stupid|and stubborn...
{28358}{28415}...that she lashed out|against her friend's cooking...
{28419}{28499}...which she actually thinks|is pretty great?
{28505}{28575}- I'm sorry.|- I'm sorry too.
{28582}{28652}Hey, you wanna stick around|and I'll whip you up some dinner?
{28658}{28771}Yeah, as long as it's free.|The food here is ridiculously overpr...
{28834}{28951}Who hopes the hand-raising thing is still|cute enough that you won't hate me?
{29087}{29200}Joey, do you have peanut butter|on the back of your head?
{29257}{29335}Oh, man. I thought I got it all.
{29369}{29404}How...?
{29409}{29452}How?
{29458}{29517}I was making a peanut butter|smoothie, right?
{29521}{29620}I couldn't find this little plastic thingy|that goes in the top of the blender.
{29625}{29724}And I thought, "Well, you know,|how important can that be?" Right?
{29739}{29780}Turns out, very.
{29824}{29869}Wow, definitely just Drake.
{29885}{29938}- What?|- How's it going with Drake?
{29965}{30022}- I don't think it's going very well.|- What?
{30027}{30070}That scene I saw was so good.
{30076}{30187}Well, I'm feeling really insecure|about the one we're shooting tomorrow.
{30194}{30293}Is this that thing you do when you say|you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
{30301}{30348}A little.
{30353}{30505}No, I really am worried. I have to make it|convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
{30510}{30582}- So?|- So I've never played that.
{30587}{30677}Oh, honey, it can't be that hard.|I mean, you've been in love before.
{30695}{30775}Well, just once...
{30779}{30834}...with you.
{30870}{30921}Okay. Well, this could be|a little awkward.
{30926}{30985}I'm just gonna blow past it.
{30990}{31062}Well, look, can't you just use|that method-actor thing...
{31068}{31185}...where you use your real-life memories|to help you in your performance?
{31189}{31246}What the hell are you talking about?
{31326}{31445}All right, look, just try to remember|how you felt when you were in love...
{31450}{31534}...and think about that|when you're playing the scene.
{31588}{31666}Okay. Yeah, I think I can do that.
{31671}{31745}Yeah. Okay, there's this|party scene coming up.
{31749}{31802}And Olivia and her husband are there...
{31807}{31932}...and all Drake wants to do is|grab her and kiss her, but he can't.
{31936}{32045}That makes me think about those times|I wanted to grab you and kiss you...
{32049}{32127}...but you didn't know, so I would|just pretend everything was cool...
{32132}{32181}...but really it was killing me.
{32229}{32325}Joey, you never|talked about that before.
{32376}{32448}Hey, you know what else I could use?
{32452}{32532}There's this scene where Drake|sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...
{32536}{32641}...and she doesn't know he's there,|which never happened with us.
{32674}{32793}I mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,|but he just wants to look at her.
{32827}{32862}You know?
{32866}{32985}And I remember all those mornings|before you even put on your makeup...
{32990}{33119}...when I would think to myself,|"My God, she is beautiful."
{33160}{33281}And it hurt so much because I knew|I could never tell you.
{33346}{33465}But it was worth it just to be there|looking at you.
{33601}{33646}Thanks, dude. This is great!
{33903}{33958}I got you something from Vermont.
{33963}{34014}Besides tampons and salt?
{34053}{34094}Oh, my God.
{34099}{34185}Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.
{34210}{34257}That's weird, it's empty.
{34266}{34391}Hi, you guys. What's going on?|You guys wanna hang out or...?
{34544}{34587}Do you guys hear a buzzing?

{80}{147}Hey, you guys? What are|you doing tomorrow night?
{151}{229}Oh, well, let me see.|I believe I'm...
{233}{285}Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
{311}{390}Well, my agent hooked me up|with six tickets to a great play.
{394}{433}I could fall asleep at a play.
{461}{510}- What is it?|- It's a one-woman play called:
{514}{615}{y:i}Why Don 't You Like Me?|{y:i}A Bitter Woman 's Journey Through Life.
{627}{691}- That sounds interesting.|- That does sound interesting.
{695}{804}To listen to a woman complain for|two hours. I don't think it gets bet...
{842}{922}I know! I know. We can drive.|We can vote. We can work.
{926}{986}What more do these broads want?
{1006}{1066}Well, you guys will have a great time.|I promise.
{1070}{1112}What? How come you don't have to go?
{1116}{1154}I wish I could, but I found out...
{1158}{1242}...that I have to be at work really|early the next day, so I can't go.
{1246}{1309}But take the extra ticket|and invite whoever you want.
{1326}{1383}Let's see. Who do I hate?
{1437}{1470}Oh, sorry.
{1478}{1513}- Oops, sorry.|- Okay.
{1517}{1555}- Okay.|- Okay. Up we go.
{1559}{1612}- Oh, gosh, okay!|- All right.
{1843}{1898}Can I ask you a question?
{1908}{2000}Do you think it's possible|for two friends to fool around...
{2004}{2081}...and not have it be a big deal?
{2115}{2175}No, I don't think that ever works.|Why?
{2200}{2259}- No reason.|- No, no. Rachel?
{2266}{2354}- Who do you want to fool around with?|- Nobody! Forget it.
{2360}{2385}Joey?
{2407}{2446}Maybe.
{2474}{2510}- You can't.|- Why?
{2514}{2543}Because!
{2627}{2710}Okay, seriously, did not understand|a word you just said.
{2735}{2789}- In the hall.|- Okay.
{2853}{2898}- You wanna fool around with Joey?|- Yeah.
{2902}{2987}Ever since I had that dream about him,|I can't get it out of my head.
{2991}{3054}I mean, what's the big deal?|People do it all the time.
{3058}{3122}Who do you know that are friends|that just fool around?
{3126}{3228}Okay. Off the top of my head...|Don and Janet.
{3232}{3296}- Who are they?|- I know them from work.
{3312}{3367}- Both of them?|- No, just one of them.
{3371}{3414}Which one?
{3424}{3488}I don't know.|What were the names I just said?
{3492}{3559}No, Rachel, things could get|incredibly complicated.
{3563}{3646}You're right. I won't do anything|with Joey. I just thought it...
{3650}{3766}Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,|a pound of baking soda and a red onion?
{3802}{3842}What the hell are you cooking?

{5136}{5205}You guys won't believe|what I have to do for work today.
{5209}{5318}Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career|of talking about dinosaurs.
{5344}{5428}There are these two professors|who are joining my department...
{5445}{5529}...and I have to meet them here|and show them around campus.
{5533}{5560}What's bad about that?
{5564}{5629}I just know they'll be|a couple of old windbags...
{5633}{5718}...wearing tweed jackets|with suede elbow patches.
{5742}{5768}Ross?
{5772}{5836}What? These aren't suede.
{5923}{5996}Excuse me. I'm looking for someone.
{6000}{6073}You don't, by any chance,|know a Ross Geller?
{6077}{6102}No.
{6189}{6266}Hi. Hi, I'm Ross Geller.
{6270}{6336}Oh, hi. I'm Professor Wheeler.
{6365}{6443}Oh, that's... That's...|That's nice.
{6459}{6491}It's good to meet you.
{6495}{6564}Thank you so much for taking the time|to show me around.
{6568}{6612}No, it's no big deal.
{6616}{6720}If I weren't doing this, I'd just,|you know, be at the gym working out.
{6746}{6776}Is he gonna introduce us?
{6780}{6860}I think we're just blurry shapes|to him now.
{6882}{6936}By the way,|I really enjoyed your paper...
{6940}{7047}...on the connection between geographic|isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
{7058}{7122}I wrote that in one night.
{7163}{7224}Twenty bucks says they're married|within the month.
{7248}{7303}Well, we should probably get going.
{7325}{7374}We've got a lot of ground to cover.
{7378}{7443}Isn't another professor|supposed to come with us?
{7462}{7512}I don't think so.
{7521}{7584}I'm pretty sure.|A Professor Spafford from Cornell?
{7588}{7662}Well, he's obviously late,|and the rule in my class is:
{7666}{7761}If you can't come on time,|then don't come at all.
{7765}{7841}An option that many of my students use.
{7862}{7912}- Shall we?|- We shouldn't wait for him?
{7916}{7994}You know what, he's a big boy.|I'm sure he'll find us, okay?
{7998}{8055}- Professor Geller?|- Oh, damn it!
{8311}{8376}"Hi", "it's Jan Rogers."|{y:i}Can 't wait for your party tonight.
{8380}{8491}"Listen", "I forgot your address."|{y:i}Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.
{8574}{8602}What's happening?
{8628}{8709}It's a real shame you can't make it|to that one-woman show tonight.
{8713}{8786}I'd love to, but I gotta get up|so early the next day.
{8790}{8879}- You know me, work comes first.|- Oh, yeah, yeah.
{8906}{9000}"Hi", "it's Jan Rogers."|{y:i}Can 't wait for your party tonight.
{9043}{9098}Stupid Jan Rogers!
{9122}{9170}You are having a party tonight?
{9183}{9259}I'm kind of having a thing|for the "Days of Our Lives" people.
{9263}{9296}You weren't gonna tell us?
{9300}{9358}How did you think|you'd get away with that?
{9362}{9406}I do it every year.
{9445}{9494}You do that every year?!
{9498}{9550}I didn't have to tell you that!
{9558}{9623}God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers!
{9647}{9724}That's why you got us tickets|to that play, to get rid of us!
{9728}{9754}Yeah.
{9758}{9841}Last year is that why you sent us|to that Medieval Times restaurant?
{9845}{9874}Yeah.
{9895}{10006}The year before that, you set up that|nighttime tour of that button factory?
{10010}{10084}I can't believe you guys went|for that one.
{10088}{10143}Why wouldn't you invite us|to your parties?
{10149}{10251}You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts|like an idiot around famous people.
{10255}{10324}Well, then, so just invite me.
{10338}{10416}Please, I was trying to be nice.|You're the worst one.
{10420}{10516}Joey, come on! Please, please?|Let me come. I will behave. I promise.
{10520}{10604}- I will behave. Please, please, please.|- Okay, fine. You can come.
{10608}{10695}But don't tell anybody else.|It's up on the roof at 8.
{10701}{10737}A soap-opera roof party?!
{10741}{10829}I'm going to a soap-opera roof party!|Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
{10893}{10943}And it's out of my system.
{11078}{11212}And then my wife and I went|on a cruise to the Galapagos.
{11216}{11317}There was a seafood buffet|you wouldn't believe.
{11326}{11444}There were clams and mussels|and oysters...
{11448}{11503}...and cracked crab...
{11507}{11559}...and snow crab...
{11563}{11623}...and king crab.
{11627}{11702}It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.
{11740}{11810}So where did you get|your undergraduate degree?
{11814}{11904}- And that's not all I'm allergic to.|- Oh, it's not over.
{11908}{12007}I'm also allergic to peanuts|and cashews...
{12011}{12063}...and almonds and filberts...
{12067}{12107}So basically all nuts!
{12114}{12165}Interestingly, no.
{12185}{12277}You're kind of playing it fast and loose|with the word "interesting."
{12318}{12406}If you'll excuse me,|I'm going to use the restroom.
{12435}{12474}Oh, my God!
{12478}{12530}I've lost the will to live.
{12571}{12607}- Let's ditch him.|- What?
{12611}{12676}While he's still in the bathroom.|I am begging you.
{12680}{12771}Okay. Okay, fine,|but I just have one question for you.
{12775}{12849}When we exit, should we walk or run...
{12853}{12910}...or prance or stroll...?
{12914}{13030}Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow,|but he might pee fast. Okay, let's move!
{13263}{13317}Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.
{13323}{13391}Charlie, this is Phoebe|and my sister, Monica.
{13395}{13471}- Hi.|- Charlie will be joining my department.
{13475}{13527}- You're a paleontologist too?|- Yeah.
{13535}{13584}Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...
{13588}{13692}...of Renyard's new theory of species|variegation in segmented arthropods?
{13737}{13851}Well, I think he's a little out there,|but he does have some interesting ideas.
{13868}{13937}Oh, I'm sorry. I have to take this.|Excuse me.
{13944}{14006}Renyard's theory of species variegation?
{14010}{14134}I saw the article on your coffee table.|I memorized the title to freak you out.
{14186}{14226}So did you two have fun?
{14230}{14289}Oh, my God. She's great.
{14293}{14396}We have so much in common, and she's|just cool, you know? And funny.
{14400}{14489}And I don't know if you've noticed,|but she's a hottie!
{14497}{14522}Hi!
{14669}{14760}Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,|I'm not feeling really well...
{14764}{14846}...and I don't think I'm gonna get|to go to the play.
{14850}{14882}Really? What's wrong?
{14886}{14939}I don't know.|I think it's kind of serious.
{14943}{15026}You know, I was watching this thing|on TV this morning...
{15030}{15132}...about Newcastle disease,|and I think I might have it.
{15141}{15201}Newcastle disease is|a secretion-borne virus...
{15205}{15271}...that only affects chickens|and other poultry.
{15323}{15365}Okay, who's this?
{15378}{15458}I'm sorry. Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.|She's a colleague.
{15462}{15508}Hi. Well, I would shake your hand...
{15512}{15591}...but I'm sure you don't want|to get my chicken disease.
{15604}{15681}- Rachel, can I see you for a second?|- Sure.
{15806}{15836}You're not sick.
{15844}{15887}What? Yes, I am!
{15891}{15950}Okay, then why are you all dressed up?
{16001}{16095}When you're sick, you do whatever|you can to make yourself feel better.
{16133}{16212}You just want to stay home|so you can make a move on Joey.
{16216}{16283}No, I heard you before.|That is so not what this is.
{16287}{16341}Okay, then what is this?
{16357}{16382}Okay.
{16408}{16484}Joey is having a secret|"Days of Our Lives" party up on the roof.
{16488}{16549}And he sent you guys to the play|to get rid of you.
{16559}{16601}What?!
{16621}{16651}What? What's going on?
{16655}{16742}Joey is having a secret|"Days of Our Lives" party up on the roof!
{16746}{16852}He didn't want you to know about it,|but I came over here to tell you.
{16866}{16951}- You came to say you were sick.|- All right, professor or detective?
{16977}{17064}Wait, Joey's having a party,|and he wasn't gonna invite us?
{17068}{17154}He does it every year.|That's why he's sending you to the play.
{17158}{17259}That's why he sent us to that medieval|restaurant and to that button factory.
{17263}{17317}And that horrible museum tour?
{17325}{17368}No, I arranged that.
{17454}{17531}Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.|Have fun.
{17613}{17654}We know about your party, Joey.
{17658}{17742}- What party?|- The game's over. Take off your robe.
{17770}{17813}Okay, I mean...
{17874}{17955}Close it up! Close it up!
{18003}{18035}Nice to meet you.
{18264}{18310}Hey, you made it! All right!
{18314}{18367}Glad you could make it.|Thanks for coming.
{18376}{18447}- Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!|- Hi.
{18463}{18505}I love you!
{18509}{18597}That's why I didn't invite you.|You have to calm down, all right?
{18601}{18649}Just get yourself a drink|or something.
{18653}{18722}Oh, yeah, that's what you want.|My inhibitions lowered.
{18748}{18814}Oh, my God, can you believe|we're surrounded by all this?
{18818}{18855}I can barely control myself.
{18859}{18922}You might want to remember|that you're married.
{18926}{18980}Where is Chandler anyway?
{18984}{19022}Oh, my God! Chandler!
{19180}{19246}Where the hell is everybody?
{19298}{19362}{y:i}Why Don 't You Like Me?
{19457}{19535}Chapter 1: My First Period.
{19645}{19695}Hey, Joey said no autographs.
{19699}{19750}But if she's getting one,|I want one too!
{19754}{19853}"To Monica." And none of this|"best wishes" crap. I want "love."
{19871}{19978}Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was|giving me his phone number.
{19982}{20049}Oh, man! If I had known|I was coming to this party...
{20053}{20098}...I never would've gotten married!
{20126}{20176}- It was nice to meet you.|- Nice to meet you.
{20180}{20230}- Call me.|- We will!
{20273}{20382}Look at you with all the guys!|I guess you've forgotten all about Joey.
{20386}{20453}Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten|about Joey.
{20457}{20514}And clearly, you've forgotten|about Chandler.
{20538}{20589}Please. Chandler's|the love of my life.
{20593}{20643}Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!
{20715}{20810}So it's probably gonna be hard|for you to leave Boston, huh?
{20814}{20907}Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.|I just broke up with someone.
{20911}{20965}Oh, so sad.
{20978}{21043}Still, it can't be easy|for you to leave Harvard.
{21047}{21145}Especially after working with a Nobel|Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.
{21155}{21222}Actually, Albie is the guy|I broke up with.
{21226}{21301}- You dated Albert Wintermeyer?|- Yeah.
{21305}{21375}And you called him "Albie"?
{21395}{21496}I mean, that's like calling|Albert Einstein...
{21515}{21540}Albie.
{21584}{21637}Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
{21641}{21693}You think?|I mean, you dated the guy...
{21697}{21780}...who improved the accuracy|of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
{21784}{21888}Yes, and while that is everything|one looks for in a boyfriend...
{21892}{21932}...he had a lot of issues.
{21936}{21981}Oh, like what?
{21990}{22066}I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry.|It's just that this must be...
{22070}{22170}...what regular people experience|when they watch "Access Hollywood."
{22181}{22223}Okay, you want the dirt?
{22227}{22278}Albie was seriously insecure.
{22282}{22359}He was really intimidated by the guy|I dated before him.
{22363}{22445}Who's intimidating to a guy|who won the Nobel Prize?
{22449}{22497}A guy who won two.
{22510}{22541}Two? What...?
{22545}{22616}Don't tell me you dated|Benjamin Hobart?
{22620}{22665}Yeah, for three years.
{22669}{22702}Oh, my God.
{22723}{22826}Have you ever dated someone|who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
{22862}{22901}No.
{22920}{22971}But there was|my first boyfriend, Billy.
{22975}{23031}Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?
{23035}{23114}No, but he did just win|a MacArthur "genius grant."
{23126}{23186}What a loser.
{23224}{23269}Some more wine?
{23369}{23427}Hey, Ross. How's it going|with Charlie?
{23431}{23476}Oh, great. After I finish my wine...
{23480}{23574}...I'm gonna blow|my average-sized brains out.
{23585}{23616}What's the matter?
{23620}{23731}She only dates geniuses|and Nobel Prize winners.
{23735}{23802}Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant|earlier today...
{23806}{23910}...I put chopsticks in my mouth|and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.
{23922}{23968}I always loved that.
{23972}{24056}Of course you would!|Your brains are smaller than mine!
{24091}{24156}I can't compete with the guys|she goes out with.
{24160}{24221}They're so out of my league.
{24233}{24260}Oh, my God!
{24264}{24311}- Worse?|- Oh, much, much worse.
{24315}{24415}I did my impression of Joan Rivers|as one of the earliest amphibians.
{24419}{24446}"Can we walk?"
{24499}{24554}- Oh, you like that?|- No.
{24558}{24588}What?
{24592}{24672}Come on! I think that's funny!
{24688}{24727}Woolly mammoth.
{24731}{24772}It's good!
{24823}{24923}I bet you're thinking that now would be|a great time for an intermission, huh?
{24927}{24990}Oh, yes. God, yes.
{25004}{25050}Well, you're not gonna get one!
{25054}{25136}Because in life, there are|no intermissions, people!
{25166}{25257}Now, Chapter 7:|Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!
{25301}{25360}How could he leave me?!
{25402}{25466}I don't know. You seem lovely.
{25633}{25735}Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.|Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
{25739}{25797}- Nice to meet you.|- So, what show are you on?
{25801}{25882}I'm not an actor.|I'm a professor of paleontology.
{25902}{25944}That's science.
{25957}{26023}Hey, well, listen,|I play a scientist on "Days."
{26027}{26096}Yeah, my character just won|a Nobel Prize.
{26142}{26260}Dirk was wondering about the woman|you brought and if you two are together?
{26290}{26318}Well, no, but...
{26322}{26416}I mean, she only goes out|with really, really smart guys.
{26420}{26495}Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
{26536}{26574}I'd lead with that.
{26629}{26696}That's it. Just sign right on the bra.
{26717}{26742}Monica!
{26754}{26831}Don't worry, Joe.|I won't come next year!
{26928}{26958}What the...?
{26962}{26993}What do you got there?
{26997}{27057}Just some boys gave me|their phone numbers.
{27061}{27115}Oh, really? Let me see.
{27134}{27192}Damn, that's a lot of guys.
{27196}{27251}Are you a little slutty?
{27293}{27346}I think I am.
{27352}{27423}Let me see if I approve|of any of these clowns.
{27427}{27481}- This guy wears a rug.|- Well...
{27485}{27543}This guy's Canadian.
{27555}{27617}Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?
{27621}{27735}Lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,|and I don't feel any different.
{27773}{27823}Pass. Pa... Oh, pass. Pass.
{27827}{27904}- Why? What's wrong with these guys?|- Well, nothing major.
{27908}{27990}It's just that, you know,|they're not really good enough for you...
{27994}{28047}...and you deserve the best.
{28050}{28105}Joey, you're so sweet.
{28109}{28214}It's true, but it doesn't matter. I already|know who you're going home with.
{28218}{28259}Who?
{28344}{28376}Me.
{28381}{28419}What?
{28433}{28475}Really?
{28483}{28559}Yeah, because we live together.|It's a joke! It's a joke.
{28563}{28618}Right! That's funny! I get it!
{28622}{28692}- Got you!|- You're funny, Joey.
{28704}{28746}Oh, my God.
{28891}{28957}So how did you enjoy the play?
{28969}{29086}Oh, my God.|Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.
{29090}{29115}You should be.
{29119}{29220}You missed the most powerful|three hours in the history of the theater.
{29224}{29300}- You really liked it?|- Oh, yeah. I mean, at first I hated it.
{29304}{29405}But why wouldn't I? Because as a man,|I've been trained not to listen!
{29476}{29600}But after Chapter 16:|Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...
{29621}{29672}...I was uplifted.
{29698}{29724}- Oh, really?|- Oh, yeah.
{29728}{29806}I had no idea the amazing journey|you go through as a woman.
{29816}{29905}Tell me...|Tell me about your first period.
{29947}{29977}No!
{30019}{30058}Did somebody sign your bra?
{30062}{30158}So I got it when I was 13.|Very difficult.
{30187}{30299}Hey, Ross? So listen,|about you and the dinosaur girl?
{30303}{30391}Are you really just gonna let|a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?
{30395}{30451}What is that?|Come on, a piece of paper?
{30455}{30505}It's actually a million-dollar prize.
{30514}{30561}Go, Charlie!
{30574}{30631}But my point is...
{30635}{30729}...okay, so she dated them,|but she also broke up with them.
{30733}{30867}Maybe she's looking to, you know,|slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.
{30899}{31010}Yeah, maybe, and I do have|my whole career in front of me.
{31014}{31049}I mean...
{31053}{31123}I could still win a Nobel Prize.
{31127}{31267}Although the last two papers|I've written were widely discredited.
{31311}{31432}You're so much more than just brains.|You are sweet and kind and funny.
{31439}{31472}And sexy.
{31475}{31551}Okay, well, give her a chance|to see all that.
{31561}{31607}Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
{31611}{31672}- Thanks. I'm gonna go find her.|- Good for you.
{31676}{31794}Your paper on punctuated equilibrium|in the Devonian Era was topnotch.
{31798}{31846}Stop going through my stuff!
{31954}{32022}I just wanted to let you know|I've changed my mind.
{32026}{32075}I'm gonna do it.|I'm gonna kiss Joey.
{32079}{32162}No! You can't!|Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
{32166}{32215}Please! What about you and Chandler?
{32219}{32290}That's different.|I was drunk and stupid.
{32294}{32350}Well, hello?
{32372}{32455}What about all the guys that you got|the phone numbers from?
{32459}{32521}- Why don't you just kiss one of them.|- I could...
{32525}{32610}...but I don't want to.|I want to kiss Joey.
{32626}{32722}All right. I think it's a big mistake,|but it's your decision.
{32836}{32873}I'm gonna do it.
{32876}{32937}- And I can't stop you?|- No.
{33251}{33329}Hey, Rach, have you seen|Charlie anywhere?
{33467}{33524}I'm smarter than him!
{33671}{33740}Hey, thank you so much|for these tickets, Chandler.
{33744}{33849}This was a really important experience|for me. I wanted to share it with you.
{33853}{33896}You're so wonderful.
{33928}{33978}{y:i}Why Don 't You Like Me?
{34013}{34095}Chapter 1: My First Period.
{34143}{34227}I can't believe you guys bought that.|Enjoy your slow death.

{115}{205}It's so weird. How did Joey|end up kissing Charlie last night?
{209}{309}- I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.|- I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.
{313}{357}But surprise!
{387}{446}I missed most of the party.
{450}{484}Charlie's a girl, right?
{511}{617}Yeah, she's this new professor|in my department that I did not kiss.
{630}{735}I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.|Of all the girls at the party, God!
{767}{866}- Why do you care so much?|- Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?
{941}{1057}Because Ross is the father of my child.
{1061}{1162}You know, and I want him|to hook up with lots of women.
{1172}{1289}All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey|and Charlie have anything in common.
{1293}{1393}I don't know. They seemed to have|a shared interest in each other's tonsils.
{1404}{1510}Wow. Joey and a professor.|Can you imagine if they had kids?
{1514}{1573}And if the kids got her intelligence...
{1577}{1649}...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...
{1653}{1711}...those nerds would get laid!
{1756}{1838}All right. So, Ross, you're|okay with all this? I mean...
{1842}{1916}It's no big deal.|I just met her. I'm fine with it.
{1990}{2053}God, I forgot how hot she was.
{2071}{2125}I'm gonna get some more coffee.
{2129}{2200}- Oh, you know, I'll come with you.|- Okay.
{2225}{2331}- So a professor, huh?|- Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.
{2335}{2404}Her mind is totally acrimonious.
{2536}{2601}Guess that's not how she used it.
{2647}{2707}I feel like I owe you an explanation.
{2711}{2807}I don't ordinarily go around|kissing guys at parties.
{2811}{2846}I'm...
{2859}{2956}Well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really|hope you don't think less of me.
{2960}{3021}Think less of you? No.|I don't think less of you.
{3025}{3093}I mean, you saw someone you liked|and you kissed them.
{3097}{3178}Those people who like someone|and don't kiss them...
{3182}{3274}...those people are stupid.|I hate those people.
{3284}{3334}Actually, I'm a little surprised|at myself.
{3338}{3415}I mean, Joey's so different|from the guys I usually date.
{3419}{3495}They're all professors, intellectuals.|Paleontologists mostly.
{3499}{3570}- You know, very cerebral...|- Yeah, I know the type.
{3580}{3686}If we want to grab a bite before work,|we'd better get acrimonious.
{3741}{3812}No?|Am I getting close?

{5067}{5092}- Hey!|- Hi.
{5096}{5155}Hey, you guys.|Look what I just got.
{5187}{5264}Oh, wow! I love those!|Where did you get them?
{5268}{5386}I bought them off eBay. They used|to belong to the late Shania Twain.
{5458}{5516}Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.
{5539}{5583}Oh, then I overpaid.
{5649}{5678}Hey, what's this?
{5682}{5757}Oh, it's a gift certificate|to this new spa in SoHo.
{5761}{5853}You can't show Phoebe this. She hates|those corporate massage chains.
{5865}{5918}What, now I can't get a massage?
{5922}{6003}There are so many things|that she disapproves of.
{6007}{6082}I can't eat veal. I can't wear fur.
{6086}{6144}I can't go hunting.
{6168}{6251}- Do you want to go hunting?|- I would like to have the option.
{6301}{6366}What's that? Hey, Rachel?
{6370}{6413}No, you can't go there!
{6417}{6480}You know how I feel about|these big massage places.
{6484}{6543}They're putting people like me|out of business.
{6547}{6602}She wants to go hunting too!
{6689}{6740}Phoebe, come on,|I don't want to waste it.
{6744}{6797}It would be like throwing|away 100 bucks.
{6801}{6873}Okay, this is not about|the money. Okay?
{6877}{6954}It's about corporate greed|destroying our hearts...
{6958}{7034}...and leaving us hollow shells.
{7066}{7129}I don't care about any of that.
{7178}{7289}Well, do you care about friendship?|I feel really strongly about this.
{7294}{7383}Please don't use this gift certificate.|I'm asking you as a friend.
{7388}{7485}Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!
{7506}{7537}Fine. I won't use it.
{7541}{7588}- Promise?|- I promise.
{7592}{7678}- Thank you.|- Well, I am going hunting.
{7818}{7876}Hey, honey. I missed you today.
{7880}{7940}- Oh, yeah?|- Yeah. Hey.
{7958}{8074}- What do you wanna do tonight?|- Oh, well, maybe we could...
{8305}{8389}Okay, trying to turn me on|by making a mess?
{8393}{8431}Know your audience.
{8471}{8550}Besides, tomorrow we're doing|those fertility tests.
{8554}{8626}Until then, you need to keep|your tadpoles in the tank.
{8661}{8712}Do we really need to take those tests?
{8716}{8766}We've been trying|to have a baby for a year.
{8770}{8840}I think it's a good idea|to find out if everything's okay.
{8844}{8941}- Just a few routine tests.|- But I don't want to do it in a cup.
{8955}{9053}- What is the big deal?|- It's weird! You're in a doctor's office.
{9057}{9113}It's not okay to do it|in a doctor's office...
{9117}{9199}...but it is okay to do it in|a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
{9268}{9355}I cannot believe Ross told you that.
{9369}{9464}And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.
{9472}{9534}Look, I don't want to do|these tests either.
{9538}{9594}But I really do think|it's a good idea.
{9598}{9655}I'm sure a doctor's office|can't be worse...
{9659}{9737}...than on a class trip|to the Hershey factory.
{9749}{9809}Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!
{9980}{10060}Who says wine has to cost|more than milk?
{10202}{10227}- Hey!|- Hi.
{10232}{10285}- Come on in. How are you?|- I'm good.
{10289}{10354}- Can I offer you a drink?|- Please.
{10358}{10413}I have been crazed all day.
{10417}{10492}I had a meeting with the dean,|my syllabus for summer school's due...
{10496}{10547}...and I'm writing the foreword|for a book.
{10551}{10661}I had a pretty hectic day at work too.|Today I had to open a door and go:
{10719}{10766}So I am just so excited to be here.
{10770}{10848}- I can't wait to explore the city.|- Lf you need a tour guide...
{10852}{10910}Oh, you mean it?|That would be so fun.
{10914}{11011}Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.|What do you want to see first?
{11015}{11115}We could go see the Kronos Quartet|at Avery Fisher Hall.
{11201}{11231}Okay.
{11235}{11331}There's a collection of Walt Whitman|letters on display at the public library.
{11337}{11382}I know.
{11416}{11518}- But first, I have to see the Met.|- Okay, let me stop you right there.
{11522}{11593}The Mets suck, okay?
{11639}{11697}You wanna see the Yankees.
{11701}{11766}No. No, not the Mets.|The Met. Singular.
{11770}{11828}Which one? They all suck.
{11846}{11884}The museum.
{11926}{11975}I don't think so.
{12115}{12194}- Hi there.|- Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.
{12198}{12243}How may I help you?
{12263}{12354}Hi. I have a massage appointment|under Rachel Green.
{12358}{12473}- Okay.|- And here is my gift certificate.
{12510}{12627}- This has been torn up.|- And taped back together.
{12657}{12741}Okay. Well, I'll call you as soon|as your massage therapist is ready.
{12745}{12807}- Okay.|- Have a seat through the glass doors.
{12817}{12913}- Through the glass doors.|- Through the glass doors.
{12941}{12975}Alrighty then.
{13161}{13228}Phoebe, your next client's|in the waiting room.
{13232}{13314}Do we have to talk like that|when they're not around?
{13389}{13429}Oh, no. No, no.
{13444}{13530}Listen, is there someone|who can fill in for me?
{13535}{13615}- Sorry. Everyone is booked.|- That woman can't know I work here.
{13619}{13680}She's a friend of mine|and I made this big stink...
{13684}{13735}...about how awful|these massage chains are.
{13739}{13826}- Then why do you work here?|- Because it's good money.
{13837}{13878}But that doesn't change the fact...
{13882}{13959}...that this is an evil, bloodsucking|corporate machine.
{13973}{14049}Well, I think this is a great place|to work.
{14091}{14157}Okay, are they listening?
{14248}{14287}- Ross. Hey.|- Hi.
{14291}{14366}I need to talk to you about Charlie.
{14371}{14430}Oh, do you? Do you really?
{14442}{14501}Yeah, I'm kind of having|a little problem.
{14509}{14625}Look, if you don't know what the word|"acrimonious" means, just don't use it.
{14646}{14686}Look, you know Charlie, right?
{14690}{14785}- She's cool, funny, her body is so...|- Get to the problem.
{14789}{14896}Right. She's just so much smarter|than all the girls I've ever dated.
{14900}{14946}Combined.
{14950}{15067}You know? And I just...|I don't want her to think I'm stupid.
{15138}{15197}Are you wearing two belts?
{15234}{15290}Hey, what do you know?
{15399}{15474}You were saying you didn't want|to seem stupid.
{15478}{15564}Well, she wants to go|to all these cultural places...
{15568}{15670}...and I don't know how to talk about|that stuff. You gotta help me out.
{15674}{15745}I don't want to get involved|in your guys' relationship.
{15749}{15824}Oh, dude, please. Come on,|you're the smartest person I know.
{15828}{15927}And I really like this girl, okay?|I don't want to lose her.
{16011}{16040}- Fine.|- Thanks.
{16044}{16088}Okay. Let's see.
{16092}{16184}- Oh, you should take her to the Met.|- The Mets.
{16212}{16308}No, no, no. The Met.|The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
{16347}{16403}Oh, that's what she meant.
{16407}{16491}If they're gonna shorten it, they|should call it the "Muse," you know?
{16495}{16561}Short for "museum"|and avoid all the confusion.
{16593}{16734}Yeah, most days the place is packed|with confused, angry baseball fans.
{16738}{16807}Okay. All right,|so I'll take her to the Met.
{16811}{16954}Yeah. Okay. There's this great|rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.
{16966}{17017}You know what?|She loves architecture.
{17021}{17107}You should take a walk down Fifth|to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.
{17111}{17200}And there, there's this great|little pastry shop that she'd love.
{17204}{17267}Jeez. Sounds like you|should be going on this date.
{17281}{17323}But I'm not.
{17353}{17412}- And you know what...?|- Okay, slow down.
{17416}{17495}You're going way too fast.|Okay? Just go back to the Met.
{17499}{17564}So you gotta tell me exactly|what to do there.
{17568}{17628}When you walk into the museum,|take a right, okay?
{17632}{17670}That's the antiquities wing.
{17674}{17753}Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,|up to the Byzantine Empire.
{17824}{17916}Okay. So I walk in the door|and make a right.
{18227}{18299}I have a weird feeling about|this place. How do I know...
{18303}{18400}...they won't secretly videotape me|and put it all over the Internet?
{18434}{18534}Because, honey, and I mean this|in the sweetest way possible...
{18538}{18597}...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.
{18634}{18676}Mr. Bing? Here you are.
{18680}{18752}Go into that room and deposit|your specimen into the container.
{18756}{18791}Deposit my specimen?
{18795}{18880}I usually have to call a 900 number|for that kind of talk.
{18981}{19027}Thanks. Got it.
{19045}{19101}All right. Honey, my tests|are down the hall.
{19105}{19182}- Are you sure you're gonna be okay?|- Yeah, I guess.
{19186}{19255}Look, I know this is embarrassing,|but nobody cares.
{19259}{19326}No one here even knows you.
{19360}{19456}Oh, my God!
{19534}{19564}Oh, come on!
{19779}{19832}How great is this?
{19837}{19908}We're probably fertile.|Let's go home.
{19974}{20010}Why are you here?
{20014}{20093}Sid and I are trying again|and we had trouble last time...
{20097}{20189}No, no, no. I mean, why?|Why is she here?
{20198}{20306}Oh, someone's a little cranky today|because they have to do it in a cup.
{20310}{20372}Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.
{20441}{20486}What?
{20553}{20661}This was fun. But I've got|an invasive vaginal exam to get to.
{20696}{20783}I'd love to stay|but I've got a hot date.
{20787}{20885}Please go. Just let me know|if you need a hand.
{21012}{21077}I think it just fell off.
{21209}{21260}Hello, "ja".
{21300}{21365}It's time for your massage, "ja"?
{21369}{21419}Put your face in the hole.
{21480}{21560}A Swedish massage|from a real Swedish person.
{21564}{21630}Okay, then I'm Swedish.
{21681}{21738}So, what's your name?
{21742}{21809}It's a normal Swedish name.
{21813}{21853}Ikea.
{21896}{21969}- Wow. What an interesting name.|- Yeah.
{21973}{22050}- You know, l...|- Time for your scalp massage.
{22097}{22169}Wow. I really love your...
{22220}{22312}- Is something wrong?|- No, it's just...
{22316}{22366}It just feels so good...
{22370}{22413}...Ikea.
{22438}{22538}Hey, say, you'll know this.|What's the capital of Sweden?
{22573}{22608}Stockholm.
{22618}{22681}Damn. I wish I knew|if that was right.
{22730}{22825}Note the painterly lines|and subtle impasto on this canvas.
{22834}{22895}Monet painted quickly,|and usually outdoors...
{22899}{22999}...as his elusive subject|was light itself.
{23045}{23130}Now, do you have any idea|what you just said?
{23201}{23300}No, no. My mouth says the words,|my brain is thinking "monster trucks."
{23358}{23409}Now, remember,|when you get to the museum...
{23413}{23509}...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.|I just...
{23513}{23622}- I wrote that out phonetically for you.|- Phonetically?
{23643}{23725}Yeah, that means...|We just don't have time for this.
{23729}{23842}I gotta say, I'm really impressed you|were able to memorize all this so quickly.
{23853}{23908}I'm an actor.|I can memorize anything.
{23913}{23951}Last week on "Days", I had to say:
{23955}{24011}"Frontal temporal|zygomatic craniotomy."
{24015}{24110}- Wow. What does that mean?|- No idea.
{24114}{24195}But the guy I said it to|dies in the next scene...
{24199}{24269}...so I guess it means,|"You'll get eaten by a bear."
{24363}{24400}Okay.
{24419}{24491}- So let's move on to the Renaissance.|- Okay.
{24515}{24575}Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...
{24579}{24653}...to highlight the anguish|of the central figure.
{24657}{24699}Touch it. It's really bumpy.
{24734}{24844}No, no, no. No ad-libbing. And, dude,|you can't touch the paintings.
{24848}{24878}- Come on.|- No. No!
{25145}{25194}My specimen's in the room.
{25198}{25300}I just want to thank whoever knocked|on the door while I was in there.
{25304}{25355}Really helped speed the process along.
{25428}{25492}Janice, you're not gone?
{25521}{25552}Sid is still in his room.
{25556}{25661}I don't allow porn at home,|so this is like a vacation for him.
{25695}{25762}So did you do it?|Did you make your deposit?
{25766}{25869}- Yeah. The hard part's over.|- That's not the hard part, honey.
{25873}{25982}The hard part's what comes next.|Aren't you worried about the results?
{25987}{26046}I haven't even thought|about the results.
{26050}{26106}I just assumed everything|would be okay.
{26110}{26165}Well, you know what? It probably is.
{26172}{26207}But what if it's not okay?
{26211}{26288}I mean, what if there's a reason|we can't have a baby?
{26292}{26372}Chandler. Look, you and Monica|are meant to have children.
{26376}{26425}I'm sure it's gonna be just fine.
{26464}{26591}Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. I can't|believe I didn't even think of that.
{26595}{26705}I guess I was so worried about|having to come here and do that.
{26709}{26765}You can do it|in a Taco Bell parking lot...
{26769}{26829}...but you can't do it|at a doctor's office?
{26885}{26940}It was a Wendy's!
{27172}{27287}And that's the Swedish national anthem.|Thank you for asking.
{27316}{27372}Wow, lkea.
{27388}{27445}What a rich culture.
{27449}{27516}You know what?|I have a friend who's a masseuse.
{27520}{27609}- Oh? "Ja", "ja"?|- "Ja". She's not very good, though.
{27738}{27823}- And why do you think that is?|- I don't know.
{27827}{27904}Maybe it's because she's got|such callousy fingers...
{27908}{27972}...from playing crummy guitar.
{28159}{28250}Or maybe she has trouble|loosening your knots...
{28254}{28337}...because you're such|a high-maintenance tight-ass.
{28341}{28384}- Phoebe!|- You know it's me?
{28388}{28442}Well, for like a half an hour!
{28446}{28514}Man, you can lie about Sweden!
{28552}{28591}How can you come here?
{28595}{28680}- Why didn't you tell me you work here?|- I don't have to tell you everything!
{28684}{28768}You do if you're gonna make me feel|guilty for getting a free massage.
{28776}{28826}Tip's not included.
{28862}{28918}Why did you lie to me|about working here?
{28922}{29025}Because I was ashamed, okay?|I sold out for the cash.
{29029}{29155}And they give me benefits, like medical|and dental and a four-oh-wunk.
{29282}{29399}But, you know, you pay a price.|Now I'm this corporate stooge...
{29403}{29458}...and punching a clock...
{29462}{29507}...and paying taxes!
{29528}{29598}Phoebe, honey,|if you hate it so much...
{29602}{29692}...you should walk out there|right now and quit.
{29699}{29759}Be true to what you believe in.
{29763}{29850}Honey, you have principles,|and I so admire that.
{29854}{29907}I don't have any.
{29949}{30021}You know what? You're right.|I am gonna quit.
{30025}{30115}- It's time I took my life back.|- Good for you, Pheebs.
{30193}{30309}If you guys have microphones in|there too, I didn't mean any of that.
{30325}{30370}I love you.
{30435}{30541}Got you!|Die! Die! Die!
{30568}{30671}Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.
{30733}{30779}Hey, how was the Met?
{30783}{30833}The museum was amazing.
{30837}{30894}Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?
{30898}{30950}Not so much, no.
{30954}{31019}He had clearly memorized|all this stuff to say...
{31023}{31089}...and some of it didn't|even make any sense.
{31108}{31150}- What do you mean?|- Well, for one...
{31154}{31225}...he was talking about paintings|that were nowhere around.
{31292}{31401}Wait a minute. When you guys walked|into the Met, did you go to the right?
{31405}{31500}- No. No, we went to the left.|- Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.
{31556}{31642}Still, it seems like you guys|are having a great time together.
{31660}{31726}Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.
{31780}{31805}What?
{31848}{31893}Actually, Joey's your friend...
{31897}{31960}...and you don't know me that well.|It'd be weird.
{31968}{32033}Well, I mean, a little.|But no, what? Go on.
{32037}{32062}Well...
{32089}{32176}I'm thinking that maybe Joey|isn't the right guy for me right now.
{32180}{32257}You know, maybe I should|be with someone...
{32306}{32396}...I have more in common with.|You know what I mean?
{32428}{32466}Yeah.
{32526}{32586}Yeah, but you know what?
{32613}{32686}I think you should give Joey a chance.
{32690}{32734}I mean, he's a great guy.
{32738}{32800}And sure, he doesn't know|that much about art...
{32804}{32869}...but you can always talk about|that with someone else.
{32873}{32927}- I guess that's true.|- Lf you think about it...
{32932}{33031}...he memorized all that stuff because|he thought it was important to you.
{33035}{33100}You know, that's the kind of guy|Joey is.
{33104}{33165}He is very sweet.
{33169}{33209}Plus, he is hot!
{33241}{33325}That was gonna be my next argument.
{33381}{33431}- You ready?|- Yeah. Let's go.
{33435}{33460}Wow!
{33502}{33554}- Thanks, Ross.|- Yeah.
{33582}{33669}Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.|You hooked me up.
{33712}{33743}Glad I could help, man.
{33748}{33845}Some of the stuff wasn't where you said|it would be, but I made it work.
{34092}{34193}It is not okay that I'm aroused|by this now.
{34280}{34305}Hello?
{34317}{34388}Oh. Hi, Dr. Connelly.
{34397}{34454}No. Well, she's not here...
{34458}{34495}...but I can tell her.
{34499}{34565}Should I be sitting down for this?
{34932}{34994}Well, so, what does that mean?
{35111}{35168}Okay. Okay, thank you.
{35172}{35211}Thanks.
{35362}{35397}Hey, sweetie.
{35419}{35455}Dr. Connelly just called.
{35459}{35515}With good news?|Of course it's not good news.
{35519}{35563}You said, "Dr. Connelly just called."
{35567}{35640}If it was good, you'd have said,|"Dr. Connelly just called!"
{35644}{35696}So, what is it? Is it...?
{35700}{35797}Is there a problem? Is there|a problem with me, or with you?
{35839}{35892}Actually, it's both of us.
{35925}{35962}What?
{35966}{36042}Apparently, my sperm|have low motility...
{36046}{36163}...and you have|an inhospitable environment.
{36359}{36409}Well, what does that mean?
{36414}{36498}It means that my guys won't|get off their Barcaloungers...
{36502}{36591}...and you have a uterus that is|prepared to kill the ones that do.
{36658}{36712}- It means...|- Wait, Chandler.
{36814}{36882}It means that we can keep trying...
{36897}{36986}...but there's a good chance|this may never happen for us.
{37123}{37170}Oh, my God.
{37221}{37261}I'm sorry.
{37275}{37319}I'm sorry too.
{37407}{37440}Well...
{37453}{37525}...we're gonna figure this out.
{37598}{37640}I know.
{38032}{38123}- Good morning, Phoebe.|- Good morning, receptionist.
{38127}{38212}Here's your schedule for the day.|Your first client is in Room 1.
{38229}{38318}"Rachel Green."|Son of a bitch! She came back?
{38514}{38595}Are you ready|for your Scottish massage?
{38603}{38657}Put your face in the hole, lassie!

{110}{167}Oh, that feels so good.
{171}{264}Oh, lucky me.|Coffee and a live sex show.
{271}{309}- I'm sorry, what?|- I'm sorry.
{313}{399}- Nothing. I was just reading to Emma.|- From "Cosmo"?
{448}{508}Yeah. Yeah, it's:
{512}{584}"Climax Your Way to Better Skin."
{608}{687}So I have to go shopping today,|which is my least favorite thing.
{691}{743}I'm so bad at picking out clothes.
{747}{847}So you need someone who knows|fashion to tell you what looks good.
{851}{900}Not me. Not me. Not me.
{904}{970}- Oh, hey, Rach?|- Yeah?
{985}{1063}- Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?|- Oh, well...
{1067}{1125}- I'm sure you have better things to do.|- You kidding?
{1129}{1194}Rachel loves to shop,|and she has great taste.
{1198}{1276}She's the one that taught me not|to wear white after Labor Day...
{1280}{1388}...and to always, always, always put|on underwear when trying on clothes.
{1431}{1496}If you have the time,|I'd really appreciate the help.
{1500}{1554}Okay. Yeah, let's shop.
{1558}{1668}Okay, you are gonna come back|with some very classy clothes.
{1672}{1726}And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!
{1768}{1840}Okay, great. All right, bye.
{1844}{1894}Pain in the ass!
{1899}{1988}- That's off, right?|- What's the matter, Pheebs?
{1992}{2091}Mike's sister just invited me to|a party tonight and he's gonna be there.
{2095}{2204}She was like, "Don't worry. I asked him|and he's totally okay with seeing you."
{2208}{2300}So now I have to go so he'll think|that I'm totally okay with seeing him.
{2304}{2372}- Which you're not. You're hung up on him.|- Exactly.
{2376}{2458}You want him to eat his heart out,|so you have to look fabulous.
{2462}{2521}I didn't even think about that.
{2533}{2586}Sexual politics!
{2598}{2664}Pheebs, I'm taking Charlie shopping.
{2668}{2745}- Come and I'll help you find something.|- That'd be great.
{2749}{2882}Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,|trying on slutty lingerie together.
{2905}{3011}- That's not what we're gonna do.|- Why'd you ruin it? Who was I hurting?

{4032}{4114}Fortunately, she has|a very pretty face.
{4210}{4348}I still can't believe this. My uterus is|an inhospitable environment?
{4352}{4425}I've always tried so hard|to be a good hostess.
{4445}{4497}I can't believe my sperm|have low motility.
{4501}{4613}While I was growing up, they sure|seemed to be in a hurry to get places.
{4628}{4658}- Hi there.|- Hi.
{4662}{4736}I'm sorry there wasn't better news|from your tests last week...
{4740}{4806}...but I wanted to talk to you|about your options.
{4810}{4835}Okay.
{4839}{4937}Even though your chances of conceiving|through natural means aren't great...
{4941}{5006}...you never know,|so keep having sex on a regular basis.
{5010}{5059}Oh, damn it!
{5095}{5186}Don't worry.|After a while, you'll tune it out.
{5202}{5294}Given your situation, the options|with the greatest chances for success...
{5298}{5396}...would be surrogacy|or insemination using a sperm donor.
{5470}{5573}If you feel that neither of those is|right for you, you could always adopt.
{5577}{5617}Is that a hint?
{5621}{5757}Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,|but we don't want you to be our child.
{5864}{5932}Wow! Talk about|an inhospitable environment.
{5975}{6078}Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up|Phoebe and go shopping?
{6082}{6145}- Let's do it.|- All right, have a good time.
{6157}{6211}Not gonna find any clothes in there.
{6242}{6272}- Hey, you guys.|- Hi.
{6276}{6394}Guess who's up for keynote speaker|at the National Paleontology Conference?
{6398}{6440}- Chris Bailey?|- Yeah, right.
{6444}{6554}When was the last time he made|a submission deadline for an abstract?
{6648}{6680}Why are you laughing?
{6684}{6771}Just seeing what it'd be like|to be a paleontologist.
{6780}{6814}It's fun. Yeah.
{6842}{6882}So you're up for keynote speaker?
{6886}{6929}- Who's deciding?|- Professor Sherman.
{6933}{7017}- I'm meeting with him today.|- He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
{7021}{7072}I think I know how to dazzle him.
{7076}{7171}You're not gonna to do|a magic trick, are you?
{7187}{7212}No.
{7428}{7489}- Hey, guys.|- I want to ask you something.
{7493}{7570}I may get to speak|at this paleontology convention.
{7574}{7657}If I do, I'd love for you guys|to come and hear me.
{7661}{7783}I think I can safely say that we all have|family issues, work and/or are sick.
{7818}{7868}- It's in Barbados.|- But you come first.
{7872}{7908}I'm there.
{7930}{7962}- We'll see you guys.|- Bye.
{7966}{7991}See you.
{8055}{8143}- So how did it go at the fertility clinic?|- Not as much fun as last time.
{8147}{8230}Apparently, you only get porn|if you're giving a sperm sample.
{8260}{8295}So, what did the doctor say?
{8299}{8388}There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt|her whole life of carrying a child...
{8392}{8486}...and she just felt that watching|a surrogate would be too hard for her.
{8490}{8543}- So you're ruling out surrogacy?|- Yeah.
{8547}{8595}So I don't have to learn|what that means?
{8626}{8697}Aside from adoption, the only|other choice is insemination...
{8701}{8750}...so we're talking about sperm donors.
{8754}{8843}Enough said. I'm there for you, man.|Where is she, upstairs?
{8901}{8940}How do you feel about all this?
{8944}{9064}I wish there was an easier way for us|to have a child, but there isn't one.
{9073}{9159}Come on, Ross, be a good guy.|Step up and do it.
{9186}{9211}What?
{9270}{9343}What?! No!|I'm not gonna give them Ben!
{9456}{9565}The data we're receiving|from MRI scans and DNA testing...
{9569}{9618}...of these fossils are staggering.
{9651}{9728}I mean, we've been accepting|Leakey's dates as a given.
{9732}{9806}But if they're off|by even a 100,000 years or so...
{9810}{9902}...then you can just throw|most of our assumptions...
{9906}{9961}...you know, right in the trash.
{9965}{10063}So, what I'm saying is...
{10069}{10111}Is that...
{10118}{10231}Is that repercussions could be huge.
{10235}{10325}I mean, not just in paleontology,|but if you think about it...
{10329}{10430}...in evolutionary biology,|genetics, geology.
{10434}{10497}I mean, truly, the mind boggles.
{10593}{10653}Well, that's not what you want.
{10772}{10834}- Incentive for Men?|- I'll take some of that.
{10838}{10878}- Pheebs, that's for men.|- I know.
{10882}{10921}When I go to the party later...
{10925}{11021}...Mike will know I'm over him|because I'll smell like another guy.
{11076}{11101}Okay.
{11114}{11189}Oh, good, I'm dating|a Russian cabdriver.
{11206}{11295}Seriously, does anyone buy this?|I smell like beets.
{11348}{11453}I really like those jackets with the|shoulder pads in them. Where are those?
{11457}{11534}On Melanie Griffith in "Working Girl".
{11563}{11627}I think what you want is over here.
{11635}{11699}See, I told you I needed someone.
{11703}{11784}By the way, as a thank you,|I would really love to take you out.
{11788}{11866}- Really?|- Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.
{11870}{11924}- You want to come?|- Oh, I can't.
{11939}{12000}Because I've seen them.
{12054}{12113}You've seen all the movies?
{12117}{12196}Yeah. I'm a big fan.
{12203}{12235}Of the movies.
{12239}{12290}You know, motion pictures.
{12294}{12327}The talkies.
{12375}{12433}Rach, will you come with me|to a dressing room?
{12437}{12462}- Sure.|- Okay.
{12466}{12512}Maybe we could do something else.
{12516}{12623}You know, that depends on what it is.|I've done a lot of stuff.
{12836}{12914}So, what were you doing out there?|Do you not like Charlie?
{12918}{13013}She's okay. I don't know, I just don't|get a really good vibe from her.
{13017}{13073}- Why?|- I don't know.
{13077}{13200}You know, just the way|she waltzed in here all smart...
{13208}{13244}...and tall, you know...
{13248}{13332}...and just swept Joey off his feet.|Nobody else has a chance.
{13344}{13369}Who else?
{13389}{13414}Anybody.
{13440}{13465}You.
{13484}{13509}Me.
{13514}{13569}You know, Monica's mom.
{13624}{13658}You like Joey?!
{13662}{13688}Phoebe!
{13692}{13799}All right, look, I do.|I have a little thing for him. Just...
{13816}{13866}- Oh, my God.|- It's just physical.
{13870}{13977}I have it totally under control, okay?|It's just when I see them together...
{13981}{14057}...sometimes, I just get a little jealous.
{14061}{14149}Wow. Isn't that ironic|that he liked you, and now you like...?
{14153}{14189}I get it!
{14219}{14271}All right, as long|as it's under control.
{14275}{14348}You can't do anything about it.|He's already dating her.
{14352}{14411}She is a nice person.|That wouldn't be right.
{14415}{14476}I know, I know.|So it's just not a big deal.
{14480}{14534}- So can we keep this between us?|- Sure.
{14538}{14637}Great, because I gotta get out of here.|The smell of beets is killing me.
{14774}{14855}Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
{14984}{15011}- Hi, honey.|- Hey.
{15015}{15089}I brought a friend home for dinner.|This is Zack from work.
{15093}{15172}Oh, of course. It's so nice|to see you again, Zack.
{15176}{15240}- You too.|- You guys haven't actually met before.
{15244}{15289}But, boy, you're both polite.
{15293}{15341}Have a seat. I'll get you a beer.
{15345}{15376}- I got it.|- Thanks.
{15461}{15551}- So Zack's pretty nice, huh?|- Yeah, I guess.
{15566}{15655}So how would you like to have a baby|that's half yours and half his?
{15750}{15775}Excuse me?
{15779}{15862}We're talking about sperm donors,|and Zack may be the guy.
{15866}{15987}Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,|he's athletic. I mean, he's sperm-tastic!
{16038}{16129}Chandler, this is crazy.|Well, what did you even say to him?
{16133}{16212}"Come up. Meet my wife.|Give us your sperm."
{16227}{16305}I invited him to dinner so you'd get|a chance to get to know him.
{16309}{16387}With a sperm bank, you never|meet the guy, get to check him out.
{16391}{16449}- Chandler!|- I'm telling you, he's great.
{16453}{16553}I mean, even if my sperm worked fine,|I think he'd be the way to go.
{16587}{16636}I'm not going to be a part of this.
{16640}{16744}You can't bring some random guy home|and expect him to be our sperm donor.
{16748}{16773}Okay.
{16821}{16861}- Zack?|- Thanks.
{16876}{16946}Do you have a coaster?|I don't want to make a ring.
{16950}{17002}Tell me about yourself, Zack.
{17108}{17194}Oh, God, do you think she heard?|Lt'd be so bad if she heard.
{17198}{17296}Maybe she didn't hear. I'll go into that|dressing room and talk. You stay here.
{17300}{17347}- See if you can hear me.|- Okay, great.
{17417}{17496}Oh, thank God,|I can't hear a word that you're saying.
{17500}{17611}- I didn't say anything yet.|- Well, get back in there and talk.
{17643}{17668}I'm Rachel.
{17672}{17763}It's so annoying when I put Emma|on the phone to talk with my friends.
{17773}{17798}What?
{17818}{17885}Well, some things are just hard|to say to your face.
{17920}{18017}Okay, well, I heard that.|Which means that she heard it too.
{18028}{18116}- We have a problem.|- Oh, what are we gonna do?
{18120}{18164}Just be honest with her.
{18174}{18211}Oh, my God!
{18215}{18271}It is annoying when parents|put babies on the phone.
{18275}{18323}All right, enough out of you!
{18487}{18576}- Hello?|- I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
{18580}{18648}No, she went shopping with Rachel.|Why? What's up?
{18652}{18747}I'm meeting with Professor Sherman|about my being the keynote speaker.
{18751}{18808}- How's it going?|- It could be better.
{18875}{18911}He fell asleep.
{18915}{18987}What? But I already bought|my ticket to Bermuda!
{19021}{19088}- Barbados.|- Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.
{19129}{19167}You have to get that job.
{19171}{19226}What am I supposed to do?|He's out cold.
{19230}{19295}In fact, he was just talking|in his sleep before...
{19299}{19404}...and evidently he wants someone|named Fran to "spank him harder."
{19431}{19487}- Well, just wake him up.|- I can't.
{19491}{19604}If he realizes that I'm the one who|put him to sleep, I won't get the job.
{19608}{19636}{y:i}That's a tough one.
{19640}{19710}Oh, wait a minute.|This happened to me before.
{19714}{19840}Yeah, I was auditioning for a play,|and the producer fell asleep. L...
{19844}{19895}No, wait a minute.
{19899}{19937}It was me who fell asleep.
{19958}{20058}I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about|a chase scene once in a while?
{20133}{20218}- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.|- I'm gonna go wash up first.
{20222}{20247}Thanks.
{20321}{20435}What do you think? I want his genes|for my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.
{20445}{20525}Okay, there's enthusiastic,|and there's just plain gay.
{20572}{20628}- You don't like him.|- I think he's fine.
{20632}{20686}But we don't know|anything real about him.
{20690}{20794}- I wish we could get more information.|- All right, just follow my lead.
{20813}{20898}- You guys have a great place here.|- Thanks. I'm crazy about our place.
{20902}{20945}Hey, speaking of crazy...
{20984}{21068}...do you have a history|of mental illness in the family?
{21086}{21201}No. Although, I did have an uncle|who voted for Dukakis.
{21215}{21287}That's really not the kind of thing|we're looking for.
{21326}{21351}Okay.
{21381}{21452}So tell me, how'd you guys meet?
{21456}{21535}Oh, friends first, drunk in London,|you know the story.
{21539}{21580}I've got a better question for you:
{21592}{21669}Do you or any of your blood relatives|have diabetes?
{21727}{21752}No.
{21762}{21848}Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?
{21903}{21969}You guys don't have people|for dinner a lot, huh?
{21981}{22030}We're just making conversation.
{22034}{22117}Yeah, well, okay.|I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny.
{22121}{22187}You know what's not funny?|Male pattern baldness.
{22280}{22364}You guys have shown a lot of interest|in me tonight, and I'm flattered...
{22368}{22423}...and quite frankly, a little frightened.
{22437}{22482}Can we just talk about something else?
{22486}{22520}- Sure.|- All right.
{22539}{22569}This ravioli's delicious.
{22574}{22675}I notice you're enjoying that ravioli|with a beautiful set of teeth.
{22679}{22724}Did you have braces as a child?
{22730}{22787}- No, I didn't.|- Yes!
{22860}{22920}We're teeth people, Zack.
{23040}{23124}Let's just do it. Let's just go|over there and see if she heard.
{23128}{23155}- Good plan.|- Okay.
{23180}{23268}- What? Where are you going?|- Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.
{23272}{23352}I don't have time|for your childish games, okay?
{23356}{23418}I still have to find something|incredible to wear...
{23422}{23494}...so I can beat Mike|at "Who's More Over Who"!
{23654}{23713}- Where have you been?|- Trying on clothes.
{23717}{23833}Oh, really? In the dressing room?|Well, that's so weird.
{23837}{23963}Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.|Gosh, it's just such a small world.
{23967}{24028}Rachel, I heard you|two guys whispering.
{24032}{24107}Oh, God, you did, you heard.|Okay, look, let me explain.
{24111}{24159}There's nothing to explain.|I heard you.
{24163}{24195}Phoebe likes Joey.
{24314}{24339}Yeah.
{24389}{24456}I don't understand it.|I mean, Phoebe likes Joey...
{24460}{24531}...and then she's here to buy a dress|to impress another guy?
{24535}{24650}Yeah, that's Phoebe. That's Phoebe.|You know, she just wants them all.
{24654}{24723}It's, like, she's nympho.
{24760}{24791}- Wow!|- Yeah.
{24795}{24887}You know, by the way, I heard you|tell her not to do anything.
{24891}{24995}Thanks for sticking up for me.|God, you are such a nice person.
{25027}{25052}I try.
{25963}{26085}Oh, my God, you really want me|to be the keynote speaker?
{26105}{26148}Thank you!
{26202}{26243}You're welcome.
{26547}{26595}Wow! You look...
{26617}{26671}...stop-eating hot!
{26709}{26774}Which is like the highest level|of hotness.
{26778}{26882}Okay, are you sure? Because I am|really dreading going to this party.
{26886}{26911}Then don't go.
{26915}{27005}Mike knows I'm coming. If I don't|show up, he'll think it's because of him...
{27009}{27124}...and then I'm gonna lose face.|That's a very serious thing in my culture.
{27149}{27259}All right, then you go to that party,|and you pretend to be over Mike.
{27263}{27348}Afterward, you come to my place|and I'll get you good and drunk.
{27352}{27394}You got it. Okay.
{27398}{27459}But not on the wine|that you made, okay?
{27463}{27557}Because I just don't want to go back|to the emergency room.
{27786}{27822}David?
{27826}{27864}Phoebe! Hi.
{27868}{27926}- Oh, my God!|- Hi.
{27942}{27998}Wow! You look unbelievable.
{28002}{28044}Oh, yeah, well...
{28098}{28131}What are you doing here?
{28135}{28206}Well, I'm back from Minsk.|Permanently.
{28210}{28239}Well, what happened?
{28243}{28287}Remember how I was trying|to achieve...
{28291}{28360}...the positronic distillation|of subatomic particles?
{28364}{28399}Yeah.
{28403}{28488}Well, after eight years of research,|I discovered...
{28492}{28552}...that it can't be done.
{28572}{28597}Well...
{28616}{28681}...great that you're back. How are you?
{28685}{28730}- Good. Good. Life is good.|- Good.
{28734}{28791}Well, I'm seeing someone.
{28832}{28868}- Good for you.|- Yeah.
{28872}{28977}She's also a scientist,|so she's very smart and pretty and...
{28981}{29040}It's actually because of you|that we're together.
{29044}{29113}I mean, I saw what you had|with that Mike guy...
{29117}{29167}...and I just said, "Boy, I want that."
{29182}{29251}- Mike and I broke up.|- You're kidding me.
{29255}{29354}Because I'm not seeing anybody.|I just totally made that up.
{29358}{29407}- Really?|- I don't know why, I'm sorry.
{29411}{29474}I guess I just didn't want|to lose face.
{29481}{29532}I understand.
{29542}{29618}Yeah. Okay. So then, okay...
{29622}{29716}So we're both living in New York,|not seeing anyone.
{29720}{29774}- That's so not like us.|- Yeah, I know.
{29778}{29887}Well, this is probably a stupid question,|seeing that you look like that...
{29891}{29960}...but do you have someplace|that you need to be right now?
{29964}{29989}Well...
{30020}{30045}No.
{30090}{30163}- Well, do you want to get a drink?|- I'd love to.
{30167}{30214}- Great.|- Okay.
{30282}{30334}Do you smell beets?
{30338}{30404}All right, stay upwind of me.
{30457}{30547}Hey, there's Phoebe.|Is that Mike she's with?
{30560}{30612}No, that's David.
{30616}{30682}There's a third guy?
{30693}{30770}Tip of the iceberg.
{30837}{30873}I'm gonna take off now.
{30877}{30938}You're gonna let me go home,|aren't you?
{30949}{30999}Sure you don't want to stay|a little longer?
{31003}{31054}No, I should get home.|I'm kind of tired.
{31058}{31099}Are you always tired?
{31103}{31172}Because that could be|a sign of clinical depression.
{31188}{31279}No, it's tiring to figure out the age|at which all my grandparents died.
{31326}{31374}- I'll see you tomorrow.|- Okay.
{31378}{31403}Bye.
{31438}{31490}I think we found our sperm.
{31514}{31551}He does seem pretty perfect.
{31555}{31612}Yeah? You think so?|Should I ask him?
{31676}{31701}No.
{31705}{31768}Why not? Just because his|great-grandmother was obese?
{31772}{31836}Our kid's gonna get that|from you anyway.
{31891}{31940}No, that's not it.
{31944}{32051}It's just that when we were asking him|all those questions before...
{32055}{32173}...I just realized I don't care if he|is the most perfect guy in the world.
{32177}{32265}- He's not you.|- Yeah, he's better!
{32304}{32357}No, he's not.
{32361}{32465}If I can't get pregnant with you, then|I don't want to get pregnant by him...
{32469}{32507}...or anyone else.
{32540}{32624}- Really? Are you sure?|- Yeah, I'm sure.
{32628}{32686}Thank God, because I|don't wanna do this either.
{32690}{32767}I was just doing it because I thought|that was what you wanted.
{32771}{32857}I'm the husband.|I'm supposed to bring the sperm.
{32884}{32923}That is so sweet.
{32945}{32977}I love you.
{33064}{33115}So you know this leaves us with...
{33133}{33158}Adoption.
{33181}{33223}How do you feel about that?
{33258}{33321}I think I feel okay about it.
{33330}{33413}Actually, I think I feel|really good about it.
{33440}{33465}Me too.
{33479}{33583}I wanna find a baby that needs a home,|and I wanna raise it with you.
{33587}{33676}And I wanna mess it up|in our own specific way.
{33716}{33797}So this is it?|We're really gonna adopt?
{33816}{33841}Yeah.
{33858}{33961}- Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!|- We are gonna be great parents.
{33965}{33995}And it could be soon.
{33999}{34075}I mean, think about it.|Right now, somewhere out there...
{34085}{34143}...our baby could be being conceived.
{34147}{34256}Wait. If we're lucky,|and we're really, really, really quiet...
{34260}{34348}...we may be able to hear|the sound of a condom breaking.
{34485}{34511}Hey, Zack.
{34515}{34567}Hey, Chandler.
{34571}{34615}I wanted to apologize for last night.
{34619}{34676}I got the feeling|we made you uncomfortable.
{34680}{34708}- No, you didn't.|- Really?
{34712}{34753}No, you did.
{34757}{34821}My wife and I have|some boundary issues.
{34825}{34876}Sometimes we ask|inappropriate questions.
{34880}{34918}We're working on it.
{34922}{35002}- Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.|- Thank you.
{35056}{35145}You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning|on keeping her baby, would you?

{110}{174}Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.
{179}{278}That's right. Daddy and Uncle Joey|are going on a trip today.
{284}{393}We're going to a conference in Barbados.|Right? Can you say, "Barbados"?
{398}{444}Barbados.
{493}{588}Okay. I've gotta say, it means so much|to me that you guys are coming...
{593}{657}...all the way over there|to hear me give my speech.
{663}{731}And I have a surprise.|I had to pull some strings...
{736}{856}...but I was able to get everyone passes|to the entire conference. That's right!
{893}{1015}These babies will get you into all|the paleontology lectures and seminars.
{1027}{1118}Do you have anything|that will get us out of them?
{1143}{1213}We're excited to hear the speech,|but the rest of the time...
{1217}{1262}...we're gonna want to do island stuff.
{1268}{1320}David will probably want to hear|a few lectures.
{1326}{1373}- Right, because he's a scientist.|- No, no.
{1379}{1467}He's been in Minsk for eight years.|If he gets too much direct sunlight...
{1472}{1513}...he'll die.
{1519}{1562}- Okay, we'd better go.|- Yeah?
{1567}{1635}- So we'll see you guys tomorrow.|- All right, let's do it.
{1639}{1703}A five-hour flight with Charlie,|have a couple drinks...
{1708}{1767}...get under that blanket|and do what comes natural.
{1773}{1849}It's a blanket, Joe,|not a cloak of invisibility.

{3206}{3359}- Wow, this place is beautiful!|- Look at all these paleontologists!
{3364}{3469}I know. There are gonna be some|pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.
{3483}{3572}- My God, I can't believe you're here!|- I think I've been recognized.
{3577}{3679}- This happens all the time.|- Dr. Geller? I am such a huge fan.
{3685}{3741}That never happens.
{3747}{3851}I've been following your career for years.|I can't wait for your keynote speech.
{3857}{3961}- Wow! This is very flattering.|- I would love your autograph.
{3966}{4017}Well, sure.
{4057}{4090}- "Dear...?"|- Sarah.
{4094}{4220}"Sarah. I dig you."
{4244}{4322}- "Dr. Ross Geller."|- Oh, thank you so much.
{4327}{4428}Sure. Sarah, I'd like you to introduce you|to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.
{4433}{4528}- And this is Joey Tribbiani.|- Are you a paleontologist?
{4534}{4611}No, God, no, no.|I'm an actor.
{4616}{4707}You probably recognize me from a|little show called "The Days of Our Lives."
{4713}{4822}Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives."|There's no "the."
{4884}{5008}Okay, Ross. Boy, you... Yeah.|No, no. I play Dr. Drake Ramoray.
{5013}{5151}- I'm sorry. I don't own a TV.|- You don't own a TV?
{5155}{5217}What's all your furniture pointed at?
{5312}{5345}David, can you help me?
{5349}{5432}I'm trying to explain to Chandler|how a plane stays in the air.
{5437}{5503}Certainly. That's a combination|of Bernoulli's Principle...
{5507}{5575}...and Newton's third law of motion.|- See?
{5580}{5667}Yeah. That's the same as,|"It has something to do with wind."
{5690}{5741}I'm gonna go pick up a few things|for the trip.
{5746}{5838}I should go too. Now, tomorrow do you|want to share a cab to the airport...
{5843}{5881}...or should Mike and I meet you?
{5982}{6062}Mike? Who's Mike?
{6084}{6160}- Mike's your ex-boyfriend.|- That's right!
{6165}{6253}Oh, yeah.|Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.
{6258}{6399}- That's a blast from the past, huh?|- No, it's okay. Honest mistake.
{6405}{6469}It really doesn't mean anything.|I mean, you know...
{6474}{6545}...Monica refers to Chandler as Richard|all the time.
{6604}{6672}- She does?|- Let's get you out of here.
{6790}{6866}Well, at least you took me down|with you.
{6872}{6956}I'm so sorry. I just...|I keep thinking about Mike.
{6962}{7051}I'm crazy about David, and|we're having so much fun together.
{7056}{7155}Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just...|That's gonna go away, right?
{7160}{7208}- Well, I guess. In time.|- Yeah.
{7213}{7283}I mean, my feelings for Richard|are certainly gone.
{7288}{7421}You just did it again. Chandler. Your|feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.
{7464}{7530}Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up|on that Mike, huh?
{7535}{7607}I wouldn't read too much into it.
{7620}{7688}Still, a girl calls you|by her ex-boyfriend's name...
{7692}{7765}...that's not a good thing, right?|- Let me stop you there.
{7771}{7881}Because I think I see where this is going.|I'm not very good at giving advice.
{7886}{7954}See, if you want advice,|go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...
{7958}{8086}...for advice about pizza toppings|or a burning sensation when you pee.
{8112}{8217}I'm sorry, I just wish there|was something I could do, you know?
{8224}{8309}- Well, you know Phoebe...|- Seriously, we're gonna do this?
{8315}{8401}I'm sorry, I just wish I could make her|forget about Mike already.
{8408}{8521}- Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?|- Because his penis was too big.
{8614}{8696}I'm sorry. That's the kind of thing I do.
{8721}{8795}They broke up because Mike|didn't want to get married.
{8799}{8861}What if you let Phoebe know|you'd be open to marriage?
{8875}{8967}That's great. That's great.|I'll propose to her.
{8973}{9006}What?
{9012}{9068}I was probably going to do it|at some point.
{9074}{9138}- No, I didn't mean now.|- Well, why not? It's brilliant.
{9144}{9212}"Goodbye, Mike.|We'll see you at the wedding, fella.
{9216}{9285}Well, we probably won't invite you|to the wedding, but..."
{9290}{9374}- Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.|- Well, you're welcome.
{9380}{9425}Glad I could help.
{9455}{9534}- How do you think I should propose?|- I'm pretending to read here.
{9539}{9578}I'm sorry.
{9666}{9732}Yeah. How you doing?|Hey, how are you?
{9790}{9858}You said you were gonna wear a thong.|Where's the thong?
{9879}{9990}I didn't mean a thong.|I meant thongs.
{10010}{10078}You really should have been|more clear about that.
{10191}{10257}You're never gonna guess|who I just saw downstairs.
{10275}{10315}Britney Spears!
{10321}{10389}Yeah.|She never misses these conferences.
{10397}{10479}- No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!|- Oh, my God!
{10484}{10521}- I know!|- Did you talk to him?
{10525}{10603}Oh, yeah. What am I gonna say|to Kenneth Schwartz?
{10608}{10707}You could say, "Hey, Kenny,|how come you're not Britney Spears?"
{10715}{10779}- You ready to go?|- You're gonna go now?
{10784}{10875}- I thought we could hang out.|- I can't. I have seminars all day.
{10880}{10930}I promised Ross|I'd look at his speech.
{10943}{11081}But maybe we could have dinner later?|Out on the balcony? Lt'll be romantic.
{11086}{11138}Will you wear a thong?
{11144}{11185}I will if you will.
{11222}{11280}You got yourself a very weird deal.
{11340}{11400}I'm good. I have dinner plans.
{11431}{11484}- So you gonna be okay?|- Yeah, yeah.
{11489}{11586}I got tons of stuff I could do.|I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.
{11592}{11633}Joe, have you looked outside?
{11655}{11695}No. Why?
{11760}{11817}- Oh, man.|- There's an indoor pool.
{11822}{11859}- You could swim there.|- Yeah.
{11864}{11948}I wasn't gonna swim.|I was gonna dig a hole.
{12056}{12129}That Mike thing was interesting.|I don't know what's gonna happen...
{12134}{12244}...with Phoebe and David.|- I do. Want a hint, huh?
{12254}{12287}I do.
{12327}{12376}I do.
{12387}{12457}Okay, I'm sensing this is|some kind of wordplay...
{12462}{12535}...because you are pink|with barely controlled glee.
{12549}{12660}- David's gonna propose to Phoebe.|- What? Why?
{12679}{12745}Because we were talking about ways|he could beat Mike...
{12750}{12804}...and I told him Phoebe wanted|to get married.
{12810}{12855}Chandler, we have talked about this.
{12860}{12931}You are not supposed to give|people advice!
{12969}{13033}Couldn't you have made|some inappropriate joke?
{13038}{13098}I did! A penis one!
{13109}{13168}Just so I know, what was so wrong|about what I said?
{13173}{13226}They've only been going out|for a few weeks.
{13232}{13335}Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.|I mean, she'll say no...
{13339}{13425}...David's heart will be broken,|it'll be too hard for them to recover...
{13431}{13499}...and then Phoebe will end up|alone again.
{13512}{13571}Man, that's some bad advice.
{13747}{13811}Oh, hey.|Thank God. You guys are here.
{13817}{13893}- What's going on?|- Everything is upside-down here.
{13898}{14039}It rains all day long and nobody|watches TV, and Ross is famous.
{14091}{14132}I don't want to alarm anybody...
{14137}{14221}...but Monica's hair is twice as big|as it was when we landed.
{14232}{14290}Okay. When I go places|with high humidity...
{14295}{14376}...it gets a little extra body, okay?
{14381}{14482}That's why our honeymoon photos|look like me and Diana Ross.
{14486}{14529}I'll show you guys where to check in.
{14533}{14605}Oh, honey? Can you make sure|we get a king-size bed?
{14610}{14723}Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, and|see if they have a heart-shaped one.
{14729}{14801}And with mirrors on the ceiling.
{14805}{14894}And make sure our room|isn't next to theirs.
{14899}{14976}Oh, you guys are so lucky|you're here with people.
{14982}{15033}You know, it's just|such a romantic place.
{15038}{15151}I just wish I could share it with a guy.
{15188}{15238}- Not Joey.|- Not Joey. No.
{15243}{15364}- I was just lusting after Chandler.|- Yeah, right.
{15427}{15534}So... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.
{15540}{15575}Tonight?
{15583}{15666}Isn't an engagement ring|supposed to have a diamond?
{15684}{15746}Oh, there it is.
{15752}{15855}Yes, well, being a failed scientist doesn't|pay quite as well as you might think.
{15859}{15936}That's one-seventieth of a carat.
{15952}{16034}And the clarity is quite poor.
{16080}{16121}Nice.
{16155}{16230}- Monica, can I talk to you for a second?|- Okay.
{16236}{16279}David's gonna propose|to Phoebe tonight.
{16284}{16353}See what happens|when you give people advice?
{16370}{16444}- Well, I hope you told him not to.|- That would be advice!
{16469}{16519}Okay, fine. I'll handle this.
{16584}{16629}- Phoebe?|- Yeah?
{16642}{16741}- I need to talk to you.|- Are you leaving the Supremes?
{16890}{17020}Okay, my husband just gave|your boyfriend some very bad advice.
{17025}{17077}David's gonna propose to you tonight.
{17092}{17141}Wow, really?
{17167}{17216}That's fantastic!
{17238}{17306}What? Are you serious?|You want to marry him?
{17311}{17383}- What about Mike?|- Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?
{17387}{17439}Let's just gag him and handcuff him...
{17444}{17499}...and force him down the aisle, okay?
{17504}{17568}I can just see it.|"Mike, do you take Phoebe?"
{17633}{17716}You know? It's every girl's dream.
{17733}{17805}Do you really think marrying|someone else is the right answer?
{17810}{17911}Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?|I love Mike... David!
{17934}{18002}David! I love David.
{18007}{18079}Don't look at me that way,|Roseanne Roseannadanna.
{18179}{18291}"By using CT scans and computer|imaging, we can, in a very real way...
{18296}{18406}...bring the Mesozoic Era|into the 21 st century."
{18453}{18535}It's great. You'll be the hit|of the conference.
{18541}{18578}It'll be even better tomorrow...
{18583}{18645}...because I won't be constantly|interrupted by Joey...
{18650}{18719}...checking to see if they put|chocolates on my pillow yet.
{18819}{18871}- Hey, guys.|- The chocolates aren't here.
{18876}{18922}Damn it!
{18927}{18981}Ross just read me his speech.|It's fantastic.
{18987}{19065}Oh, is it on the computer?|Because I'd love to give it a read.
{19070}{19140}If you want to check your e-mail,|just ask.
{19145}{19196}What? May I?
{19262}{19379}What's with the rain, Geller? I mean,|when I signed up for dino week...
{19384}{19453}...nobody said anything|about it being monsoon season.
{19459}{19544}- The wet season is June to December.|- It's not the time, Charlie.
{19558}{19603}Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!
{19608}{19685}What, did someone outbid you|for the teapot?
{19739}{19811}Secret teapot.
{19815}{19875}Your computer. I don't know what...|Everything's gone.
{19881}{19930}- What do you mean?|- Must be a virus.
{19935}{19981}I think it erased your hard drive.
{19986}{20041}What? Oh, my God. What did you do?
{20046}{20102}Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail|and I opened it.
{20107}{20196}- Why? Why would you open it?|- Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus."
{20222}{20292}- What did it say?|- "Nude..."
{20342}{20387}"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."
{20417}{20474}- I'm so sorry.|- What am I gonna do?
{20479}{20528}- My speech is gone!|- It's not gone.
{20533}{20597}I'm sure you printed out a copy.|You have a hard copy?
{20601}{20640}No, I don't!
{20667}{20753}Well, you must be pretty mad|at yourself right now.
{20976}{21031}- It's really gone?|- Yep.
{21036}{21106}I'd like to thank you guys|for coming down here...
{21111}{21183}...to complain about the rain|and ruin my career.
{21189}{21234}- I just feel awful.|- Yeah, you should.
{21239}{21362}Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? She's|never even won a major tournament.
{21393}{21459}Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but...
{21494}{21574}You know, you and Monica have|the same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.
{21579}{21655}I can usually make it go away|by kissing her.
{21670}{21723}Get out.
{21746}{21818}You know, this happens all the time|to my computer at work.
{21824}{21863}- What do you do?|- I usually go...
{21867}{21923}...play Tetris on somebody else's|computer.
{21948}{21991}I can't believe this is happening.
{21995}{22055}I have to give the keynote speech|tomorrow.
{22060}{22147}I have to stand up in front of all|these people. What am I gonna say?
{22153}{22204}You can use a speech I memorized|for auditions.
{22210}{22296}I don't think your monologue from|"Star Wars" is gonna help me right now.
{22315}{22376}Ross, we can solve this.|I just heard your speech.
{22381}{22491}- We can re-create it. We've got all night.|- What, you really think we can do that?
{22496}{22578}Oh, wait.|Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.
{22583}{22640}Don't worry about that.|I mean, Ross needs you.
{22645}{22735}Rachel and I will stay and help|any way we can.
{22759}{22823}All right. Okay, let's do it.
{22833}{22938}Well, I know we start by discussing|the shortcomings of carbon dating.
{22943}{23027}And then I move on to what is clearly|the defining moment...
{23032}{23141}...of the Mesozoic Era,|the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?
{23146}{23245}And then there's the overview|of the Triassic.
{23250}{23347}Any chance any of this happened|in a galaxy far, far away?
{23552}{23593}- Hello?|"- Okay", "Mike?"
{23598}{23659}Enough is enough.|You love Phoebe, and she loves you.
{23664}{23726}So get over your|l-never-wanna-get-married thing...
{23731}{23764}...and step up!
{23778}{23815}Who is this?
{23830}{23873}"This is Monica", "Phoebe's friend."
{23878}{23917}Phoebe is back with David.
{23922}{23973}He's gonna propose,|and she's gonna say yes...
{23978}{24032}...but I know she really wants to be|with you.
{24069}{24144}He's gonna propose?
{24160}{24279}I'm sorry, did you say something?|I can't hear through all this damned hair!
{24305}{24360}If Phoebe wants to marry David,|she should.
{24365}{24435}I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.|Neither should you.
{24440}{24504}You don't tell me what to do.|I tell you what to do.
{24525}{24608}Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel|in Barbados.
{24613}{24666}And while I've got you,|you've got curly hair.
{24671}{24716}What do you do in the humidity?
{24762}{24795}Damn it!
{24861}{24962}- Well, I hope you're happy.|- I hope you're happy too, honey.
{24983}{25034}Phoebe's going to say yes to David.
{25040}{25141}- That's what happens when you meddle.|- Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.
{25146}{25197}No, it's not.|She's still in love with Mike.
{25203}{25257}- There's no chance that will work?|- No, I called.
{25262}{25343}- It's not gonna happen.|- Meddler! Meddler!
{25351}{25397}If you hadn't meddled to start with...
{25402}{25466}...then I wouldn't have had to go in|and meddle myself.
{25470}{25543}No matter how much we meddle,|we'll never be able to unmeddle...
{25548}{25616}...the thing that you meddled up|in the first place!
{25632}{25684}This vacation sucks!
{25822}{25881}I'm so bored.
{25904}{25976}Stupid rain. We can't do anything.
{25982}{26044}Well, I brought some books.|We could read.
{26050}{26096}Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
{26125}{26170}Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.
{26175}{26250}I'm sorry, sir, these are|for the pharmaceutical convention.
{26319}{26377}You feel like going to a convention?
{26393}{26463}- We can't. We're not pharmacists.|- I know we're not...
{26467}{26609}...but Frank Madaio and Eva...
{26694}{26758}- Kate Miller.|- Kate Miller it is.
{26763}{26829}- Okay.|- Oh, good...
{26833}{26920}And that's the most sex|I'm gonna have this weekend.
{26925}{27022}Well, in that case,|should I make sure it's on real good?
{27155}{27202}Thank you.
{27256}{27344}Oh, and then you said that thing about|bringing the Mesozoic Era...
{27349}{27399}...into the 21 st century.
{27404}{27443}Well, yeah. That's it?
{27449}{27507}- Yeah.|- Oh, my God. We did it.
{27512}{27627}Actually, I did it, Ross. You remembered|shockingly little of your own speech.
{27640}{27733}Yes, but I did make a pyramid|out of the bath products.
{27763}{27864}Oh, this is amazing.|Thank you. Thank you so much.
{27940}{27987}That's a pretty necklace.
{28049}{28082}Thank you.
{28109}{28165}Hey, what do you say we celebrate?|Champagne?
{28170}{28269}Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,|we can fill the bottle with water...
{28273}{28329}...and put it back so they|don't charge you.
{28394}{28452}Oh, my God, I love you.
{28466}{28553}This is such a cute picture of Emma.|And is this your son...
{28558}{28624}...or just some kid whose picture|you bring on vacation?
{28630}{28689}That's Ben, my son|from my first marriage.
{28695}{28730}- Your first marriage?|- Yeah.
{28735}{28793}You've been married more than once?
{28799}{28836}No.
{28914}{28955}So why'd you break up?
{29002}{29060}Oh, it was...
{29084}{29192}It's complicated, you know?|She was...
{29201}{29262}...gay.|- Oh, my God.
{29267}{29307}This is so cool!
{29321}{29383}Okay.|Odd thing to get excited about.
{29388}{29470}No, it's just that I was engaged|to a guy who turned out to be gay.
{29476}{29521}Hey! High-five!
{29560}{29630}Didn't you feel so stupid|that you didn't see the signs?
{29636}{29715}My fiance was always going on|long weekends with his "tennis partner."
{29721}{29828}My wife had a workout friend she went|to the gym with every day for a year.
{29833}{29892}She didn't get any fitter.
{29898}{29967}- Everybody's like, "I knew all along."|- I know.
{29973}{30058}If you knew, why didn't you tell me?|I mean, call, leave a note.
{30063}{30135}"Hi. Just dropped by|to say your wife's gay."
{30142}{30175}- I know.|- And then...
{30180}{30246}And then you try to make the best|of a bad situation...
{30251}{30321}...so you float the idea of a threesome.
{30333}{30382}I didn't do that.
{30409}{30471}Me neither.
{30534}{30600}Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.
{30604}{30678}I know. That old lady at the end|was ready to take you home.
{30683}{30757}Not enough pills in the world, Rach.
{30811}{30904}What about you, huh? You're the single|one. See anybody in there you like?
{30910}{31000}Well, let's see. There was that|really big guy that I was talking to...
{31005}{31073}...with the really nice breasts.
{31090}{31215}But what about back home? Anything|going on there? Anybody you like?
{31305}{31331}No.
{31370}{31455}- There is. You're blushing.|- No, I'm not blushing...
{31460}{31504}...and I'm sunburned.
{31512}{31573}From, you know, the rain.
{31579}{31622}You like someone. Tell me who.
{31627}{31681}- Tell me who it is. Come on.|- No. Joey.
{31686}{31750}Who do you like?|You're not getting away that easy.
{31754}{31797}- Who do you like?|- Joey, come on!
{31801}{31910}It doesn't matter, you know?|It's not like anything's gonna happen.
{31915}{32019}What? Why not?|Rach, who can you not get?
{32146}{32249}Okay. Okay.|You really want to know who it is?
{32254}{32320}- Yeah. Who is it?|- Do you?
{32367}{32415}- Oh, hey.|- I just left you a message.
{32421}{32469}Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...
{32474}{32536}...but now that you're here,|we could have that dinner.
{32542}{32630}Right! Of course.|Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
{32636}{32693}Yep! We got it. We got it.|Thank you so much.
{32698}{32743}- I had a great time.|- Yeah.
{32749}{32805}This isn't over,|because I really want to know...
{32811}{32844}Later. Later.
{32867}{32918}- So shall we?|- Yeah.
{32927}{32968}- Okay.|- Good night.
{32975}{33022}Good night.
{33179}{33255}- Okay, good night.|- Good night, Ross.
{33364}{33418}I can't believe she's gonna|say yes to David.
{33423}{33473}She's clearly in love with Mike.
{33479}{33570}You know, it's very hard to take you|seriously when you look like that.
{33670}{33802}Phoebe, I have something I want to say.
{33807}{33873}Oh, God, he's gonna do it.|I cannot watch this. Let's go.
{33878}{33936}I think we have time.|Have you heard him talk?
{33941}{34063}"Phoebe, I would be honored if..."|Spit it out, David!
{34114}{34144}Phoebe.
{34225}{34376}You're an amazing woman, and the time|we spent apart was unbearable.
{34381}{34463}Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk|didn't help.
{34469}{34500}Sure. Okay. Yeah.
{34505}{34651}But, well, now that we're together|again, I don't ever want to be apart.
{34656}{34753}So to that end...
{34801}{34910}- Oh, my God, Mike.|- It's David, actually.
{34916}{34960}No, Mike's here.
{34988}{35027}Oh, hey, Mike.
{35058}{35111}Hi, David.
{35123}{35197}Chandler. Monic... Oh!
{35267}{35333}It's the humidity!
{35397}{35486}- Hi, Phoebe.|- What are you doing here?
{35505}{35551}I have a question I need to ask you.
{35557}{35645}I have a question I was kind of|gonna ask her myself.
{35651}{35754}Yeah, I understand, but before you do,|she really needs to hear this.
{35800}{35843}Okay.
{35847}{35944}- Would you care for my seat as well?|- Actually, yeah, that'd be great.
{35978}{36027}Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.
{36306}{36349}Phoebe, I love you.
{36354}{36420}I've missed you so much|these last few months.
{36425}{36479}I thought we were apart|for a good reason...
{36484}{36543}...but I realized that there was no reason|good enough...
{36548}{36632}...to keep me from spending|the rest of my life with you.
{36642}{36723}Kind of steps on the toes|of what I was going to say.
{36765}{36826}I'm sorry, David,|but she really has to know this.
{36832}{36910}All right, but after this,|I want to see you outside.
{36915}{36954}If the rain stops.
{37029}{37116}You're the most incredible woman|I've ever met.
{37134}{37251}How could I lose you?|Now, I don't actually have a ring.
{37257}{37336}- I have a ring.|- I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.
{37374}{37420}But, Phoebe...
{37441}{37500}...will you marry me?
{37581}{37618}No.
{37808}{37917}I love you, but I never needed|a proposal from you.
{37923}{37981}I just needed to know|we were headed somewhere.
{37987}{38106}- That we had a future.|- We can have any future you want.
{38261}{38333}Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.
{38343}{38403}David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
{38408}{38505}Just so I know, if I had asked first...?
{38510}{38642}Yeah, I might have said yes,|but that would've been wrong.
{38668}{38715}Please, you don't have to explain.
{38720}{38789}I mean, perhaps if I hadn't|gone to Minsk...
{38794}{38912}...things would have worked out for us,|and I wouldn't have ruined my career.
{38917}{38994}Or lost that toe to frostbite.
{39008}{39045}It was a good trip.
{39138}{39197}- Is it okay if I hug you now?|- Oh, yes.
{39282}{39356}Because of our meddling! All right?
{39564}{39665}Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.|I could just lie here all day.
{39670}{39723}Oh, I know.
{39758}{39876}- Open your drapes! Open your drapes!|- So glad we got adjoining rooms.
{39902}{40011}- The sun is out!|- Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
{40017}{40058}Go to the pool and reserve chairs.
{40064}{40167}- I will get the magazines and the lotion.|- Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.
{40172}{40217}- No!|- Damn it!
{40242}{40306}Walls are pretty thin, guys.
{40442}{40563}"Then we have to weigh the data from|recent MRI scans and DNA testing...
{40584}{40709}...which call into question information|gathered from years of carbon dating."
{40715}{40804}Look at the woman sitting out|by the pool getting tan.
{40809}{40897}She's all leathery and wrinkled.|I'm so jealous!
{40909}{41006}"Finally, factor in the profusion|of new species recently discovered.
{41011}{41063}{y:i}Giganotosaurus.
{41080}{41169}"- Argentinosaurus."|- Not to mention "Coldsaurus."
{41241}{41334}"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not|even gonna discuss the carnivores.
{41339}{41378}Their heads are already too big.
{41383}{41477}Which is ironic, considering|their stunted cerebral development."
{41586}{41617}Really?
{41673}{41743}"But all kidding aside,|in much the same way...
{41748}{41865}...that "Homo ergaster" is thought to be a|separate species from "Homo erectus"..."
{41951}{42030}- What?|- He said "erectus."
{42035}{42141}- You're kidding, right?|- No, he really said it.
{42167}{42229}"And while there are certainly|vast differences...
{42234}{42349}...between these Mesozoic fossils|and the example of "Homo erectus"..."
{42412}{42445}"Erectus"?
{42449}{42504}{y:i}- Homo.|- Right.
{42544}{42683}"In a very real way, we can bring|the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century."
{42688}{42744}Thank you.
{42881}{42926}- Really great.|- Oh, thanks, guys.
{42931}{43057}I thought it was wonderful.|Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.
{43062}{43200}I mean, the ideas you put forth,|and from someone so young and...
{43337}{43409}Okay, now we're just holding hands.
{43416}{43508}Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.|That was really great.
{43513}{43577}- Oh, thank you.|- Yeah. Oh, and so funny.
{43613}{43681}- Take it easy.|- All right, thanks. Thanks so much.
{43686}{43748}I can't tell you how much it means|that you were here.
{43753}{43798}You kidding?|We wouldn't have missed it.
{43884}{43927}I'm back.
{43943}{44020}Okay. Well, excuse me?
{44070}{44115}- Well?|- You were incredible.
{44120}{44153}You blew them away.
{44159}{44251}I can't tell you how great it was|to look in the crowd and see your face.
{44256}{44342}I mean, did you know you were|mouthing the words along with me?
{44348}{44385}- I was not.|- No, it's okay.
{44391}{44461}It made me feel like a rock star.
{44470}{44542}Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.
{44552}{44621}Hey, I better not find you naked|in my hotel room.
{44723}{44773}Look, I took it too far.
{44921}{44993}I can't believe it's raining again.|It's so unfair.
{44998}{45064}Well, on the bright side,|now we won't have to see...
{45069}{45151}...all these paleontologists|with their shirts off.
{45198}{45254}Not you guys.
{45262}{45326}You've got it going on.
{45403}{45471}- What will we do today?|- They have a game room downstairs.
{45476}{45513}They have Ping-Pong and stuff.
{45518}{45562}Ping-Pong?|Honey, they have Ping-Pong.
{45567}{45623}- Let's play.|- I don't think so.
{45652}{45707}- Why not?|- You know how competitive you get.
{45712}{45786}And while I say it's cute,|others disagree, and I'm lying.
{45829}{45890}- I'm not always that bad.|- Oh, yeah?
{45895}{45952}What happened when we played|last time?
{45957}{46018}I punched you.
{46024}{46090}- And?|- Phoebe.
{46111}{46192}- And?|- I clunked your heads together.
{46653}{46696}- There you are.|- Hey. Listen.
{46701}{46787}As soon as it stops raining,|we have got to go snorkeling.
{46793}{46881}Some kid told me about this sea turtle.|If you blow bubbles in his face...
{46886}{46942}...he chases you.
{46948}{47055}I'm sorry, I can't. I'm running|a discussion group all afternoon.
{47059}{47121}That's okay.|I'll find someone else to do it.
{47127}{47169}I'd do it alone, but...
{47174}{47257}...I don't know what happens|if the sea turtle catches you.
{47277}{47326}You know, I feel so bad.
{47331}{47399}I haven't seen you this whole trip.|Especially last night...
{47404}{47486}Don't worry about it. It was fine.|I had the best time with Rachel.
{47491}{47585}I just felt bad for you, stuck|in that room working on Ross' speech.
{47591}{47665}Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.
{47684}{47777}Oh, well, at least|we're both having fun, right?
{47811}{47881}- Is it weird that it's not with each other?|- Yeah.
{47885}{47925}A little bit, yeah.
{48040}{48096}I think we need to talk.
{48123}{48191}Yeah, I think we do.
{48255}{48293}About what?
{48366}{48434}- Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!|- All right.
{48439}{48528}- I'll play if we don't keep score.|- Well, then how do we know who wins?
{48559}{48668}- Nobody wins.|- So we're just four losers. Super.
{48694}{48754}- Well, I'm not playing with her.|- I'm out.
{48759}{48802}- I'll play you.|- Okay.
{48807}{48867}- You don't know what you're doing.|- She gets crazy.
{48872}{48934}This scar? That's from Pictionary.
{48986}{49023}I think I'll be all right.
{49028}{49119}- You want to volley a bit for serve?|- Sure, if you want to.
{49267}{49348}Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.
{49410}{49463}Oh, dear God, there's two of them.
{49485}{49530}- You ready to play?|- Hell, yeah.
{49536}{49673}- Did you know this about him?|- No idea. I thought he was soft like you.
{49683}{49747}- Want to make it more interesting?|- How much you thinking?
{49752}{49795}- Ten bucks a game?|- Make it 50.
{49800}{49837}- I'll make it 100.|- One thousand...
{49843}{49888}Okay!
{49906}{49965}We'll flip to see who goes first.|You got a quarter?
{49973}{50041}No. Either of you girls got a quarter?
{50072}{50132}Honey, try to focus the trash talk|on him.
{50166}{50243}- Monica, you call it.|- Heads. No, tails! Heads!
{50249}{50306}- Tails.|- Oh, what are the chances?
{50429}{50471}- My point!|- Oh, no, I don't think so.
{50477}{50565}Standard rules: If at any time a player|uses his nonracket-bearing hand...
{50570}{50642}...to touch the playing surface,|he or she forfeits the point.
{50727}{50774}He was a lawyer.
{50822}{50874}{y:i}All the East Coast|{y:i}is having beautiful weather.
{50880}{50927}"In New York", "it's 72 and sunny."
{50945}{50991}Weather bitch.
{51044}{51083}It's open.
{51115}{51150}- Hi, Joe.|- Hey.
{51166}{51259}- What? Is everything okay?|- Charlie and I broke up.
{51265}{51314}No. Why?
{51320}{51386}Well, she said|we have nothing in common.
{51391}{51436}That's crazy.
{51451}{51503}No, it's not.|We have nothing in common.
{51530}{51583}- Yeah, that's true.|- Yeah.
{51589}{51661}I mean, she should be with someone|more like Ross.
{51665}{51743}You know, I mean he uses|all those big words too.
{51748}{51842}- Man, smart people are dull.|- Well, hey!
{51848}{51901}Okay, Rach.
{51929}{52070}I feel so stupid, you know? Why do I|keep going after the wrong girls?
{52076}{52138}- What are you talking about?|- Oh, come on.
{52143}{52273}I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.|It's like... What the hell's my problem?
{52277}{52327}I just...
{52420}{52561}Okay. Maybe you're not|always going after the wrong girl.
{52567}{52639}I'm telling you, Rach,|Charlie is not right for me.
{52645}{52717}- I'm not talking about her.|- Well, then, who?
{52721}{52787}The waitress I went out with last month?
{52818}{52867}- You know what? Forget it.|- No, no, no, no.
{52872}{52928}- Who are you talking about?|- No, I don't...
{52933}{53001}I actually don't know who|I'm talking about, so...
{53012}{53061}- Okay.|- Yeah.
{53066}{53134}Well, I'm gonna go see|if I can get a room for tonight.
{53140}{53228}- And I'll see you later.|- Yeah, sure. Okay.
{53849}{53908}- You like me?|- Okay.
{53914}{53987}- Let's not make a big thing about this.|- It's a huge thing!
{53993}{54044}Okay, not working with me, Joe.
{54054}{54179}Look, here's the thing.|Lately, I have been having thoughts.
{54189}{54239}Musings, if you will.
{54272}{54330}- Well, for how long?|- Oh, only like a month.
{54336}{54375}- A month?|- Well...
{54381}{54513}Dial it down. Listen, maybe they're|crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.
{54518}{54599}I have been thinking about,|you know, us.
{54642}{54721}- Okay, dial it up a little.|- Oh, you're right. Okay.
{54726}{54763}- I just have a question.|- Shoot.
{54768}{54849}- What the hell are you doing?|- I'm not trying to do anything.
{54854}{54933}It's just, we have such a good time|when we're together, you know?
{54938}{55039}And I mean, aren't you just|a little curious what it would be like?
{55045}{55138}Am I curious?|I mean, I'm as curious as...
{55149}{55201}...George!
{55242}{55297}- Who?|- Curious George!
{55302}{55368}You know, the monkey and the guy|with the yellow hat.
{55373}{55430}- Of course. I remember.|- He had a paper route.
{55435}{55478}Yeah, he did.
{55484}{55566}- See, this is what I'm talking about.|- No, I know. We're great!
{55571}{55637}But, Rach, no, this can't happen.
{55642}{55735}Can't it just happen a little bit?
{55791}{55868}- No! It can't happen at all!|- Why not?
{55873}{55961}Because, look, no one wants|this to happen more than me, okay?
{55966}{56047}I have gone over this moment|in my head 100 times...
{56052}{56132}...and not once did I ever say no.
{56221}{56293}I couldn't do it to Ross.
{56311}{56381}- But that wasn't gonna stop you before.|- I know. I know...
{56385}{56517}...but I've thought about it a lot|since then, and it just wouldn't be right.
{56586}{56619}I'm sorry.
{56681}{56739}I'm sorry too.
{56771}{56829}- Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.|- No, no.
{56834}{56882}No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.
{56887}{56951}- Like you said, it's no big deal.|- It's not a big deal.
{56957}{57003}- No big deal.|- It's so not a big deal.
{57009}{57089}- I'll see you later. All right, hey.|- Okay, great.
{57558}{57606}Okay...
{57909}{58014}Oh, I'm sorry, I think...|I think that may have missed the table.
{58021}{58060}- Oh, do you?|- Yeah.
{58066}{58092}- Do you?|- Yeah.
{58098}{58141}- Do you?|- Yeah!
{58161}{58239}- You really find this attractive on him?|- Oh, yeah.
{58245}{58338}Are you telling me you're not even|a little turned on by Monica right now?
{58490}{58587}This is the first time in our marriage that|I've felt like the more attractive one.
{58606}{58662}All right, come on, Mike.|You can beat her.
{58668}{58726}Knock that dog off her head.
{58801}{58871}- Damn it!|- I sleep with him!
{58919}{58975}- Game point.|- Don't get too cocky.
{58980}{59017}Remember, I won the last one.
{59021}{59095}Oh, by the way,|how did that feel, losing to a girl?
{59101}{59171}You should look in the mirror|before you call yourself that.
{59277}{59359}- No! No! No!|- And that's how it's done.
{59375}{59405}Okey-dokey.
{59411}{59506}You've each won a game, and I've lost|what's felt like a year of my life.
{59511}{59555}Everybody goes home a winner.
{59561}{59602}- Best of three?|- That's what I'm thinking.
{59608}{59726}Should I use my invisibility|to fight crime or for evil?
{59755}{59812}- Serve the ball, chump.|- "Serve the ball, chump."
{59818}{59905}Okay, better comebacks, Mike.|Better comebacks.
{59964}{60028}I'm just saying,|I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.
{60034}{60128}If you ever want to get away|from the city, well, that'd be...
{60145}{60197}...just nifty.
{60247}{60364}Well, I've kind of got a lot on my plate|right now.
{60369}{60474}Not that I wouldn't love a weekend|in the country with a strange man.
{60520}{60588}- Jarvis?|- Oh, you're back.
{60617}{60714}- This is my wife, Nancy.|- Well, get out!
{60753}{60828}- Ross? Can I talk to you for a minute?|- Yes, please.
{60897}{60965}So, what's going on?
{61011}{61103}Well, Joey and I broke up.
{61115}{61245}- Oh, my God. What happened?|- Joey is a great guy...
{61249}{61310}...but we're just...|We're so different.
{61315}{61394}I mean, like, during your speech,|he kept laughing at "Homo erectus."
{61400}{61458}I knew that was him!
{61497}{61591}Anyway, I just...|I think it's for the best.
{61610}{61718}- Hey. Hey, you okay?|- I guess.
{61772}{61822}There was...
{61847}{61970}There was another reason that I thought|it was time to end it with Joey.
{61983}{62129}I started to realize that I was|having feelings for someone else.
{62163}{62229}Okay, Geller.|Last day of the conference.
{62235}{62289}You know what happens|to the keynote speaker.
{62295}{62367}Professor Klarik, we're in the middle|of a conversation here.
{62371}{62476}- Can't you throw him in the pool later?|- Or we could throw you both in now.
{62482}{62563}Okay, gentlemen, please.|Aren't we a little old for this?
{62568}{62632}I mean, we're scientists, all right?|We're academics...
{62636}{62735}...and most importantly,|you will have to catch us first.
{62739}{62790}Go! Go! Go!
{63014}{63071}Okay, so it's tied again,|41 to 41.
{63113}{63189}- Okay, look, enough is enough.|- No.
{63195}{63290}- I just have two more points to beat him.|- Monica, that was also true an hour ago!
{63295}{63332}I mean, please, look at you.
{63338}{63445}Your hand is blistered, you can|barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!
{63491}{63551}You've already proven|you're just as good as he is.
{63556}{63627}We missed our dinner reservations,|so let's just go upstairs...
{63632}{63704}...order room service, take a shower|and shave your head!
{63749}{63821}I can't just walk away.|I've put in four hours.
{63836}{63885}You knew this about me|when you married me.
{63890}{63960}You agreed to take me in sickness|and in health.
{63965}{64025}Well, this is my sickness!
{64031}{64118}- What about the obsessive cleaning?|- That's just good sense.
{64308}{64352}- You okay?|- No, honey, I'm okay.
{64358}{64451}Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.|No shaking. No shaking.
{64537}{64621}Oh, my God. I can't play.
{64627}{64684}- So you forfeit?|- Mike wins?
{64708}{64790}I can't believe it. I lost.
{64864}{64951}- No, you didn't.|- What?
{64957}{65031}- Because I'm gonna play for you.|- You can't do that.
{65037}{65115}It's okay.|I don't care which of them I beat.
{65134}{65226}Okay, we're taking that paddle home,|mister.
{65311}{65369}- Honey, you don't have to do this.|- Yes, I do.
{65375}{65429}I may not understand why|you have to win so badly...
{65434}{65495}...but if it's important to you,|it's important to me.
{65500}{65539}Because I love you.
{65562}{65646}But you suck.
{65676}{65721}You're welcome, sweetheart.
{65745}{65802}All right, let's get this over with.|Sudden death.
{65807}{65900}- Whoever wins this point, wins.|- Okay.
{65988}{66108}- Oh, my God. You're good.|- It's like watching porn.
{66246}{66310}And that's how it's done.
{66357}{66439}Oh, my God. Oh, my God.|That was so amazing.
{66444}{66487}Well, when did you...?
{66492}{66591}Hold on, I almost forgot. Loser.
{66659}{66738}- When did you stop sucking?|- I never sucked. I just didn't want you...
{66743}{66791}...to know how good I was.|- Why?
{66796}{66843}- I don't know.|- Well, this is so great.
{66848}{66912}- Now we can enter doubles tournaments.|- That's why.
{67146}{67189}- They still looking for us?|- Yeah.
{67193}{67261}The bartender said they split up|into two search parties.
{67265}{67323}The herbivores and the carnivores.
{67356}{67438}You know, we, as a group,|are not the coolest.
{67443}{67487}Oh, look out.
{67646}{67726}- I don't think they saw us.|- I don't think they did.
{67891}{67988}So I started to tell you something earlier.
{68031}{68163}There was another reason that I realized|it was time to end it with Joey.
{68168}{68291}I kind of realized I was starting|to have feelings...
{68296}{68348}...for someone else.
{68426}{68486}And can I ask who?
{68514}{68563}I think you know.
{68589}{68723}I think I know too, but I've been really|wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
{69158}{69271}- I'm sorry, we can't.|- All right. All right.
{69277}{69363}I mean, you just went out|with my best friend, you know?
{69369}{69458}I just think it would be a really,|really bad idea.
{69546}{69617}Or not. I mean...
{70517}{70542}What?

1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,891
The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong
was such a turn-on. You wanna...?

2
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,056
You know, I'd love to,
but I'm a little tired.

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,174
- I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
- You're on.

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,898
- Hey.
- What's up?

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,979
Well, Mike's taking a shower, which,
by the way, there's no law against.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,132
And then we're gonna grab some food.
So if you want...

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,256
- Finally.
- Is that Ross?

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,611
Yeah. You can hear everything
through these stupid walls.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,409
- Sounds like he's with someone.
- He could be alone.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,936
This morning I heard him do pushups
and then talk to his triceps.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,489
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,454
Yeah, I hear someone else
in there with him.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,735
- Dr. Geller!
- God, you're amazing.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,892
I didn't even have to ask you
to call me that.

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,815
- Oh, my God, that's Charlie!
- She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:07,178
Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!

17
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,775
- I'm not sure about this.
- Yeah, you're right.

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,259
This is none of our business.

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,571
I'm not sure it's the best way
to hear everything. Get me a glass!

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,452
No, I'm not gonna do this, okay?
I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

21
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,009
I love Barbados.

22
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,858
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I'm kissing Rachel!

23
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,811
I know. I'm her.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,649
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,578
- What?
- Get over here!

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,058
Oh, my God! I love how thin
these walls are!

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,857
Thank you.

28
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,411
The One After Joey and Rachel Kiss

29
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,658
Hey, before, you said that nothing could
happen between us. What changed?

30
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,414
Well, I only said that because of Ross.

31
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,339
- And then I saw him kissing Charlie.
- What?

32
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,411
Ross and Charlie?

33
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,619
Wow! She's really making her way
through the group, huh?

34
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,897
- Eh, who am I to talk?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,570
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

36
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,698
How about the dinosaur twins
in the other room?

37
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,451
- No one is manning that wall!
- I'm on it!

38
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,976
- Anything?
- I think I hear curtains closing.

39
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,092
We've got shoes being kicked off
over here.

40
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,417
Bedsprings! Unmistakable!

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,056
- You realize that's your brother.
- Not until you said it. Somebody switch!

42
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,371
Wow! Wait a minute.

43
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,208
Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel.

44
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,850
Phoebe and Mike. We're the only ones
leaving with the person we came with!

45
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,769
That's not true. I came with Monica,
I'm leaving with Weird Al.

46
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,850
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.

47
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,898
- Tomorrow I'm going to the salon.
- Okay, Buckwheat.

48
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,931
You gotta hear this, it's great!
It's like free porn.

49
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,808
- Is everything okay?
- It's just... I don't think I can do this.

50
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,255
Oh, is it because of what might
be on the bed?

51
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,651
- I saw that report, with the infrared...
- No! No.

52
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,651
No.

53
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,294
Look, I need to talk to Joey.
I mean, you guys just broke up.

54
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,169
Before anything more happens between
us, I need to know he's okay with it.

55
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,376
- I completely understand.
- All right, I'm gonna go find him.

56
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,899
I just need a second before I can,
you know...

57
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,695
Grandma, Grandma, Grandma.

58
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,169
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay!

59
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,571
That's the door. He's gone.

60
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,618
And she's turning on the TV...

61
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,376
...and watching <i>Miss Congeniality</i>.

62
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,859
Honey? If you know it through a wall,
you know it too well.

63
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,695
Hey, what are you guys doing?

64
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,539
We're just... We're sad to go, so we're
just saying goodbye to the hotel.

65
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,338
I love you...

66
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:38,732
...Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa.

67
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,893
Yeah. We had a great time, thank you.

68
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,772
Bye.

69
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,372
Okay. Hey, have you guys
seen Joey anywhere?

70
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,458
He's probably in his room
with his current girlfriend, Charlie.

71
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,134
That's the situation as we know it.

72
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,254
If you see him, could you tell him
I'm looking for him?

73
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,570
- You got it.
- Thanks.

74
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,054
Thank you.

75
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,853
Other wall, people! Other wall!

76
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,100
- Rach, you there?
- Oh, my God, that's Ross!

77
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,296
- What are we gonna do?
- Okay, just be calm.

78
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,530
For all he knows,
we're just hanging out.

79
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,214
All right? So just be nonchalant.

80
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,500
- That's not nonchalant!
- No idea what it means.

81
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,457
Okay, just hide.

82
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,215
- Rach?
- Coming! Try under the bed.

83
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,413
There's no room under the bed...

84
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,933
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

85
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,659
- Hey. Do you know where Joey is?
- Hi.

86
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,097
I really don't.

87
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,092
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

88
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,739
I don't believe this.
Have you guys been...?

89
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,579
This is the listening side of the wall.

90
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,849
Then she told me
that she and Joey had broken up...

91
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,454
...and part of the reason
was she had feelings for me.

92
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,935
Right. Yeah.

93
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,052
You know I've wanted to ask Charlie
out since the day I met her.

94
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,616
Oh, I know, I know.
That's been really hard for you.

95
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,692
Anyway, one thing led to another, and...

96
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,976
...before you know it, we were kissing.

97
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,370
How angry do you think
Joey's gonna be?

98
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,210
That is hard to say, Ross.
That is hard to say.

99
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,370
I gotta find him.
He's gotta be here someplace.

100
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,013
You would think.

101
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,292
Joey?

102
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,816
- Is he gone?
- How are you doing this?

103
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,898
What? Hey!

104
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,291
What are you...? What is this?
Have you been listening this entire time?

105
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,252
Yeah!

106
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,379
Now, what is this?

107
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,618
What is this? Well, let's see.
We kissed for 10 minutes...

108
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,012
...and now we're talking to our friends
about it, so I guess this is sixth grade.

109
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,490
No, no. Have you thought
about how complicated this could get?

110
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,810
- What about Ross?
- Well, he's with Charlie now.

111
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,410
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
before anything really happens with her.

112
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,255
And as his friend, I mean, don't you
think he deserves the same from you?

113
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,011
You're a pain in my ass, Geller.

114
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,531
Look, we appreciate all the advice...

115
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,055
...but this is between Joey and me.
We can handle it.

116
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,451
We'll go. Will you do one thing for us,
the people that care about you?

117
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,451
- Sure.
- Enunciate.

118
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,810
Get out!

119
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,491
Are they right?

120
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,334
Probably, yeah. I mean,
maybe we should...

121
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,297
...hold off until we talk to Ross.

122
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,128
Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.

123
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,853
Yeah, I think that would be best.

124
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,615
So, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off.

125
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,975
- Although...
- I like "although."

126
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,697
I mean, you know...

127
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,091
Ross and I haven't dated in, like...

128
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,978
...six years.

129
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,932
Six years?

130
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,611
Wow. That's almost as long
as high school.

131
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,132
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

132
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,773
Absolutely.

133
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,408
- He's not thinking about you.
- No.

134
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,610
I'm thinking about you.

135
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,779
Yeah.

136
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,658
- Let's forget about Ross.
- It's forgotten.

137
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,292
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

138
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,536
Seriously, what is it?

139
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,257
Nothing. It's really... It's nothing.
Come here. Come here.

140
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,254
What's wrong?

141
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,729
Sorry, I just...

142
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,778
I can't seem to get Ross
out of my head.

143
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,050
Well, maybe I can help.

144
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,697
Your lips are so soft. Do that again.

145
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,295
Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah.

146
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,212
Hey. You guys ready to go?

147
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,139
Not quite. Monica's at the salon,
and I'm finishing packing.

148
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,537
Dude, you're not taking your Bible?

149
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,133
You're not supposed to take that.

150
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,098
Besides, it's a New Testament.
What are you gonna do with it?

151
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,091
Learn about Jesus.

152
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,016
- Hey!
- So did you talk to Joey?

153
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,378
No. I couldn't find him. I'm just
gonna talk to him on the plane.

154
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,175
Okay. Sounds like a good idea,
Dr. Geller.

155
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,693
Stop it.

156
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,298
Ph.D.

157
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,616
You're filthy.

158
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,810
- Hey. Have you guys seen Monica?
- Actually, I think she went to the salon.

159
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,215
Oh, yeah. Oh, she went
to the salon, all right.

160
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,814
Check it out!

161
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,371
Whose day just got better?

162
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,016
Chandler!

163
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,495
Hey!

164
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,051
- What do you think?
- I think...

165
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,814
I think I can see your scalp.

166
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,178
Don't you just love it?

167
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,138
Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish
in your head.

168
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,616
It's something. You go, girlfriend.

169
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,216
- You never said that in your life.
- Not once.

170
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,656
- I thought so.
- Oh, and listen to this.

171
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,453
What do you know? It's a treat
for the eyes and the ears.

172
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,771
Wow, it's kind of weird that I'm
sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

173
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,609
Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados
doesn't care about your social life.

174
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,809
Does someone mind switching
and sitting with Charlie?

175
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,814
Oh, I mean, l... Dude, I spent
the whole conference with Charlie.

176
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,413
- I understand.
- No, I'll do it.

177
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,455
Wish I could switch. I really don't want
to sit with Allen Iverson over there.

178
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,337
Once we're in the air and the
captain turns off the seat belt sign...

179
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,458
...you feel free to roam about my cabin.

180
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,779
And you should be careful
when checking your overhead bins.

181
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,171
- Because items may shift during...
- Oh, you're not good at this.

182
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,812
- Do you have to go home tonight?
- No, I think I could come over.

183
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,299
It's Saturday, right?

184
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,694
What?

185
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,409
- I can't do anything tonight.
- Why not?

186
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,577
I have a date.

187
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,300
- You have a date? With who?
- Oh, it's my girlfriend.

188
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,094
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

189
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,019
Well, when you and I broke up,
I started seeing someone.

190
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,654
- Well, for how long?
- Three months.

191
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,418
Three months?

192
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,893
Okay.

193
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,736
This is none of my business, but how
long are you gonna keep seeing her?

194
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,973
I'll tell her that it's over
tonight at dinner. I promise.

195
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,614
Oh, okay, good. You do that.

196
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,811
When you get home, maybe there'll be a
special delivery package waiting for you.

197
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,771
Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.

198
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,579
- Pull out the packing material...
- We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.

199
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,330
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.

200
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,612
He's in a good mood after
the flight attendant says "duty-free."

201
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,097
Okay. Good luck.

202
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,897
Ross is coming over. I think now
would be a good time to talk to him.

203
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,129
I guess so. I'm just...
I'm really nervous.

204
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,689
Well, keep in mind
that by the time you're done...

205
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,499
...they'll probably be serving dinner.

206
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,212
Still nervous?

207
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,294
I'm gonna get the lasagna.

208
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,539
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah?

209
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,056
- Do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

210
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,097
<i>Good luck.</i>

211
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,336
- Hey.
- Hey.

212
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,772
So I...

213
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,374
I kind of need to talk to you
about Charlie.

214
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,374
- Yeah?
- Last night, after you guys broke up...

215
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,771
So sorry to hear about that,
by the way.

216
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,330
Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...

217
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,972
Well...

218
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,774
You kissed.

219
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,218
Wh... What?

220
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,258
What? What would give you that idea?

221
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,020
- I saw you.
- Yeah, we kissed.

222
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,179
But nothing else.
Nothing else happened, okay?

223
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,338
- Ross, Ross, Ross. It's okay.
- What?

224
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,934
It's okay. You know, look...

225
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,092
...I totally understand, all right?
You guys...

226
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,856
...make way more sense than her
and I ever did, you know? And...

227
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,092
- I want you to be happy.
- Are you serious?

228
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,739
Yeah.

229
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,411
- Now I have something...
- I am speechless.

230
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,216
I mean, the fact that you would put
my happiness first like that, I mean...

231
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,735
You're an incredible friend,
do you know that?

232
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,500
- Well, look, before you go...
- No, I mean it.

233
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,094
I mean, you're so loyal, man.
And selfless and generous.

234
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,618
I am those things, yeah.

235
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,296
I've known Chandler longer, so I think
of him as my best friend. But now...

236
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,850
...I may have to rethink some stuff.

237
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,495
Dude!

238
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,818
Hey, if there is ever anything
I can do for you...

239
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,698
I can't think of anything.

240
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,291
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

241
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,614
- So hi.
- Hi.

242
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,932
- So you talked to Joey?
- Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.

243
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,931
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

244
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,898
- So everything's okay?
- Oh, no, it's great.

245
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:15,339
- It's great. He's an amazing guy.
- Oh, well, obviously, I think so too.

246
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,493
Well, I'm so excited about this.

247
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,653
Really? Excited?

248
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:28,133
What, are you kidding? I have had
some very dirty dreams about this.

249
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,296
Excuse me.

250
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,170
You didn't tell him, did you?

251
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,457
I couldn't. He was saying all
these really nice things about me.

252
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,772
I didn't want him to get mad and take
them back. I'm gonna edge out Chandler!

253
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,617
Fine. Forget it. When we go back
to New York, I will tell him.

254
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,498
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

255
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,374
- Hi, Mike's place.
- Hey, it's Mike.

256
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,140
- That was fast.
- <i>Oh, no, she's not here yet.</i>

257
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,535
You know, I'm just gonna take off
and break up with her over the phone.

258
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,130
You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike,
strap on a pair.

259
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,656
Why don't you tell her that we got back
together. Women appreciate honesty.

260
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,848
We also appreciate gentle spanking
once in a while, just FYI.

261
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,417
One more thing. There might be a picture
of Precious on my coffee table.

262
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,850
Her name's Precious?

263
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,137
Is she a pure breed,
or did you pick her up at the pound?

264
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,134
<i>- I just want to give you a heads up.</i>
- Okay. And if she gets upset...

265
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,292
...just scratch her tummy
and give her a liver snap.

266
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,892
Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?

267
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,415
- I'm Phoebe.
- Phoebe?

268
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,459
Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
The love of his life? That Phoebe?

269
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,019
Oh, I can't wait for everyone
at work to see these!

270
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,930
- You go back to work tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

271
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,017
So if you want people to see them...

272
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,058
...you're not having them taken out,
say, at the break of dawn?

273
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,136
Well, if I had them taken out,
then I wouldn't be able to do this.

274
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,730
You like that, right?

275
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,612
- What are you singing?
- It's "Bolero" from <i>10.</i>

276
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,573
It's "Ride of the Valkyries"
from <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

277
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,374
Here's the thing. The cornrows were
a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.

278
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,976
Now that we're home, you don't have
that problem. If you think about it...

279
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,937
I hate them.

280
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,613
- What? You said you liked them.
- Did I? Let's refresh.

281
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,817
I believe what I said was
that I could see your scalp.

282
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,812
Well, fine. So you don't like them.
Everybody else does.

283
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,133
Again, let's journey back.

284
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,897
As I recall, Rachel said she had never
noticed the shape of your skull before.

285
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,417
And Joey? Well, Joey didn't realize
there was anything different.

286
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,656
You know what? I don't care.
I like it, and I'm gonna keep it.

287
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,057
You're just jealous
because your hair can't do this.

288
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,415
- Get yourself in the tooth?
- And the eye.

289
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,017
Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
Oh, my God, I missed you.

290
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,132
Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.

291
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,019
Did you have a good time
with Grandma Greene? Huh?

292
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,014
Did she give you a bottle of
antidepressants again to use as a rattle?

293
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,776
That was one time, Ross,
and they were only, like, five milligrams.

294
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,017
Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for
you, okay? I want you to wait right here.

295
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,852
Come here, sweetie.

296
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,058
Ross, actually, there's something
that I really need to talk to you about.

297
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,852
Okay, shoot.

298
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,413
- Okay. All right, here's the deal.
- Oh, no!

299
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,335
- What is it?
- Oh, major shampoo explosion!

300
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,778
- Look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
- Oh, it's all over everything!

301
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,496
Why? Why me?

302
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,291
Because you took 300 bottles
of shampoo?

303
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?

304
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,254
- Well, yeah. Look, it's about me and...
- Oh, not another one!

305
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,251
Oh, my God... Oh, and this is moisturizer!
It's even harder to clean!

306
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,290
Why? Why do bad things happen
to good people?

307
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,532
- Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
- You think?

308
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,132
Okay. Bye.

309
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,417
All right, so Mike's on his way over.

310
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,459
You thought you were meeting here,
he thought at the restaurant, so...

311
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,738
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
The point is, I'm gonna take off.

312
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,613
Wait. I'm not letting you leave until
you tell me what's going on. I mean...

313
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,135
...are you guys getting back together
or something?

314
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,098
All right.

315
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,734
Susie... Can I call you Susie?

316
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,171
My name is Precious.

317
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,056
I can't say that.

318
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,218
Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.

319
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,454
Mike and I are back together.
And unfortunately...

320
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,169
...that effectively ends
your relationship with him.

321
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:19,734
He's very sorry about that, and wishes
you the best luck in all your endeavors.

322
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,210
I just can't believe this. Why?

323
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,371
- Well, I don't...
- Why would he do this?

324
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,179
- What's wrong with me?
- There's nothing wrong with you.

325
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,336
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

326
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,612
Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!

327
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,738
Have some pride, for the love of God!

328
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,938
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

329
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,815
I just can't believe that Mike
didn't give me any warning.

330
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,815
He didn't know. He wasn't planning on
coming to Barbados and proposing to me.

331
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,134
He proposed to you?
This is the worst birthday ever!

332
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,932
Look, Precious...

333
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,729
Mike's not worth this.
You're an attractive, intelligent woman...

334
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,289
...and let's face it,
Mike's kind of a wang.

335
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,338
He proposed to me
while he was still seeing you.

336
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,134
He was gonna break up with you
on your birthday?

337
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,896
I don't like to kiss and tell, but
he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

338
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,217
Oh, my God, you know, maybe
you're right. Maybe I don't need him.

339
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,258
I deserve to be treated with respect.

340
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,298
Screw you, Mike. You're a coward
and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell!

341
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,331
You're welcome.

342
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,139
Honey? You've been in there
for a long time. Is everything okay?

343
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,131
Not really.

344
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,251
I have a problem.

345
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,818
Really? What happened?

346
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,299
Well, I was dancing around
and singing "No Woman, No Cry"...

347
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,256
...and I got stuck.

348
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,096
- You can't move at all?
- Oh, I can move.

349
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,773
If I untangle you, will you please
get rid of the cornrows?

350
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,857
I guess so.

351
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,891
- Some of these look a little frayed.
- Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

352
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,099
- Hey.
- Hi.

353
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,656
- So? Did you tell Ross?
- Well, I tried...

354
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,857
...but then he had
a shampoo-related emergency.

355
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,974
- So I guess now it's your turn again.
- No, no, no, no.

356
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,496
I think it's better if you tell him.
You know, it's easier for a woman.

357
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,618
That way, you know, if he gets mad,
all you have to do is go:

358
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,930
"I didn't mean it.

359
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,252
I'm so sorry."

360
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,617
Yeah, because that's what we do.

361
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,815
All right, all right, okay. How about this?
How about this? Tomorrow...

362
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,616
Tomorrow we'll both go
and we'll tell him together.

363
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,418
Okay, that sounds fair.

364
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,259
- That just means, once again, we can't...
- I know.

365
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:24,129
That's okay. I mean, we can
control ourselves. We're not animals.

366
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,174
- No! Of course, we can wait.
- Yeah.

367
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,055
All right, so I guess
that means good night then.

368
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,893
Yep. Good night.

369
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,211
Good night.

370
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,098
Good night.

371
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,133
- Seriously, good night.
- Stop saying good night.

372
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,815
I'm so sorry.

373
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,896
Look what I found in the drawer.

374
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,818
And you said I'd never wear this.

375
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,136
Now that I untangled you, how about
you do a little something for me?

376
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,969
- Sure. What did you have in mind?
- I think you know.

377
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,089
- Really? I don't... I don't really feel like it.
- This is what I want to do.

378
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,539
Okay.

379
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,931
I just don't get why you like it so much.

380
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,456
She's an FBI agent posing
as a beauty contestant!

1
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,933
Okay, Ross.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,610
I realize that you didn't expect
to walk in and see that, but...

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,170
- Let me explain, okay?
- We weren't doing anything!

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,849
Rach, he just saw us.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,410
But what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,090
- That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
- Dude, chill!

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,216
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,099
...but we didn't plan it.
The only reason that that happened...

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,012
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,815
Yeah, you started it!
I have got to chill.

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,416
Look, we probably should have talked to
you about this before it ever happened.

12
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,890
- But...
- Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,177
Yeah. But it did happen.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,059
So...

15
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,694
Ross?

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,334
Ross?

17
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,333
Can we just close the door?

18
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,376
The One Where Ross Is Fine

19
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,378
Ross, say something.

20
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,939
Anything.

21
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,417
So you two are...?

22
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,899
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,936
And have you had...?

24
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,018
- No. No, no, no.
- No. No.

25
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,415
But if I hadn't walked in here,
would you...?

26
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,451
Probably...
No. No.

27
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,579
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.

28
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,611
You have every right
to go nuts.

29
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,936
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?

30
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,937
No, but you know what I mean.

31
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,689
If you two are happy...

32
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,932
...then I'm happy for you.

33
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,810
I'm fine.

34
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,136
- Really?
- Absolutely.

35
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,575
I'm fine.

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,413
Totally fine.

37
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,890
I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...

38
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,938
...because, really, I'm fine.

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:07,178
I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
to see you guys kissing.

40
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,575
I mean, at first I was like:

41
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,099
But now that I've had time
to absorb it...

42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,893
Loving this.

43
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,938
- Ross...
- It's all working out.

44
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,577
Me and Charlie.
And you two.

45
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,738
- You know what we should do?
- Calm ourselves?

46
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,734
No.

47
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,932
We should all have dinner.

48
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,012
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
I'll cook!

49
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,849
Look, don't you think
that would be a little weird?

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,851
Weird? What? What's weird?

51
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,171
The only thing weird would be
if someone didn't like Mexican food...

52
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,296
...because I'm making fajitas!

53
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,617
I do like fajitas.

54
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,618
God, this adoption stuff
is so overwhelming.

55
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,170
There's inter-country adoption,
dependency adoption.

56
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,094
There's so many ways to go, and this is,
like, the biggest decision of our lives.

57
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,818
There's a hair in my coffee.

58
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,173
Hey, guys.

59
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,377
Have you seen Frank Jr.?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.

60
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,531
It's funny,
every time you say "triplets"...

61
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,055
...I think of three hot,
blond 19-year-olds.

62
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,534
That's sweet.

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,617
Drink your hair.

64
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,813
Hey, what's all this stuff?

65
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,534
They're brochures
from different adoption agencies.

66
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,015
Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.

67
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,932
Get this one.

68
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,372
That's not really how it works.

69
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,219
- Oh, how does it work?
- I don't know!

70
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,253
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,457
...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

72
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,212
Thanks, that would be great.

73
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,530
Hey, honey,
wouldn't that be great?

74
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,899
All right, all right.
Remember what we talked about.

75
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,938
When we're in a public place,
there are certain rules.

76
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,009
That's not what we talked about!

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,576
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi.

78
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,537
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,055
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi. Hey, how you doing?

80
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,969
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
so big. Which one is which again?

81
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,978
Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,138
...pulling the tampons out
of the lady's purse.

83
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,255
And that's Chandler
climbing on Chandler.

84
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,533
That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

85
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,251
"Willing to adopt triplets?" No.

86
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,769
Can I just say, I know we're doing this
for Ross and that's cool.

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,410
But if it was up to me, this is not what
we'd be doing on our first date.

88
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,656
Well, what would we be doing?

89
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,856
I'd take you out
for a romantic night.

90
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,895
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.

91
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,419
Feel me up?

92
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,338
In a carriage.

93
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,819
- Hey, Charlie!
- Hi.

94
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,698
- Hi.
- Hey.

95
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,054
So...

96
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,888
...dreading this?
- Oh, you bet.

97
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,895
So did you bring
a little something for Ross?

98
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,530
Actually, it's some stuff you left
at my apartment.

99
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,330
Well, thanks.

100
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,929
And you can just give me
my stuff whenever you want.

101
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,736
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.

102
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,658
I thought I heard voices.

103
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,533
Hi, Charlie.

104
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,175
Hey, Joey.

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,334
And, oh, you're gonna have
to introduce me to your new girlfriend.

106
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,052
I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.
I know...

107
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,656
Come. Please come in.
Come in.

108
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,970
Okay.
Well, we brought you some wine.

109
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,611
That is so thoughtful.

110
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,890
She's a keeper.

111
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,973
- And what did you bring me, huh?
- Actually, that's...

112
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,091
Underwear, a toothbrush...

113
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,296
...and a Van Halen CD.

114
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,974
I can use all these things!

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,535
Gosh, Ross, you know,
you seem a little...

116
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,015
What? Fine? Because I am.

117
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,410
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't...?
You see?

118
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,616
Who else is fine?

119
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,494
Come on.

120
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,658
Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.

121
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,617
You know what,
that is a very good idea.

122
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,294
I'm gonna go make
a pitcher of margaritas.

123
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,298
Oh, God.

124
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,172
So adorable.

125
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,173
Look at them,
sleeping there like angels.

126
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,935
Yeah, I really cherish
these moments...

127
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,490
...because before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.

128
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,850
Well, they may be a handful...

129
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,931
...but they're so cute.
- Yeah.

130
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,615
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing.

131
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,778
I haven't slept in four years.

132
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,690
That's a long time.

133
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,055
You just don't know
how hard it is, Phoebe.

134
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,978
There's just so many of them.

135
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,732
You know, two I could handle.

136
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,334
Two's great.
You just hold one in each hand.

137
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,731
What do I do when the third one runs
at me with his bike helmet on?

138
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,619
I got no more hands
to protect my area.

139
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,650
There's three of them, Phoebe.
Three.

140
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,849
Yeah, I know, Frank.

141
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,171
I counted them when they
were coming out of my area.

142
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,374
Sometimes, I think that...

143
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,973
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.

144
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,694
What?

145
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,936
No, no, I can't.

146
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,488
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?

147
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,697
Because I didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.

148
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,051
Oh, no, I would never do that.
No. I just...

149
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,528
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.

150
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,458
What?

151
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,775
You can't separate them, that's terrible!
Which one?

152
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,059
Thank you so much for seeing us.

153
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,336
Phoebe has told us great things
about you guys.

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,058
Please, we're happy to help.

155
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,729
We went through the same thing
when we were adopting.

156
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,859
So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

157
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,139
I mean, you have a lovely home.

158
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,491
We appreciate anything
you can tell us.

159
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,970
Well, actually,
I think this might help.

160
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,169
It's pretty much...

161
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,410
...all the information you need.
- Oh, my God.

162
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,299
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.

163
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,179
Then color-coded to correspond
with the forms in the back.

164
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,415
Thank you.

165
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,816
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

166
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,136
I know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.

167
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,258
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

168
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,610
That's great. Can I see the book?

169
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,692
You want me to wash
my hands first, don't you?

170
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,818
Please. It's just so pretty and white.

171
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,975
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.

172
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,658
I would have told him to do it too.

173
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,851
Can I adopt you?

174
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,130
- Hey, you must be Owen.
- Yeah.

175
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,695
I'm Chandler.
Hey, I was in the Scouts too.

176
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,370
- You were?
- In fact, my father was a den mother.

177
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,892
You know how to use a compass?

178
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,534
I have a badge in it.

179
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,856
- You do? That's fantastic.
- You want to see it?

180
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,335
I'd love to, but I gotta get back
to your parents.

181
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,695
They're telling us
about how they adopted you.

182
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,418
What?

183
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,698
What?

184
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,974
I'm adopted?

185
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,136
I got nothing.

186
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,732
Well, that first batch of margaritas
was not so great...

187
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,216
...but this second batch is good.

188
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,057
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.

189
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,490
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?

190
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,855
You know, just the four of us.

191
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,772
Just hanging.

192
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,818
Dude, are you okay?

193
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,811
And when are the fajitas
gonna be ready?

194
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,178
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.

195
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,173
I'm just...
I'm just proud of us.

196
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,650
You know?
There's no weirdness, no tension.

197
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,771
No awareness.

198
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,693
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.

199
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,457
Let's take a trip!

200
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,614
Okay, where do you think we can go?

201
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,896
My fajitas!

202
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,532
Look, Charlie,
I just want you to know...

203
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,773
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.

204
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,130
You know, he normally
doesn't drink like this.

205
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,457
You know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.

206
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,580
I'm sorry, have I made
this evening uncomfortable?

207
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,812
Fajitas! Be careful!
Very hot plate! Very hot!

208
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,931
Ross, you don't
even have oven mitts on.

209
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,013
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.

210
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,333
Okay, well, this is crazy.

211
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,896
We can't seriously be talking about me
taking one of your kids, can we?

212
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,573
Oh, no, of course we're not.

213
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,332
- That's insane.
- I know.

214
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,899
Alice would never go for it.

215
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,172
She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.

216
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,972
Well, just for argument's sake,
you know, hypothetically...

217
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,176
...which one
would you be willing to give up?

218
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,772
Frank Jr. Jr.?

219
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,210
You'd be getting a really good one.

220
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,974
I mean, you know,
he's really funny.

221
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,689
Like, the other day,
he made up this joke:

222
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,058
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?

223
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,496
A talking frog.

224
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,697
Oh, no, you can't have him,
he's too funny.

225
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,253
Well, all right, that's fine.
What about Leslie?

226
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,496
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

227
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,209
She's the only one that knows how
to burp the alphabet.

228
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,138
All right, so that leaves Chandler.

229
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,412
No, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.

230
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,019
I got big hopes for her.

231
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,775
She's gonna be a doctor
or a realtor.

232
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,009
Wow, Frank,
I think we just ran out of kids.

233
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,131
Oh, I think you're right.

234
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,451
Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
I can give one of them up.

235
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,215
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.

236
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,777
I'm sorry, Frank,
I didn't realize things were so bad.

237
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,057
You know, I'll help out more.
I can babysit anytime you want.

238
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,812
You name the day and I'll be there.

239
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,255
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, that's not good.

240
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,212
But I can move some stuff around
and I'll be there.

241
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,496
You and Alice just take
the whole day together.

242
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,571
You'd do that for us?

243
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,930
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.

244
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,015
Oh, look at them.

245
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,779
I love you so much.

246
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,332
Oh, crap, don't wake up!
Don't wake up!

247
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,132
- Where are Bill and Colleen?
- Kitchen, getting something to eat.

248
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,813
Can you believe
how nice they are?

249
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,208
We have to leave.

250
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,573
Why?
What did you do in the bathroom?

251
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,459
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.

252
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,214
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...

253
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,699
...I may have told him.

254
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,257
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, I can replace everything in there.

255
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,729
- Get that binder and let's go!
- Hi.

256
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,337
Some little snacks for everybody.

257
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,378
You don't have to eat the sour worms.
Those are for Owen.

258
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,373
I'll go get him in a second.

259
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,777
By the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

260
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,536
But kids are so intuitive.

261
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,930
Don't you think, on some level,
he already knows?

262
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,337
- I'm adopted?
- See? Intuitive.

263
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,771
What? Where did you hear that?

264
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,049
He told me.

265
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,010
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

266
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,094
Which, technically,
now you should give back.

267
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,809
You told him he's adopted?

268
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,574
I'm sorry. You should have
a sign out there or something.

269
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,777
Or at least whisper it to people
when they come in the door.

270
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,296
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
and he also thinks Santa is real."

271
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,172
He isn't?

272
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,575
We have to get out of here, baby.

273
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,890
Everyone, I would like
to make a toast...

274
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,853
...to Rachel and Joey.

275
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,698
And to love.

276
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,619
Ah, love!

277
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,815
L-O-V-E. Love.

278
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,016
L is for "life."

279
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,648
And what is life without love?

280
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,134
Oh, my God, are we supposed
to answer?

281
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,697
O is for:

282
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,690
"Oh, wow!"

283
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,936
The V is for this...

284
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,934
...very surprising turn of events...

285
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,656
...which I am still fine with,
by the way.

286
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,371
E...

287
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,778
...is for how...

288
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,728
...extremely normal I find it...

289
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,936
...that you two...

290
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,334
...are together.

291
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,776
And that one day
you might get married...

292
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,738
...and have children of your own.

293
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,611
- Dude, are you okay?
- Totally.

294
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,899
Ross, you don't seem okay.

295
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,410
I'm sorry, it must be
the pressure of entertaining.

296
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,290
I think everyone would
feel better if we had some flan.

297
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,971
Wait, Ross. Ross, l...
I have to take off.

298
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,818
- No!
- I'm sorry.

299
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,289
I have an early class in the morning.

300
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,055
But this has been lovely.

301
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,659
Wasn't it? And you thought it
would be awkward with Joey.

302
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,095
And that you never
really liked Rachel.

303
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,258
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?

304
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,012
- Okay.
- All right.

305
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,096
God, Rachel, what Ross just said,
that's just...

306
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,575
That's okay.
Girls tend not to like me.

307
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,092
Fine.

308
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,769
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.

309
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,611
Hey, that rhymes.

310
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,817
You know what, Ross,
I think we're gonna take off too.

311
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,657
Of course. God, I'm so stupid.

312
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,299
You guys are a couple now.

313
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,815
I mean, you probably
just want to be alone.

314
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,490
- No, it's just getting late...
- It's fine. It's totally fine.

315
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,493
I've got plenty of margaritas.
It's all good.

316
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,134
I don't even know what that's for.

317
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,933
You know what?

318
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,132
I think I'm gonna stay here
and make sure he's okay.

319
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,332
- That's probably a good idea.
- I'll see you in the morning.

320
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,933
Okay.

321
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,136
Yeah, you know, Joey, l...

322
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,656
I don't think he's ever
gonna be okay with this.

323
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,976
It doesn't look good, does it?

324
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,539
Morning.

325
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,254
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

326
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,215
- Did you stay here all night?
- Yeah.

327
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,692
So you took off my pants and shoes?

328
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,413
No. No, no.

329
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,539
You actually did that when you
were dancing to the <i>Chicago</i> soundtrack.

330
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,572
Look, Ross...

331
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,050
...about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't
have to worry about that...

332
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,415
...because nothing's gonna happen.

333
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,850
What do you mean?

334
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,978
She and I said from the beginning...

335
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,938
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.

336
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,533
And clearly...

337
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,334
What are you talking about?
I'm fine.

338
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,135
It's okay, Ross.
You know, I totally understand.

339
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,939
Of course you're not fine. You're...

340
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,617
You're Ross and Rachel.

341
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,575
Yeah, except we're not.

342
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,696
I mean, we haven't been
a couple in, like...

343
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,775
...six years.

344
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,814
My God, is that right?

345
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,973
Has it been that long?

346
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,095
That's what I hear, yeah.

347
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,169
This is crazy.
I mean, six years...

348
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,491
...and because of me,
you guys aren't gonna be together?

349
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,697
Can I ask you something?

350
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,259
Really...

351
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,574
...what is this thing
with you and Rachel?

352
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,129
Come on, you know me.
You know...

353
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,449
Joey.

354
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,896
I'm crazy about her.

355
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,453
And she feels the same way?

356
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,331
I think so.

357
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,252
Well, then...

358
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,695
...maybe it's time
we all moved on.

359
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,688
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean,
you're not okay with it, so...

360
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,051
No, but I want to be.

361
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,532
I will be.

362
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,979
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?

363
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,529
Oh, my God,
I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?

364
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,294
- She didn't see the dance, did she?
- No, no, no.

365
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,935
No, that was...
That was just for me.

366
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,098
Hey, you...?

367
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,091
You sure about this?

368
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,860
Yeah, I'm sure.

369
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,334
And...

370
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,171
...we're okay?

371
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,938
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

372
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,692
We just want to give
you a heads up.

373
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,851
Bill and Colleen hate us.

374
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,335
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.

375
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,853
What?

376
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,857
Still, he had to find out sometime.

377
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,013
How would you like it if someone told
the triplets that you gave birth to them?

378
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,648
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.

1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,859
- So you and Rachel tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,385
Yeah, it's actually
our first official date.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,189
Wow, so tonight may be the night.
You nervous?

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,820
No. This is the part
I'm actually good at.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,546
What must it be like not to be
crippled by fear and self-Ioathing?

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,268
It's okay.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,500
How can you be so confident?

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,389
Well, I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,623
- Really? Like, you have a routine?
- No. See, each woman is different.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,543
You have to appreciate
their uniqueness.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,788
- Really?
- No, I do six things.

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,909
First, I look deep into her eyes,
then I kiss her.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,860
Next, I take my hand
and I softly graze her thigh.

14
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,782
You mean like this?

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,660
No, not like that. No, no.
No, like this:

16
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,426
I see what you mean.
That's quite nice.

17
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,384
- More foosball?
- And beer.

18
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,026
The One With Ross's Tan

19
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,586
- Hey.
- Hey.

20
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,786
Hey, sweetie.

21
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,386
Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.

22
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,384
No, no. Stop staring
at your sister's legs.

23
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,902
I'm sorry, it's just...
How'd you get so tan?

24
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,187
She went to one of those
spray-on tan places.

25
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,059
You got a spray-on tan?

26
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,539
Chandler gets pedicures!

27
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,828
What? You do?
Like, with the toe separators?

28
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,740
Why? Why?

29
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,462
I can't believe that's sprayed on.

30
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,667
I mean, it looks really good.
I wonder if I should get one.

31
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,028
Sure, then you should get a miniskirt
so you can really show it off.

32
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,263
So do you get colors
or just French tips?

33
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,464
- Here. Here's their card.
- Thanks.

34
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,860
Hey, I know where this place is.

35
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,225
It used to be an X-rated video...

36
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,784
Florist.

37
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,269
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

38
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,386
You won't believe
who moved back to town.

39
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,949
I know. Amanda.

40
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,227
- She called me too. She's the worst.
- Who's Amanda?

41
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,029
She's this girl who lived in the building
before you did.

42
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,341
Then she moved to England and
picked up this fake British accent.

43
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,660
On the machine, this is her message:

44
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,789
"Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling."

45
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,428
Are you trying to do a British accent?

46
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,629
Chandler gets pedicures.

47
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,380
Just so I know, how many more
of those can I expect?

48
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,185
Know what Amanda said
when she called me?

49
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,864
"Oh, so sorry to catch you
on your mobile."

50
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,707
If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile,
then don't call me on my mobile.

51
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,501
And she always brags about
all the famous people she's met.

52
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,069
Oh, I know!

53
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,983
"I slept with Billy Joel."

54
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,826
All right, who hasn't?

55
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,584
What are we gonna do?
I don't wanna see her.

56
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,342
Let's just cut her out.

57
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,149
- What?
- Cut her out of our lives.

58
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,700
Just ignore her calls
and dodge her till she gets the point.

59
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,704
Well, I guess we could try that.
But it seems so harsh.

60
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,465
- Have you ever done that?
- No. Had it done to me, though.

61
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,782
Feels good.

62
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,227
All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.

63
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,425
So how dark do you wanna be?
We have one, two or three.

64
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,865
Well, I like how you look.
What are you?

65
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,544
- Puerto Rican.
- Two. I think a two.

66
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,463
You'll face the red light.

67
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,305
When the light's on, the spraying's
about to start, so close your eyes.

68
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,904
When the spraying stops,
count to five...

69
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,949
...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
then turn to get your back. Got it?

70
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,262
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count and pat.

71
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,901
- You catch on quick.
- Well, I have a Ph.D., so...

72
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,222
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three...

73
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,265
Wait, wait!
I'm not... I'm not finished counting!

74
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,700
You sprayed my front twice!

75
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,061
- You never turned?
- No! I barely got to "three Mississippi"!

76
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,620
Mississippi? I said count to five.

77
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,028
Mississippi-less-ly?

78
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,387
Well, how bad is it?

79
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,747
Not that bad yet. But it gets
darker for the next four hours.

80
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,425
- So how dark will it get?
- You got sprayed with two twos and...

81
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,421
I'm a four?

82
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,381
Yeah, but your back's a zero.
You'll wanna even that out.

83
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,188
Really?

84
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,464
- You might wanna get back in there.
- Oh, okay!

85
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,869
Wait a minute,
there's no light on the back wall.

86
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,659
How do I know
when it's gonna start? Hello?

87
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,747
My eyes!

88
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,460
The same thing happened again!

89
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,383
- You got two more twos?
- I'm an eight!

90
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,064
Thanks for dinner.

91
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,744
I thought you paid.

92
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,743
Guess we won't be going back there.

93
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,058
- So...
- Yeah.

94
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,739
Hey, what do you say we move this
onto the likes of the couch?

95
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,708
I say cheesy line, but okay.

96
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,510
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

97
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,468
- I don't know why I did that.
- Okay.

98
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,303
Okay. Sorry.

99
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm sorry. Again, I don't know
what happened. I must be nervous.

100
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,906
I don't get it. Chandler loved it.

101
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,539
I promise. I won't do it again.
I really do. This is gonna be great.

102
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,621
- Okay.
- Okay.

103
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,863
Was that good for you?

104
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,099
No, don't get it.
Let the machine pick up.

105
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,580
Yeah, it could be Rachel asking
if someone could babysit again.

106
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,225
- It could be Amanda.
- Oh, you're right.

107
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,259
I was just kidding about Rachel.
Babysitting's a gas.

108
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,782
<i>Hello, Monica.</i>
<i>It's Amanda calling again.</i>

109
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,544
<i>I'm in the neighborhood,</i>
<i>hoping I could pop by your flat.</i>

110
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,703
You're from Yonkers!
Your last name is Buffamonteezi!

111
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,665
<i>Let's see.</i>
<i>So should you get this directly...</i>

112
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,263
<i>... ring me back on my mobile.</i>

113
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,466
Okay, don't hold thy breath.

114
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,939
<i>- Hello? Is someone on the line?</i>
<i>- Yes. I was looking for Monica.</i>

115
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,068
Hang on, she's right here.

116
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,461
- Someone's on the phone for you.
- We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.

117
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,420
I get pedicures.

118
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,387
Hi, Amanda.

119
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,179
Actually, now is not a good time.

120
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,984
Dinner tomorrow night?

121
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,465
Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.

122
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,019
Why? Why?
Why didn't you just say no?

123
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,739
Well, I said no to her coming over now.
I couldn't say no twice.

124
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,299
I got this uncontrollable need
to please people.

125
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,583
Fine. Fine. You would not
hold up well under torture.

126
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,059
- Oh, and you would?
- I did.

127
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,383
- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

128
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,745
It's just a little weird.
It's you, and it's me.

129
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,140
- It'll just take some getting used to.
- Okay.

130
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,349
Okay, well, how can
we make it easier?

131
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,350
Okay. Let's work from the top down.

132
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,823
- Just work the bra, Joe.
- Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.

133
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,979
- Okay.
- Okay.

134
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,306
- Is this thing welded shut?
- Okay.

135
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,545
All right, turn around.
I gotta get a look at this thing.

136
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,226
Sorry.

137
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,421
Well, this is romantic.

138
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,184
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.

139
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,183
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I could do it with one hand.

140
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,262
I could do it with my eyes closed.
Once I just looked at one...

141
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,546
...and it popped open.

142
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,983
- I blame your bra.
- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.

143
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,149
Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping.

144
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,269
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
about that, Joey.

145
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,619
But do you think maybe, on some level,
you don't want to take off my bra?

146
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,060
No, I don't have another level.

147
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,618
Hold on. There's something different.

148
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,187
I went to that tanning place
your wife suggested.

149
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,308
Was that place the sun?

150
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,701
Oh, and it gets worse.

151
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,868
Oh, my God, you can do a duet
of "Ebony and Ivory" all by yourself.

152
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,024
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.

153
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,829
You go in the booth,
count to five and turn around.

154
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,265
- How do you count to five?
- One, two, three...

155
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,783
Damn it!

156
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,423
I know!

157
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,268
What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

158
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,028
How was your date with Joey?

159
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,581
Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.

160
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,265
And then we were fooling around and
he started to put his hand up my leg...

161
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,022
...and I kept slapping it away.

162
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,464
You didn't like that?

163
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,069
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
He freaked out too.

164
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,902
He couldn't even undo my bra.

165
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,341
Really? One time he just looked
at my bra and it popped open.

166
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,820
I do not know what's wrong with us.

167
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,220
We've kissed before
and that's been great.

168
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,387
But this time
it was leading somewhere...

169
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,906
...and I was very aware of the fact
that it was Joey touching me.

170
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,901
You guys have been friends forever.

171
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,504
The first time you kissed Ross
was weird.

172
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,628
You couldn't stop laughing.
You got through that.

173
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,066
Okay. That's true.
That's true, we can do this.

174
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,427
You're right. We can do this.
We'll just power through.

175
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,706
Chandler, can I talk to you
for a second?

176
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,340
No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.

177
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,699
Chandler, stop.
It's not going to pop open.

178
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,383
You don't know.

179
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,823
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Hey.

180
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,140
- Is Amanda here yet?
- No.

181
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,104
I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting
her out" plan, but I have a new plan.

182
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,262
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.

183
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,422
Okay, what kind of emergency
gets us both out of here?

184
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,139
What do you think of Mike and Chandler
being in a car accident?

185
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,309
- Are you kidding? I love it!
- Okay.

186
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,939
- Hi.
- Hi.

187
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,467
Hello!

188
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,661
It's so nice to see you.

189
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,789
Both of you, look at me.
Look how young I look!

190
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:36,150
Oh, gosh, we have
so much to catch up on.

191
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,430
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.

192
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,309
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.

193
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,588
- Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's...
- Oh, smell my neck.

194
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,824
It's not perfume. It's me.
It's my natural scent.

195
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,542
Musty.

196
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,463
Gosh, this is brilliant.
Gosh, it's just like old times.

197
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,190
I'm so happy you two
are friends again.

198
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,469
- When were we not friends?
- Well, it was 1992.

199
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,226
And I remember, because that was
the year I had sex with Evel Knievel.

200
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,228
We were friends in 1992.

201
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,427
No, I distinctly remember
you were dodging her calls...

202
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,660
...and trying to avoid seeing her.

203
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,663
- You were going to cut me out?
- Well, kind of.

204
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,741
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, bugger.

205
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:34,223
Should I not have said that?
I feel like a perfect arse.

206
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,464
Well, in America, you're just an ass.

207
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,582
Hello?

208
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,581
Chandler, what's wrong?

209
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,783
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

210
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,987
I'm so sorry,
but Chandler was in a car accident.

211
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,663
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

212
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,549
- Was Mike with him?
- Nope.

213
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,819
- Got the champagne?
- Yes. Ready to power through.

214
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,823
Excellent. Put it on ice,
the phone is off the hook...

215
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,619
...and, in the interest
of powering through...

216
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,947
Okay, sexy, sexy...

217
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,308
...very sexy. Sexy.
All right, let's do it!

218
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,586
Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.

219
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,344
Get over it, soldier,
we gotta do this.

220
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,062
- Okay. You like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

221
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,348
You like that?
Let's kick this into high gear, huh?

222
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,061
Yeah, baby!
I'll show you how we do it!

223
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,504
No, no, no!

224
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,342
You kneed me in my misters!

225
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,106
What? Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

226
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,030
Joey? Are you okay?

227
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,421
Soldier down.

228
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,180
We are not friends
with Phoebe anymore.

229
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,822
If she asks,
I protested a little, but okay.

230
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,578
Chandler, thank God you're alive.
Monica, can I talk to you outside?

231
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,222
- I have nothing to say to you.
- My flat is twice this size.

232
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,382
Please, Monica, in the hall?

233
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,065
Oh, that accident
must have been terrible.

234
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,461
You look positively ghastly.

235
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,618
Well, aren't you a treat.

236
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,740
I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
Why, Phoebe? Why?

237
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,105
It was right after we
were living together...

238
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,062
...and you were driving me crazy,
okay?

239
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,859
You were really controlling
and compulsive and shrill.

240
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,863
Well, I'm still all those things!

241
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,701
You're also so generous
and kind and scrappy.

242
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,266
I am scrappy.

243
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,708
Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.

244
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,383
Of all the people I've cut out...

245
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,747
...you were the only one
who ever clawed her way back in.

246
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,786
That's because I'm scrappy.

247
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,226
Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that
you fought your way back in...

248
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,779
...because I don't know what
I would do without you.

249
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,023
I don't know what
I would do without you.

250
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,305
Well, I guess we should go back in.
I mean, you gave me another chance.

251
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,349
- We should do the same for Amanda.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

252
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,506
Can you believe it? I've never had
any professional dance training.

253
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,309
Let me explain how this works.
Go in the booth and...

254
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,861
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Glenda. Okay?

255
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,669
Does it look like this is
my first time?

256
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:08,029
Now, I want four two's,
and I want them all on my back.

257
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,149
Okay.

258
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,142
Wait. There's two sets of nozzles!
Which one is it? Which one is it?

259
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,145
Oh, son of a bitch!

260
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,103
What is the matter with us?

261
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,029
Well, I know what's
the matter with me.

262
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,468
No, I mean with us, you know?
I mean, is it supposed to be this...

263
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,548
...difficult?

264
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,942
I don't know.

265
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,382
That fake British woman's a real bitch,
but she sure can dance.

266
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,869
- Hey.
- Hi.

267
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,069
Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up...

268
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,746
...was it weird going from friends
to more than that?

269
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,343
Kind of. Sneaking around,
having to hide from you guys...

270
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,705
No, no, no. No, I mean...

271
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,462
...sexually.

272
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:21,385
Yeah, was there a part
of you that felt like it was...

273
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,700
...really wrong?

274
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,469
Actually, no.
No, it felt right, you know?

275
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:32,748
It felt like, "I can't believe we haven't
been doing this the whole time."

276
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,059
I can tell from your expressions that's
the good news you were hoping for.

277
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,267
Well, I'm gonna go continue
to spread the joy.

278
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,739
Just because it happened that way
for them doesn't mean it has to for us.

279
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,502
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

280
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,986
I mean, just because something's
difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

281
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,822
- Right, totally.
- Yeah. And so...

282
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,705
...we'll just keep trying
and trying until we do it.

283
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,304
If not, we'll just be a couple
that never has sex.

284
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,028
That's a plan.

285
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,941
- I did not see this coming.
- I know.

286
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:34,101
I don't know, I don't get it. I mean,
I was so sure this is what I wanted.

287
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,622
Me too.

288
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,747
Well, how come Monica and Chandler
could do it?

289
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,421
I guess they weren't
as good friends as we are.

290
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,660
I bet you're right.

291
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,062
So...

292
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,148
Yeah.

293
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,908
I love you.

294
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,740
Love you too.

295
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,546
- All right, I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

296
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,338
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere
for a while.

297
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,988
- Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
- Go away!

298
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,588
I don't wanna see anybody!

299
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,902
I went to the tanning place and the
same thing happened to me. Let me in.

300
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,549
Really?

301
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,628
Did you count Mississippi-ly?

302
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,424
You're not tan.

303
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:00,539
No. I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later.

00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,242
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,924
Honey, I got us that room at the
Woodford Inn this weekend.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,759
That place in Vermont?
You can take a hint.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,319
You can't go away this weekend.
It's Emma's birthday.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,843
We're having a party.

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,921
Can't you have the party
when we get back?

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,050
No. It won't be her real birthday.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,204
Gee, if only she were 1 and had
no idea what the hell a birthday was.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,925
Come on, you guys,
this is really important to us.

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,968
Sorry, but Chandler and I
could really use a weekend away...

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,043
...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
- There's this thing I really want us to do.

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,007
I read about it in <i>Maxim</i>.

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,048
Well, can't you just go
to Vermont the next day?

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,882
Yeah, we want everyone to be there.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,044
As much as I hate to delay your doing
weird sex stuff to my little sister.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,724
And, I mean, you know, you guys,
this is a big deal.

17
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,849
How can we have her first birthday party
without her aunt and her uncle?

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,320
All right, we'll stay.
We can just drive up after the party.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,607
Fine. But if we end up not doing
this <i>Maxim</i> thing because of this party...

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,125
Believe me, that is not why
we won't be doing that.

21
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,841
The One With the Cake

22
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,198
You know, Pheebs, when I was little,
on my birthday...

23
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,407
...my daddy would hide a present
in every room of the house.

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,448
And then he would draw a treasure map
to help me find them all.

25
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,609
I love family traditions like that.

26
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,807
When Ursula and I were kids,
on our birthday...

27
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,009
...our stepdad would sell his blood
to buy us food.

28
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,969
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

29
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,042
- I brought the camera for Emma's video.
- Oh, good!

30
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,599
We had this idea to make
a birthday video for Emma...

31
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,409
...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
- Oh, cool.

32
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,800
- Wow, it's like a time capsule.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,326
Oh, just think, she's gonna be
watching that video on a TV...

34
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,050
...that hasn't even been invented yet...

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,283
...with friends who, right now,
are just, like, babies.

36
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,159
And they'll be living in a floating city
that the humans built...

37
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,888
...to escape the ant people.

38
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,405
That's the hope.

39
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,364
- So is Emma awake yet?
- No, it's still naptime.

40
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,248
- But she'll be up soon.
- Where's Joey?

41
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,526
I said, it's still naptime.

42
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,728
- Hey, there's Uncle Joey.
- Hey.

43
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,768
Hey, say something to Emma
on her 18th birthday.

44
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,403
- Eighteen, huh?
- Joey, no!

45
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,006
What? What? It's for her hot friends.

46
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,206
When they see this, you'll be 52.

47
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,442
And starting to think about
settling down.

48
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,841
Joey, will you please set this up
for people to put Emma's presents on?

49
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,889
Love to. Yeah.

50
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,807
- We were supposed to bring presents?
- Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.

51
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,165
Oh, yeah.
How was I supposed to know?

52
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,447
- Joey, it's a birthday party.
- Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old.

53
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,001
What's the point? The other day
she laughed for an hour at a cup.

54
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,845
Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it,
dressed as a farmer.

55
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,482
And he's standing next to this cow,
and the cow says, "El-moo."

56
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,518
Man, that's a funny cup.

57
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,323
- Hey.
- Hey.

58
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,243
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Oh, she's still napping.

59
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,120
She was probably up all night excited
about the party she knows is happening.

60
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,965
I know you guys really want to get to
Vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you.

61
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,964
But it really is to us, okay? Emma
will never have a first birthday again.

62
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,202
You're right. We're sorry.

63
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,565
Let's wake up Emma
and get the fun time started!

64
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,244
She didn't sleep well last night,
so we can't wake her.

65
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,685
Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?

66
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,918
- Hi!
- Hey!

67
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,207
- I'm so glad you came.
- I can't believe Emma's already 1.

68
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,520
I remember your first birthday.

69
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,523
Ross was jealous of all the attention
we were giving you.

70
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,648
He pulled on his testicles so hard...

71
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,643
...we had to take him
to the emergency room.

72
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,484
There's something you didn't know
about your dad.

73
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,403
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Geller.
Let me help you with that.

74
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,602
- Thank you.
- Oh, man, this is great, huh?

75
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,160
The three of us together again.
You know what would be fun?

76
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,562
If we gave this present to Emma
from all of us.

77
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,883
Which one are you?

78
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,049
- I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
- I know. What are we gonna do?

79
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,962
I've got a plan. I've got a plan.

80
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,408
I'm going to ram this platter
really hard into your ribs.

81
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,727
You're gonna scream out,
and that'll wake her up.

82
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm not going to Vermont
with this Monica.

83
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,808
Hey, Pheebs? You know what?

84
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,801
I was thinking
since you wrote a song...

85
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,803
...maybe I could do something
for Emma using my talents.

86
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,438
So you're gonna hit on her?

87
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,922
No, no, no. My talents as an actor.

88
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,126
You know, I could, like, maybe...

89
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,487
I could do a dramatic reading
of one of her books.

90
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,767
Or you could stick a fork in an apple.

91
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,406
- Hey, I think Emma might like it.
- Oh, Emma might like what?

92
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,004
- My present.
- What did you get her?

93
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,809
- We prepared performances.
- Separate performances.

94
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,120
But equally real.

95
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,121
That sounds like fun.

96
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,841
People are getting a little antsy waiting
for Emma to wake up from her nap.

97
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,285
So would you mind
performing them once now?

98
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,963
- Sure, yeah!
- Okay.

99
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,566
Okay. All right. Everybody,
let's get this party started.

100
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,528
Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform
a little something for us.

101
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,282
Oh, great.

102
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,123
Aren't you gonna be embarrassed
having nothing prepared?

103
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,767
I do it every week with three cameras
pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.

104
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,405
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?

105
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,643
I will be doing a dramatic reading
of one of Emma's books.

106
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,961
Oh, okay. Which one?

107
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,724
Well, it's one of her favorites.

A mother held her new baby

...back and forth, back and forth,
back and forth.

'I'll love you forever.

I'll like you for always.

Oh, wow!

122
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,289
That was amazing.

123
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,288
Thank you so much for that gift.

124
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,162
I was not ready for this today.

125
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,204
- Amazing. Amazing.
- Phoebe, I'm sorry.

126
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,930
- Phoebe has prepared something as well.
- That's right.

127
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,844
I prepared a song for Emma,
from my heart to hers.

128
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,447

than the gift of music.

<i>Happy birthday Emma!</i>

133
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,286
Is that it?

134
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,520
No, of course not.

135
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,569
No, I've also, you know,
prepared a reading.

136
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,043
"<i>Sex and the Single Mother</i>."

137
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,642
- "Finding your G-spot."
- Oh, no, no, no!

138
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,804
Hello, Emma. Happy 18th birthday.

139
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,007
Right now, that seems so far away,
17 years.

140
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,960
Yes. You'll be all grown up
by then, and we'll be...

141
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,439
Well, your grandfather and I
might not be here.

142
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,919
That's true. This message
could be coming to you...

143
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,558
...from beyond the grave, Emma.

144
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,248
- After all, my parents died very young.
- And my cholesterol's off the charts.

145
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,123
Remember, Emma,
heart disease kills women too.

146
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,124
Okay, cut! Great. Great.
That was just...

147
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,406
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

148
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,959
Ross, don't forget to get a shot
of Emma's cake.

149
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,041
- It's in a box in the fridge.
- Okay, sure.

150
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,169
You're gonna love this cake. I got it
from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's.

151
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,481
Oh, my God, that place has
the creamiest frosting!

152
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,800
I used to hitchhike there
when I was a kid.

153
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,201
Well, anyway, they make
these great novelty cakes...

154
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,648
...in all different shapes. And if you give
them a photo, they'll copy it in icing.

155
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,928
- Did you do a picture of Emma?
- Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.

156
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,765
Rach? Does this bakery
by any chance also bake...

157
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,363
...erotic cakes?

158
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,086
Say, for bachelorette parties?

159
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,322
Ross, what are you talking...?
Oh, my God!

160
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,765
They put my baby's face on a penis!

161
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,489
Now it's a party!

162
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,167
Wait, you guys, this isn't funny.

163
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,527
If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,
I would have baked it myself!

164
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,643
Is it okay that I still think
it looks delicious?

165
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,925
- Jack, look at this.
- I know what you're thinking, Judy.

166
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,207
The resemblance is uncanny.

167
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,120
I am this close to tugging
on my testicles again.

168
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,002
No, no, this is not what I ordered,
okay?

169
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,958
I went all the way to New Jersey
so that I could have the perfect cake...

170
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,884
...for my daughter's birthday.
And I need a bunny cake right now!

171
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,799
Ask them if it would be faster
if we cut the baby's face off the penis...

172
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,530
...so we could put it on the bunny.

173
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,158
That is a weird sentence.

174
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,486
Oh, believe you me,
I am going to bring this cake back.

175
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,845
I don't even want it in my home.
Don't touch it!

176
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,921
I'm so confused!

177
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,400
Yes, I still want my daughter's picture,
but on a bunny cake!

178
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,004
Yellow cake, chocolate frosting
with nuts!

179
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,888
To be fair, this one does have nuts.

180
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,965
Mon, it was nice of you
to loan Rachel your car...

181
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,327
...so she could get the cake.
- It was nice of her to pull my hair...

182
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,048
...till I dropped the key.

183
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,002
Well, while we're waiting,
you could tape your message to Emma...

184
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,560
...for her 18th birthday, huh? Okay?

185
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,290
Hi, Emma. It's the year 2020.

186
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,247
Are you still enjoying your nap?

187
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,839
We're Aunt Monica
and Uncle Chandler, by the way.

188
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,284
You may not recognize us...

189
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,806
...because we haven't spoken
to your parents in 17 years.

190
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,244
We used to be married.

191
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,085
But then we missed a weekend away
together, and things kind of unraveled...

192
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,639
...because of you.

193
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,926
Happy birthday.

194
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,765
Ross, Rachel promised
it would be over by now.

195
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,319
We seriously have to go
if we want to get to Vermont.

196
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,483
- The last train leaves in a half-hour.
- And I have a massage client soon.

197
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,118
You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.

198
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,850
I promise, Rachel will be back
with the cake any minute.

199
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,446
Monica, remember the frosting, huh?

200
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,840
All right, five more minutes.

201
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,728
Hello?

202
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,801
Oh, no, what happened?

203
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,643
Okay, okay, where are you?

204
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,846
Okay, I'll be right there.

205
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,523
Was that Emma? Is she up?

206
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,607
Rachel got pulled over for speeding.

207
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,125
She forgot her license.
I have to bring it to her.

208
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,125
- lf you're leaving, I'm definitely going.
- Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!

209
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,360
We've been complaining the longest!

210
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,809
No, wait, you guys.
No, you can't leave.

211
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,279
Rachel already feels bad
that the cake's messed up.

212
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,487
How do you think she'll feel
when she comes back and you're gone?

213
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,084
I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday.

214
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,039
Joey, you're in charge, okay?
You make sure nobody leaves.

215
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,041
Got it!

216
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,121
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?

217
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,564
To the bathroom.

218
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,008
Well, the rest of you get comfortable,
because we are gonna be here for a...

219
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,119
- Wait, there's a window in there.
- No! He's not getting away that easy!

220
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,361
What are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!

221
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,368
Well, that one did not have
Emma's face on it.

222
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,168
- No, it did not.
- No.

223
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,281
Well, we'd better get going. It's late.

224
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,806
Jack can't drive at night anymore.
He has trouble staying in his lane.

225
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,758
Last winter I went up on a church lawn
and drove right through a manger scene.

226
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,160
The papers thought it was
a hate crime.

227
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,444
- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
- Okay.

228
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,680
- Bye. Bye, dear.
- Nighty-night.

229
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,966
- Nighty-night.
- Bye.

230
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,644
- How could you just let them leave?
- Hey, hey, hey.

231
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,519
I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's
a great man. He fought for our country.

232
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,887
No, he didn't. He pretended to be
a Quaker to get out of Korea.

233
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:18,285
Well, that's it. He's the last one to go.
I'm locking you guys in.

234
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,840
You do know I can just turn them
the other way around, right?

235
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,365
Oh, I forgot you used to live here.

236
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,918
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Estelle.

237
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,162
- Hey.
<i>- So how'd your audition go today?</i>

238
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,527
- What audition?
- The one I told you about last week.

239
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,682
What? You never said anything
about an audition.

240
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,602
Let me start over.
I just got a call about an audition.

241
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,327
<i>I think you can still make it.</i>

242
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,278
It's down at the Astor Theater, and you
need to have a monologue prepared.

243
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,118
A monologue? I don't have a...

244
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,286
I got it.

245
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,326
So I'm gonna take off.

246
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,004
- What?
- No, wait! You don't get to leave.

247
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,162
I've got a massage client waiting
outside my door any minute.

248
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,163
And we paid for a room
that we're supposed to be in right now!

249
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,803
Well, okay, now...

250
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,325
...only one of us has to stay
with Emma.

251
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,723
Okay, and as the person
who realized that, I get to go.

252
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,721
No, no, no. No. No.

253
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,688
Let's figure out a fair way
to decide who's staying.

254
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,761
Oh, I got it.

255
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,888
Okay, everyone pick a number from
one to 10, all right?

256
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,439
Whoever gets the highest number
gets to go first.

257
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,885
- Okay, 10.
- Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.

258
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,324
Anyone else?

259
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,040
- No, let's just draw straws.
- Okay.

260
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,440
Or we could flip a coin
and multiply the answer...

261
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,044
- I'm begging you to stop.
- Right.

262
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,566
Okay, how about this?
We got wind-up toys for Emma.

263
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,961
We can make them race,
and whoever comes in last stays.

264
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,286
Yeah, let's do that!

265
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,249
That sounds more fun than the thing
we were gonna do in Vermont!

266
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,120
- Okay, everybody, pick your toys!
- Okay. I want the dolphin!

267
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,282
- That's a bear!
- I'm too excited!

268
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,683
Phoebe, you get the bear.
Joey, you get the robot.

269
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,806
- Oh, yeah.
- And Chandler and I get the dog.

270
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,202
And the race is going to go
from here to here.

271
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,487
Now, the one who comes in last stays!

272
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,720
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
wind your toys.

273
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,929
- Okay. On your mark, get set, go!
- Go! Go!

274
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,365
Come on, robot!

275
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,727
What are you barking at?

276
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,725
Well, how is that gonna help?

277
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,719
I bought you! How did I forget
that that's all you do?

278
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,120
Way to go, robot!

279
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,839
Good job, Alan.

280
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,525
- Hey, good race, you guys.
- Yeah, see you later.

281
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,601
No. No, no. Wait.

282
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,123
We didn't lose.

283
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,682
The rules clearly stated that the last one
to cross the finish line was the loser.

284
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,887
Well, our dog never crossed
the finish line. So technically...

285
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,967
They left.

286
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,128
There isn't time to go to the bakery.
We're gonna come home.

287
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,885
Everybody left?

288
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,565
All right. Well, just tell Emma that
we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.

289
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,321
- Rachel!
- Oh, God, sorry!

290
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,766
I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
You're such a good driver.

291
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,721
- Emma's awake.
- Yeah?

292
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,482
I can't believe this.

293
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,960
This is her first birthday, she's awake,
we're not even there.

294
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,247
Everybody left. We still have
this stupid obscene cake.

295
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,800
Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know,
try to turn it into something else.

296
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,530
Oh, don't even bother.

297
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,045
We've already ruined
her first birthday.

298
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,249
And do you know how important these
early experiences are, Ross? Very!

299
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,288
According to the back cover
of that book that you gave me.

300
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,725
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.

301
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,842
I guess.

302
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,083
Oh, I just had such an idea of what
this day would be like, you know?

303
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,320
Emma laughing...

304
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,449
...and everybody gathered around
her cake, singing "Happy Birthday."

305
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,280
And then we would all... Hey, get out
of the road, you stupid student driver!

306
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,884
They have to learn.

307
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,009
- Hey.
- What?

308
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,206
This is not bad.

309
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,966
Oh, my God. Look, you made it
into a bunny. How did you do that?

310
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,088
Well, I just made these
two things cheeks.

311
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,366
And then I split this to make ears.

312
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,040
Well, I am very impressed.

313
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,007
Some can sing, some can dance.

314
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,560
I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
into woodland creatures.

315
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,128
Now, another way to organize
your stuffed animals is by size.

316
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,168
I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma
or for Monica?

317
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,922
Game?

318
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,288
Emma, do you even know it's
your birthday today? You're 1.

319
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,089
One year old. That's little.

320
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,960
That's my girl.

321
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,045
That's how old you are.

322
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,486
Did I teach her that?
Did I just impart wisdom?

323
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,522
I want one.

324
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,641
Me too.

325
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,565
There's no one around.
Why don't we just take this one?

326
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,046
- And head to Canada.
- I was kidding.

327
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,609
I wasn't. Let's get going.

328
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,168
- Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
- No, not yet.

329
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,879
- Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.
- What about your massage client?

330
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,805
I just felt so bad missing this. So I just
slipped him a little something, you know.

331
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,007
As long as I'm back in five
or six hours, it'll be all right.

332
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,409
Okay.

333
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,643
If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been
here the whole time. The whole time.

334
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,045
I've been here the whole time.

335
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,438
Joey, we just saw you come in.
You ran past us on the stairs.

336
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,284
I don't care that you left. I'm just glad
that you're here. Thanks, you guys.

337
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,159
Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see
what Emma just did.

338
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,480
- What?
- Emma, how old are you?

339
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,322
How old are you today?

340
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,127
Emma, that's right. You're that many.

341
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,850
Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.

342
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,762
- This means...
- No! No science camp!

343
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,367
Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.

344
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:51,082
Oh, and, Emma, look at your
stuffed animals lined up so neatly.

345
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,128
Thanks.

346
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,442
Okay, here we go.

347
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,002
Emma's first birthday cake.

348
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,568
Go ahead, Emma,
blow out the candle.

349
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,198
Come on, Emma. You can do it.

350
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,362
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, nothing.

351
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,964
These are happy tears.

352
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,280
This is just what I wanted.

353
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,607
Hey, you made it into a bunny.

354
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,961
What is wrong with me? It looked
more delicious when it was a penis.

355
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,282
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

356
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,248
- And record.
- Okay.

357
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,608
Hi, Emma.
Well, your first birthday is over, and...

358
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,761
Go! Go! Come on!

359
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,325
Go! Go! Come on!

360
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,529
Go! Go, Alan!
Run, you hairy bastard!

1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:04,937
You know, I'm thinking about letting
Emma have her first cookie.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,660
Her first cookie?
She has cookies all the time.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,489
I've never given her a cookie.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,171
- Have you?
- No.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,169
No. And for the record, I've also
never given her frosting from a can.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,612
Hey, Rach, the adoption agency
needs letters of recommendation...

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,010
...and we wondered
if you would write one for us?

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,178
- Of course. I would be honored.
- Thank you.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,418
I think there's been an oversight.

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,657
We would have asked you.
We thought you wouldn't be interested.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,291
It's just that we don't think of you
as really being so much with the words.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,698
Clearly, we were wrong.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,534
I got a lot of nice stuff
to say about you guys, okay?

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,975
I know how much you want
to have a baby...

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,370
...and I would love
to help you get one.

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,211
You know what?
Then we want you to do it.

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,770
Thank you. All right.
Let me see how I'm gonna start.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,254
"Dear Baby Adoption Decider People..."

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,050
So excited about your letter.

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,937
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,888
- Wow, don't you look nice.
- Yes, I do.

22
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,255
Today's Mike and my
one-year anniversary.

23
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,939
What's it the anniversary of?

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,775
Your first date, your first kiss,
first time you had sex?

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,129
Yeah.

26
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,813
So you must be going somewhere
fancy to celebrate.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,256
A Knicks game.

28
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,172
Aren't you a little overdressed?

29
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,456
I've never had a one-year
anniversary before...

30
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,379
...so no matter where we go,
I'm wearing something fancy...

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,371
...I'm gonna put on
my finest jewelry...

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,293
...and we're gonna have sex
in a public restroom.

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,094
You guys do that?

34
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,093
Chandler won't even have sex
in our bathroom.

35
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,015
That's where people
make number two.

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,930
The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits

37
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,616
So, you know, I have a little time
if you want to...

38
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,493
I'd love to, but I really have
to grade these papers.

39
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,213
Fine. It's fine.

40
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,257
I'll just shower by myself.

41
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,858
B. B. B. B. B.

42
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,336
You gave a B
to a Pottery Barn catalog.

43
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,100
Well, it had some good ideas.
Take off your shirt.

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,169
- Damn it.
- Rachel, open up! It's your sister!

45
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,570
I have to talk to you.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,218
Hi, Amy.

47
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,052
- You're not Rachel.
- Still sharp as a tack.

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,736
Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy.
Amy, this is Charlie.

49
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,931
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi.

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,328
And you are?

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,015
Ross? I grew up on your block?

52
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,295
We had Thanksgiving together
last year?

53
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,297
I had a baby with your sister?

54
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,092
No. I...

55
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,740
Did I buy a falafel
from you yesterday?

56
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,170
Yes. Yes, you did.

57
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,771
Hi, Rachel.
Here's your sister Amy.

58
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,374
She thinks I need pec implants.

59
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,612
Amy? Hi.

60
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,771
- You remember Joey.
- Yeah. Hey, sure.

61
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,408
- The <i>Days of our Lives</i> guy.
- That's right, yeah.

62
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,891
You are not good.

63
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,374
Always nice to meet a fan.

64
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,889
- So, now, what are you doing here?
- Well, I have huge news.

65
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,332
- Hold on. Let me check on the baby.
- This is important. Can't Ella wait?

66
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,456
Her name is Emma.

67
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,453
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.

68
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,569
What do I know? I just sell
Middle Eastern food from a cart.

69
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,856
Hey, your English is getting better.

70
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,419
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

71
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,696
She may be the hottest girl
I've ever hated.

72
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,576
- What you working on?
- Monica and Chandler's recommendation.

73
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,937
I want it to sound smart, but I don't
know any big words or anything.

74
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,849
- Why don't you use your thesaurus?
- What did I just say?

75
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,613
Watch.

76
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,774
Here, highlight the word you want
to change, go under "tools"...

77
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,852
...and the thesaurus generates...
Gives.

78
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,535
Gives a whole list of choices.

79
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,055
You can pick the word
that sounds smartest.

80
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,529
My God, that's great. I'm smart.

81
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,019
No, no, I'm:

82
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,536
"Brainy, bright, clever."
I love this thing!

83
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,056
Look out, ladies!
Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!

84
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,819
God...

85
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,409
...so beautiful.

86
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,093
I know, isn't she?

87
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,490
No, I was talking about your bedding.

88
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,688
All right, what's your news, Amy?

89
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,133
Well...

90
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,018
...I'm getting married.

91
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,250
Wow! Oh, my God!

92
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,980
- To who?
- This guy.

93
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,334
He has a killer apartment.

94
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,690
- And...?
- And it's on Fifth.

95
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,738
And the elevator opens up
right into the living room.

96
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,898
- No, what's he like?
- Oh, he's okay.

97
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,776
Do you remember
my old boyfriend Mark?

98
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,097
- Yeah.
- It's his dad.

99
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,810
- Wow, so he's gotta be...
- Old? Yeah.

100
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,413
But he travels a lot,
so he's hardly ever there.

101
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,094
Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
it sounds a little bit like...

102
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,694
...you like the apartment
more than you like...

103
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,094
Myron.

104
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,012
Yeah, I told you he was old.

105
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,696
Sit down. Sit down.

106
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,373
Honey, you know...

107
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,418
...I once also almost married
somebody that I didn't love.

108
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,855
- Do you remember Barry?
- Remember him?

109
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,411
God, we used to make out all the time
after you went to sleep.

110
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,900
Sometimes just nodding is okay.

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,579
But anyway, listen.

112
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,375
Not marrying Barry was the best
decision that I ever, ever made.

113
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,533
Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
Your soul mate is out there somewhere.

114
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,410
Someone that is your age,
that is smart, that is fun...

115
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,299
...and that you care about.

116
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,094
You're right.

117
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,410
- You're right. I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.

118
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,050
I'm gonna marry Myron
and keep looking for Mr. Right.

119
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,531
Okay, let's keep talking.

120
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,778
Excuse me. Anniversary.

121
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,978
Excuse me. Anniversary.

122
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,772
Sir, could you move your nachos?
They're in my seat.

123
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,770
It's my anniversary.

124
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,452
Here we are.

125
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,817
- I can't believe it's been a whole year.
- I know.

126
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,572
This has been the best year...

127
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,258
- This has been the best year of my life!
- Me too!

128
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,894
I never thought I could
love someone this much!

129
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,011
I feel the same way!

130
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,498
You're so generous and kind,
and you're amazing in bed!

131
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,652
It's our anniversary.

132
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,454
<i>Knicks fans, please turn your attention</i>
<i>to the big screen on the scoreboard.</i>

133
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,417
<i>Someone has a special question to ask.</i>

134
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,137
How lame.
It's so tacky and impersonal.

135
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,690
- Really?
- It's the worst way to propose.

136
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,174
Excuse me.

137
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,898
I finished my recommendation.
Here.

138
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,293
And I think you'll be very, very happy.

139
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,736
It's the longest I ever spent
on a computer without looking at porn.

140
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,133
I don't understand.

141
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,092
Some of the words a little
too sophisticated for you?

142
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,691
It doesn't make any sense.

143
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,973
Well, of course it does. It's smart.
I used a thesaurus.

144
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,492
On every word?

145
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,812
Yep.

146
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,815
All right, what was
this sentence originally?

147
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,979
"They are warm, nice people
with big hearts."

148
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,970
And that became, "They are humid,
prepossessing <i>Homo sapiens...</i>

149
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,291
...with full-sized aortic pumps."

150
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,097
Yeah. Yeah. And hey,
I really mean it, dude.

151
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,260
All right, Joey,
I don't think we can use this.

152
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,530
- Why not?
- Well, because you signed it:

153
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,533
"Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani."

154
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,296
Why don't you stop worrying about
sounding smart and just be yourself.

155
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,099
You don't need a thesaurus.
Just write from here.

156
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,137
Your full-sized aortic pump.

157
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,329
- Amy. Hi.
- I took your advice.

158
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,537
- I left Myron.
- Good for you!

159
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,698
I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.

160
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,898
Yes, you are.

161
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,018
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

162
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,738
So can I stay with you?

163
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,376
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

164
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,850
Look who's back.

165
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,329
Why do you have bags?
Why does she have bags?

166
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,259
I'm staying with you guys.

167
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,451
- What?
- We're gonna be roomies!

168
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,649
Come on.

169
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,853
- You slept out here?
- Yeah.

170
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,854
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
yelling, "Myron, get off!"

171
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,728
But we're getting rid of her, right?
Please tell me we're getting rid of her?

172
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,090
- Joey, I can't do that.
- Oh, come on.

173
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,933
Last night I was finishing off a pizza,
and she said:

174
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,409
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips."

175
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,579
I don't need that kind of talk
in my house!

176
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,651
Joey, look,
I know that she's difficult...

177
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,380
...but I think it's really good
that she's here.

178
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,697
Because we'll appreciate it
more when she's gone?

179
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,093
No, it's just... Look, when I first moved
to this city, I was a lot like her.

180
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,532
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.

181
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,571
Yeah. Monica made us.

182
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,891
Well, whatever.
I really appreciate it...

183
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,018
...because I don't think I would be
the person I am today...

184
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,932
...if it wasn't for you guys.

185
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,568
So I want to help Amy
the way you guys helped me.

186
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,891
And I know it's gonna take patience,
but that's okay.

187
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,454
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,934
That's what I'm wearing today.
That's why I hung it on the door.

189
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,570
Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.

190
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,536
You know what? I was thinking that
maybe now would be a good time...

191
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,329
...for us to sit down and, you know,
talk about your future.

192
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,253
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows shaped.

193
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,819
I am not happy.

194
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,975
Sure you want to eat that?

195
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,779
I'm curvy and I like it!

196
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,298
- Hi.
- Hi.

197
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,020
I just had the worst anniversary ever.

198
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,250
I doubt that.
Tell her about us last year.

199
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,534
Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.

200
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,055
- Seriously?
- Word.

201
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,534
Mine was worse than that.

202
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,770
- Well, what happened?
- We were at the game.

203
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,659
This guy proposed to his girlfriend
on the big screen thing.

204
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,334
- That is so tacky.
- Well, that's what I said.

205
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,016
But it turns out Mike was planning to
propose to me that same way last night.

206
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,097
Oh, my God.
Mike was gonna propose?

207
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,336
- That's huge.
- Do you want to marry him?

208
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,496
Yeah, I really do. Yes.

209
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,969
But after I dumped on the way
he was gonna do it...

210
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,497
...I don't think he'll ever ask again.
I said no in Barbados, and now this?

211
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,333
She's right. If I were a guy and...

212
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,898
Did I just say, "If I were a guy"?

213
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,930
You don't need him to propose to you.
Maybe you could propose to him.

214
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,610
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Isn't that a little desperate?

215
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,890
I proposed to Chandler.

216
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,377
All right, moving on.

217
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,975
I don't think it was desperate.
It was amazing.

218
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,129
Thank you.

219
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,259
- Well, do you think I should propose?
- I think it could be kind of great.

220
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,493
Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
There's nothing like it.

221
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,368
Okay. Okay.
So how should I do it?

222
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,730
How about at a game
on the big screen?

223
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,298
How about at a Foot Locker?

224
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,259
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.

225
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,856
- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
- Yeah, that does make sense.

226
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,535
- Okay, now, would you two like that?
- Sounds good to me.

227
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,850
But what would a guy think?

228
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,651
- Nana's on the phone.
- Wow.

229
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,336
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.

230
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,492
She did?

231
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,810
Who got her condo in Boca?

232
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,299
Hello?

233
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,091
It's our nanny.

234
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,619
Hi.

235
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,296
Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
Okay. Bye.

236
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,132
That's Molly. She's sick.

237
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,292
- Can you watch Emma today?
- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.

238
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,338
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.

239
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,258
Menstrual cramps.

240
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,375
I don't think that's what this is.

241
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,179
- Can any of you watch Emma?
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

242
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,099
No, I've got work,
and then I'm proposing.

243
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,689
Great. Shoot.
What am I gonna do?

244
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,652
Well, I could do it.

245
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,130
- Well, actually...
- Can I talk to you for a second?

246
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,573
I do not want her babysitting our child.

247
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,130
- Why not?
- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

248
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,491
- Ella's a nice name.
- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

249
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,691
- The next one?
- Okay.

250
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,489
I don't want her watching our baby.

251
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,732
Ross, I am trying to help her
become a better person.

252
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,731
This is a huge breakthrough for her.

253
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,973
She just offered to do something
for another human being.

254
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,249
You know, I don't know.

255
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,614
Ross, I'm telling you...

256
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,449
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
shaped to do this, all right?

257
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,169
Do you understand how important
that is in our world?

258
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,250
Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.

259
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,578
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.

260
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,857
And plus, Rachel's been
so wonderful to me.

261
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,860
- Absolutely.
- Oh, great!

262
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,170
So how much does it pay?

263
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,410
How's the second draft
of the letter coming?

264
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,777
Great. I'm finished. In fact,
I just dropped it off at the agency.

265
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,173
- You dropped it off?
- Yeah.

266
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,808
Can we read it?
Can you print out another copy?

267
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,658
No can do, <i>amigo.</i>

268
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,895
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.

269
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,691
- You handwrote it?
- Yeah, and don't worry.

270
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,249
I didn't try to sound smart at all.

271
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,574
See you later.

272
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,289
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That letter is gonna go in our file.

273
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,212
We're never gonna get a kid.

274
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,490
We're gonna be
one of those old couples...

275
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,891
...that collects orchids
or has a lot of birds.

276
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,692
It's okay. You know what?

277
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,136
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.

278
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,779
Okay, good.

279
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,019
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.

280
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,298
Someone just dropped off a handwritten
recommendation letter and...

281
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,329
Okay.

282
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,100
Thank you. Goodbye.

283
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,052
We're screwed, aren't we?

284
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,814
You know what? Just tell me
on the way to the bird store.

285
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,694
- They loved it.
- What?

286
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,773
They thought it was very smart of us
to have a child write the letter.

287
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,771
They thought Joey was a child?

288
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,858
She guessed 8, 9,
based on his drawings.

289
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,295
- Hi.
- Hey, what'd you guys do today?

290
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,409
Ella wanted to go out, so we went
shopping and got some sushi.

291
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,812
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, not really.

292
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,459
Babies are dull.

293
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,854
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
- I'm fine.

294
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,329
And I got you a present
for letting me stay with you.

295
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,458
- Ready?
- Yeah.

296
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,177
You pierced her ears?

297
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,099
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

298
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,209
You pierced her ears?

299
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,695
How could you do this
without telling me?

300
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,415
If I had told you, then it wouldn't
have been a surprise, now would it?

301
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,259
I think she looks cute.

302
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,096
But I am wrong.

303
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,098
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

304
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,735
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?

305
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,692
- Hey, guys.
- Ross!

306
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,614
Hi, Emma.
Why is she wearing her hat so low?

307
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,291
- She can barely see.
- I don't really want her to see.

308
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,449
Why not?

309
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,180
Because there are so many
terrible sights in this world.

310
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,571
Like war. Or that thing
in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?

311
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,692
It was in a milk carton,
but it looked like meat?

312
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,371
Come here. Come here.

313
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,777
There she is. Hi.

314
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,297
- What?
- Nothing.

315
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,938
Hi.

316
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,894
What...?

317
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,289
- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
- Oh, they're real.

318
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,890
Did she do this to her?

319
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,415
I told you we shouldn't have
left Emma with her!

320
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,457
I know, I know.
And you were right, Ross.

321
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,096
Okay? You are so irresponsible!
I am never letting you babysit again!

322
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,052
You know what?
This kid needs me, okay?

323
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,049
- She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
- I'm a cool, fun aunt.

324
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,898
Okay.

325
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,698
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
at organized indoor projects.

326
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,734
All I wanted to do was help you try
to figure out what to do with your life.

327
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,134
This is how you repay me?

328
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,895
I don't need you to help me. I already
know what I'm gonna do with my life.

329
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,649
- Oh, yeah? Since when?
- Since today.

330
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,571
I am going to be a baby stylist.

331
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,737
- What?
- That's not a thing!

332
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,258
Well, it should be.

333
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,093
I'm gonna help babies learn
how to accessorize...

334
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,491
...what colors to wear,
what clothes are slimming.

335
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,659
- Babies don't care if they're slim!
- Enter Amy.

336
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,769
- Amy, l... I just... I just wanna...
- What? What are you gonna do?

337
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,292
No more falafel for you!

338
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,891
Great game, huh?

339
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,573
- Why do you keep looking at the screen?
- I'm not. I'm praying.

340
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,856
Please let the Knicks win.

341
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,090
Thank you, Thor.

342
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,654
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

343
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,936
- Well, I think you should wait.
- Why?

344
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,292
Well, if you don't hold it in,
you don't get all the nutrients.

345
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,449
<i>Knicks fans, please turn your attention</i>
<i>to the big screen on the scoreboard.</i>

346
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,493
<i>Someone has a special question to ask.</i>

347
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,653
Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?

348
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,695
<i>Get a load of this.</i>
<i>She's proposing to him!</i>

349
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,330
<i>Guess we know who wears</i>
<i>the pants in that family.</i>

350
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,014
Well, that's not very enlightened.

351
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,898
Boo us? Boo you!

352
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,255
Hello?
Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.

353
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,251
Oh, hi.

354
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,255
Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.

355
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,090
No, my mommy and daddy
aren't home right now.

356
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,490
Okay, bye-bye.

357
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,251
She was nice.

358
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,689
Joey, get Amy's bags.
She is moving out.

359
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,739
- You're kicking me out?
- You put holes in my baby's ears.

360
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,010
At least now people
will know she's a girl!

361
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,934
I can't believe I ever
even tried to help you.

362
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,568
- You are so beyond help!
- You know what?

363
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,613
Ever since I got here,
you have been nothing but negative.

364
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,378
- Excuse me?
- You didn't want me...

365
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,815
...to marry the old guy
with the great apartment.

366
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,576
Then I tried to help your daughter
de-emphasize her flaws...

367
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,731
...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?

368
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,649
- Joey, where are those bags?
- She has a lot of crap!

369
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,577
You know? When I moved in here,
I thought, "This will be so great.

370
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,698
Just us sisters back together again
like when we were kids."

371
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,930
Except without that stupid Jill.

372
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,130
Who has gotten fat, by the way.

373
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,168
Seriously?

374
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,816
Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.

375
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,693
- Hips or thighs?
- Ass and face.

376
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,733
Oh, my God!
I thought she was on Atkins.

377
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,817
She was. Carbs found her.

378
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,574
See? This is what I wanted.

379
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,176
Two sisters talking about real stuff.

380
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,571
Oh, I can give you that.

381
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,011
- You can?
- Yeah.

382
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,973
I kept trying to make you
a better person, but you're...

383
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,371
You're already a pretty perfect
version of what you are.

384
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,217
Thank you.

385
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,940
You gotta admit,
Emma does look cute.

386
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,856
- Did you just say, "Emma"?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.

387
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,893
That woman didn't know what
she was talking about, Mike.

388
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,290
Obviously, you have balls.

389
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,333
- Please, let's forget the whole thing.
- I would love it.

390
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,331
- Consider it forgotten.
- Thank you.

391
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,732
But just so you know...

392
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,293
However and whenever you decide
to propose, I promise I'll say yes.

393
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,856
Whether, you know,
it's at a basketball game...

394
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,851
...or in skywriting...

395
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,614
...or, you know, like some lame
guy in a cheesy movie...

396
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,736
...who hides it in the cake.

397
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,614
It's in the cake, isn't it?

398
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,016
Where else would lame
Mr. No Balls hide it?

399
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,899
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?

400
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,369
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

401
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,969
I keep trying to propose
in these stupid ways...

402
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,179
...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
and I wanna spend my life with you...

403
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,490
- I'm gonna do this now.
- Oh, my God.

404
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,891
- Phoebe, l...
- Wait. Oh, wait.

405
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,300
Ready? Okay.

406
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,374
Phoebe, I love you.

407
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,337
There's no one else in the world I would
ask to marry me three times.

408
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,929
But I want to take care of you...

409
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,453
...have babies with you...

410
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,896
...and grow old with you.

411
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,858
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

412
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,492
Yes.

413
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,129
- I love you.
- I love you more.

414
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,455
Not possible.

415
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,094
She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls!

416
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,532
So how's the baby-styling
business going?

417
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,736
Not that great.

418
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,609
It's almost as if people don't want
to hear that their babies are ugly.

419
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,134
That's shocking.

420
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,933
There's Ross. Hey, Ross.

421
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,889
Hello, Ross?

422
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,053
He's rude.

423
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,249

1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,661
- Hey.
- Hi.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,303
Pheebs, what's wrong?

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,780
I'm just so exhausted from dragging
around this huge engagement ring.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,629
- Oh, my God.
- Congratulations.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,628
So did he get on one knee?
Did he have a speech prepared?

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,542
Oh, did he cry?

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,662
Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,463
Well, it was really sweet,
and, like, the most romantic thing ever.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,747
Here's to Phoebe, who's found
the greatest guy in the world.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,019
To Phoebe and...

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,340
I want to say "Mike"?

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,179
- To Phoebe and Mike.
- Hey.

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,950
Thank you. Oh, and I have
something for you.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,580
It's my little black book. It's got
the numbers of all the guys I've dated.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,624
Oh, Phoebe, that's nice,
but you know what? I think I'm okay.

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,179
Give it to one
of your other single girlfriends.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,540
I would, but you're the last one.

18
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,068
Give me the book!

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,027
"Pablo Diaz.

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,942
Brady Smith.

21
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,428
Guy in Van"?

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,342
Oh, my first love.

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,827
What is the red X next
to Bob Gremore's name mean?

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,861
Dead.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,346
Oh, it's okay. No, he was old. Yeah.

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,509
And he lived a full life. He was
in the first wave at Omaha Beach.

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,869
I should've given you guys
my black book when I got married.

28
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,624
Although, it wasn't so much
a book as a napkin.

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,140
With Janice's phone number on it.

30
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,829
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?

31
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,389
Oh, yes, they are.

32
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,460
The One With Ross' Grant

33
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,263
Hey, honey.

34
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,509
Hey, sweetie.

35
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,702
- Is Monica not here?
- No.

36
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,385
Then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding
for a big account, and they got it.

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,984
- It's my first national commercial.
- Cool.

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,023
And I don't want to brag,
but a lot of the ideas were mine.

39
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,307
Hell, you weren't there.
All the ideas were mine.

40
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,667
That's great.
Hey, can you cast me in it?

41
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,739
I really don't think
you're right for the part.

42
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:49,505
What do you mean?
I can do anything. I'm a chameleon.

43
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,661
I'm old.

44
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,868
I'm tired.

45
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,660
Oh, I am hot. I'm cold.
Come on, what can't I do?

46
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,985
First of all, bravo.

47
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,664
But I don't think you're right for this.
The part's a stuffy college professor.

48
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,584
I can do that.
Hello, I'm your professor.

49
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,187
When I'm not busy thinking
of important things, or professing...

50
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,347
...I like to use...
What's the product?

51
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,020
Software that facilitates
inter-business networking e-solutions.

52
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,098
I'm cold.

53
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,669
- Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,225
Guess who's a finalist
for a huge research grant?

55
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,990
I'll give you a hint.
He's looking right at you.

56
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,667
Well, unless it's the creepy guy
with his hand up his kilt...

57
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,264
...I'm gonna say, "Congratulations."

58
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,782
I'm so excited. Apparently, I beat out
hundreds of other applicants...

59
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,418
...including five guys
I went to graduate school with.

60
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,502
Not that I'm keeping score,
or anything. Five.

61
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,709
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,260
- So tell me about the grant.
- Well, okay, it's for $25,000.

63
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,462
And if I get it, I'll be able
to complete my field research.

64
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,299
And there will be an article about me
in the <i>Paleontology Review</i>.

65
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,700
It'll be the first time
my name is in there...

66
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,589
...without people raising
serious questions about my work.

67
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,627
- Are you talking about the Dewer Grant?
- Yeah. Why?

68
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,866
Benjamin Hobart
is administering that grant.

69
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,026
- Your ex-boyfriend?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,547
So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine
if your new boyfriend gets this grant?

71
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,383
Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.

72
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,780
No. No, we ended on great terms.

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,669
If anything, I think this could
help you. You know what?

74
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,822
Why don't we all go out to dinner,
and I can introduce you.

75
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,629
- lf you think it'd help.
- Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him.

76
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,350
Now, is there anything I could
do to butter him up?

77
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,068
Anything he really likes?

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,540
He does have
a pretty serious latex fetish.

79
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,218
We'll see how dinner goes.

80
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,503
- Hey.
- Hey, you want to go see a movie?

81
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,106
I told you I had to spend all day
clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.

82
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,862
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

83
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,228
Now that I'm here, I might as well help
with the cleaning and organizing.

84
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,426
I just happen to have my label maker.

85
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,459
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.

86
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,787
Did you and Chandler make compromises
when you moved in together?

87
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,543
Chandler did.

88
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,944
- What does he want you to give up?
- A bunch of stuff.

89
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,102
And the worst one,
he wants me to get rid of Gladys.

90
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,626
Who's Gladys?

91
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,029
Oh, what a tragic loss.

92
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,868
Yeah, I really hate to give her up.
Oh, I know. Oh, you should take her.

93
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,502
Oh, I don't know.

94
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,103
- What, you don't like her?
- Of course I do. What's not to like?

95
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,099
I'd take her in a minute.

96
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,261
But I think that you're
giving up too easy.

97
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,944
I think that you need
to fight for her.

98
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,826
- Really, you think?
- Absolutely.

99
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,749
You say to him, "I'm sorry, Mike,
I can't live without her.

100
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,105
She means too much to me."

101
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,706
Okay, I'll fight for her. Okay.

102
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,180
Oh, wait. I just realized, if I do that,
that means you don't get her.

103
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,267
Damn it, I did not think this through.

104
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,708
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

105
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,588
Oh, any word on casting yet?

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,787
- I told you, you're not right for the part.
- What do you mean?

107
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,949
Rach, don't I seem like a professor
you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?

108
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,426
I'm sorry, this sounds like something
I'm never gonna be interested in.

109
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,308
Look, come on, please? It's not like
I'm asking you for some crazy favor.

110
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,223
This is what I do for a living.
I am a professional actor.

111
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,301
Man, I'm two hours late for work.

112
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,182
Here's my reel. It's got all
the commercials that I've been in.

113
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,948
- Joe...
- Just watch it.

114
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,783
If you don't like it,
don't pass it on to your bosses.

115
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,788
- Fine.
- Thank you.

116
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,184
- Work, Joe.
- Damn it.

117
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,739
- What am I gonna do now?
- Just pass the tape along.

118
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,582
He's not right for the part.

119
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,179
If I suggest him,
my bosses will think I'm an idiot.

120
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,864
And that's something
they should learn on their own.

121
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,986
Just tell Joey
that you watched the tape...

122
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,141
...and you liked it,
but your bosses didn't.

123
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,744
Then you're the good guy,
and they're the bad guy.

124
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,101
That's good. I liked it, they didn't.

125
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,978
Joey, for God's sake, go to work.

126
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,909
I can't believe I'm about
to meet Benjamin Hobart.

127
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,465
I've always thought of him
as someone I'd invite...

128
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,019
...to my fantasy dinner party.

129
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,346
Do you think there's any chance
he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO?

130
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,504
Sorry, it looks like it's just him.

131
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,589
Charlie.

132
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,459
My God, you look absolutely stunning.

133
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,588
Well, I am having a good hair day.

134
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,979
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, you too.

135
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,784
I'm okay.

136
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,787
I'm sorry. Ross Geller,
Benjamin Hobart.

137
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,908
It's an honor to meet you.
I can't tell you how long...

138
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,860
...I've been an admirer of your work.
I mean, that Nobel Prize.

139
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,463
I mean, I have to tell you that you're
one of the reasons I got into the field.

140
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,428
Well, likewise.

141
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,468
Not likewise. I'd never heard
of you until this morning.

142
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,143
But it's nice to be nice.

143
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,620
- Shall we?
- Yeah. Thank you.

144
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,426
I can't believe that you chose
this restaurant.

145
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,469
- Do you remember the night?
- Oh, my God. I completely forgot.

146
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,744
Oh, my God, I can't believe
they let us back in this place.

147
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,700
You weren't there.

148
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,308
No, but, you know,
it's just a funny image.

149
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,783
You know, the two of you
in this restaurant with the...

150
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,305
Why don't you tell Benji about your
proposal while I go to the ladies' room.

151
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,622
So tell me about it.

152
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,068
Okay. Well, I would like to do a dig
in the Painted Desert.

153
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,228
There are still several areas
that haven't been fully excavated.

154
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,743
- Break up with Charlie.
- What?

155
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,224
What?

156
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,229
Did you just say,
"Break up with Charlie"?

157
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,509
Well, yes and no. Yes, I did say it.
And no, I didn't not say it.

158
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,184
- Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
- Listen, I'm sorry.

159
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,780
I just haven't seen her for so long,
all these feelings are rushing back.

160
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,220
I'm starting to realize
how much I've missed her.

161
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,665
And I'm gonna need you
to break up with her.

162
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,258
- Are you serious?
- lf you say, yes, then I'm serious.

163
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,660
If you say, no, then I'm joking.

164
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,742
- No.
- Joking it is.

165
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,463
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Hey, how'd it go with Mike?

166
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,464
- Is he gonna let you keep the painting?
- No, he really hates it.

167
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,349
But he's gonna let me keep
my box of human hair.

168
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,704
So you gotta pick your battles.
But the good news is, Gladys is yours.

169
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,819
Wow, what's the bad news?

170
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,302
- Who's Gladys?
- Oh, she's that work of art I made.

171
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,104
You know, with the woman
coming out of the frame.

172
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,585
And Monica gets to keep her?

173
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,742
In her house? I am so jealous.

174
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,581
I didn't know you wanted her too.

175
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,986
Well, I mean, sure, of course.

176
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,461
But you already gave that
to Monica, so...

177
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,299
- You know, I would give her up for you.
- No, I couldn't let you do that.

178
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,666
- No, but I want to.
- But I don't want you to.

179
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,624
- But I insist.
- But I insist harder.

180
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,540
Girls. Girls. Stop.
Okay, we'll flip a coin.

181
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,861
Heads, she's Rachel's.
Tails, she's Monica's.

182
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,819
- Tails. Monica, she's yours.
- No, that landed in your food.

183
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,749
No, no, that's okay.
You won fair and square. I'm so sad.

184
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,508
- Hey, Joe?
- What's up?

185
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,582
Bad news. I watched the tape
and passed it along to my bosses...

186
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,105
...and they weren't interested.

187
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,790
I'm sorry, man.

188
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,863
- But you watched the tape?
- Yeah, I liked it.

189
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:55,588
But my bosses didn't go for it.
Stupid sons of bitches.

190
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:04,107
- You didn't watch the tape.
- What? Of course I did.

191
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,983
Look, it's one thing not to cast me,
but to lie to me?

192
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,102
- I'm not lying to you. I watched it.
- You lied again.

193
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,307
- I watched it.
- Keep going, Pinocchio.

194
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,268
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

195
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,466
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.

196
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,904
- Did you watch the tape?
- No.

197
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,586
The selection committee has chosen
the three of you as our finalists.

198
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,305
The decision will be based on the
answers you give to the questions I ask.

199
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,940
We'll start with Dr. Li.
You claim the field is too reliant...

200
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,308
...on the Linnaean taxonomic system.
How do you propose to correct this?

201
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,542
I believe that the answers lie
in the osteological evidence.

202
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,462
- I plan to begin there.
- Interesting.

203
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,582
I guess.

204
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,219
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some
fieldwork. Where might that take place?

205
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,950
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region
of South Dakota.

206
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,388
Certainly. Very well.
And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?

207
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,262
What? l...

208
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,260
Care to venture a guess?

209
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,549
- May 12?
- That's not even kind of close.

210
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,780
Dr. Li, how many graduate students
will you need?

211
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,867
- Half a dozen.
- I see. And Dr. Biely?

212
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,260
Three for excavation,
and two for analysis.

213
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,105
Certainly. Dr. Geller,
which 1965 Shirelles hit...

214
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,342
...was later covered by
a popular British Invasion band?

215
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,259
What? I need six graduate students.

216
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,145
No, I'm sorry.
We were looking for "Baby It's You."

217
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,538
"Baby It's You."

218
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,306
What? Wait just a minute.

219
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,542
None of my questions have anything
to do with paleontology.

220
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,099
You're right, I apologize.
Scratch the last question.

221
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,340
Spell "Boscodictiasaur."

222
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,787
I've never heard
of a "Boscodictiasaur."

223
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,180
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.

224
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,186
- Okay. B-O...
- No, it starts with a silent M.

225
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,460
Oh, come on!

226
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,425
I can't believe Joey.
I hate being called a liar.

227
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,949
But you are a liar.

228
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,107
What did I just say?

229
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,704
- Are you still here?
- Yes.

230
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,148
And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted.
When I tell somebody I did something...

231
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,303
Okay, hold on, let me just stop you
right there, okay? First, you lied. Right?

232
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,938
Then you lied about lying, okay?

233
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,829
Then you lied about lying
about lying, okay?

234
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,223
So before you lie about lying
about lying about lying about lying...

235
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,907
Stop lying.

236
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,624
Why are you so sure
I didn't watch this tape?

237
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,781
You wanna know why?
You wanna know why?

238
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,141
Well, this is going well.

239
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,102
Here's how I know.

240
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,940
If you had seen what was on this tape,
believe me, you'd have some comments.

241
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,783
All right, remember,
I got paid a lot of money for this...

242
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,106
...and it only aired in Japan.

243
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,508
<i>Ichiban.</i>

244
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,026
<i>Ichiban, lipstick for men.</i>

245
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,142
<i>Ichiban, lipstick for men.</i>

246
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,019
And that's how I know
you didn't watch the tape.

247
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,225
He really is a chameleon.

248
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,949
Well, Gladys, say hello
to your new home.

249
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,550
- Oh, my.
- Wow.

250
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,782
Oh, she is so nice and big.

251
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,506
Oh, Monica, where are you going
to display Gladys, oh, so proudly?

252
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,583
- I haven't really settled on a spot yet.
- How about right above the TV?

253
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,028
That way, it will be the first thing
that you see when you walk in the door.

254
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,506
Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid
of that French poster.

255
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,541
- I like that poster.
- Really?

256
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,060
It doesn't have anything
coming out of it.

257
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,424
Or maybe there's someplace
for her in your bedroom?

258
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,225
- There's nothing above your bed.
- Are you still here?

259
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,341
Oh, hi. Hello.

260
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,583
Have you come to ask me some more
paleontology-related questions?

261
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,709
Your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?
Ann-Margaret's pant size?

262
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,228
I've come here to apologize.
I think I may have let my feelings...

263
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,143
...for Charlie interfere
with the interview process.

264
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,341
No. Stop!

265
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,828
Anyway, I decided
to offer you the grant.

266
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,782
- Really?
- There is just one small stipulation.

267
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,939
- I have to break up with Charlie?
- Hey, you got one right.

268
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,622
- You're crazy.
- Crazy or romantic?

269
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,384
Crazy.

270
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,382
- Or?
- Get out!

271
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,139
Oh, my God.

272
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,268
- What?
- Joey, what is this thing doing here?

273
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,106
I got her from Monica. She sold it
to me for a very reasonable price.

274
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,746
- Joey, we're not keeping this.
- But it's an original Buffay.

275
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,429
All right, fine. You can keep it.

276
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,820
As long as you don't mind
that she's haunted.

277
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,463
Hey, what? What?

278
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,182
Well, legend has it, Joey, that she
comes alive when you're asleep.

279
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,308
She climbs out of the frame...

280
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,583
...and then drags her half-a-body
across the floor...

281
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,502
...just looking for legs to steal.

282
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,145
And then with her one good hand...

283
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,144
...she slowly reaches up...

284
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,426
...and turns your doorknob.

285
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,225
Get that legless witch out of here!

286
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,348
- Hey, I sold that to Joey.
- Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.

287
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,343
- Two can play at this game.
- Too late. You can't give it back.

288
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,626
- Oh, yes, I can.
- No, you can't, she's yours.

289
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,104
- She's yours.
- She's yours.

290
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,579
- She's yours.
- Hey.

291
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,509
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

292
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,501
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

293
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,782
You guys, you don't have
to fight over her anymore.

294
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,227
Whoever doesn't get Gladys,
gets Glynnis.

295
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,180
- I want Gladys.
- She's mine.

296
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,261
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

297
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,268
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't give them your tape.

298
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,309
And I promise next time to submit you,
whether I think you're right or not.

299
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,308
That's not the point, Chandler.
The point is that you lied.

300
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,907
I know. You're right. What's it
gonna take for you to forgive me?

301
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,145
Oh, my God.

302
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,186
Excellent.

303
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,419
Now what do you say?

304
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,706
Lying is wrong.

305
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,225
And? And?!

306
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,623
I'm a pretty little girl.

307
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,583
I knew it.

308
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,107
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.

309
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,184
- Did you get the grant?
- No. And you wanna know why?

310
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,547
Because your ex-boyfriend
is still in love with you.

311
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,699
What?

312
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,065
He refused me
because I wouldn't give you up.

313
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,421
Benji isn't in love with me.
I mean, he broke up with me.

314
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,663
- And besides, he's a very ethical man.
- Really?

315
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,984
Is it ethical to ask someone
in a grant review:

316
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,981
"Who was the voice of Underdog?"

317
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,223
I'm sure he was just joking.

318
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,540
If you don't believe me,
let's go talk to him.

319
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,662
I'm telling you, he didn't ask me
one paleontological question.

320
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,703
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:

321
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,020
"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"

322
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,586
Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco
in Congo, then M-B-O...

323
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,859
Damn it.

324
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,462
Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are
you doing here?

325
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,422
I want you to tell her everything.

326
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,139
About the deal you tried to make
with me, about the crazy questions you...

327
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,385
Wally Cox.
That's the voice of Underdog.

328
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,141
Like I tried to tell you
in the interview...

329
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,098
...this grant is not based on your
knowledge of pretty useless trivia.

330
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,060
No, don't do that. I want you to look
her in the eyes and tell her the truth.

331
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,299
Benji?

332
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,981
It's true. I behaved horribly,
but it's only because I still love you.

333
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,028
And I would do anything
to have you back in my life.

334
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,744
Too little, too late, Benji.

335
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,749
- I can't believe this.
- I never should've broken up with you.

336
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,745
I think about you all the time.
Do you ever still think about me?

337
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,349
No.

338
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,385
- Yes.
- What?

339
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,978
I don't know what to say, Benji.
This is all so...

340
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,141
...romantic.

341
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,109
Or?

342
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,786
I know I may be
way out of bounds here...

343
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,300
...but is there any chance
you would take me back?

344
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,786
Maybe.

345
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,704
Sweetie, this conversation is starting
to make me a little uncomfortable.

346
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,905
Oh, God. I am so sorry, but...

347
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,666
I mean, there's so much history
between us, you know?

348
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,185
I'm sorry too.

349
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,499
- I love you.
- I love you too.

350
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,302
Okay, that's it,
we are seeing other people.

351
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,459
Gladys?

352
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,819
For the third time this week.
Man, this does not get old.

353
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,898
- You're mean!
- Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.

1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,634
Hey, you guys.
Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,190
- Figuring out our wedding plans.
- Funny. We were doing the same thing.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,475
It's really crazy.
The hall, the dress, the food.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,315
- I had no idea how expensive this was.
- Yeah, it is really pricey.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,870
- I freaked when I heard the numbers.
- So, what did you two do about it?

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,838
It was simple. I came up with
some cost-cutting solutions...

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,709
...wrote out a list
and Monica told me to go to hell.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,359
There's no way around it. Just accept
that this is gonna cost a lot of money.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,830
I heard that weddings are, like,
a $40 billion-a-year industry.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,993
Yeah. And I'm responsible
for just, like, half of that.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,750
But really, it does seem like
this money could be put to better use.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,989
Are you serious?

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,516
Yeah. How would you feel if we gave
all the wedding money to charity...

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,716
...and we just got married
at City Hall?

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,031
I think it would make me
wanna marry you even more.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,875
I gotta say, you guys,
that's an incredible gesture.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,679
Maybe you do that
next time you get married.

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,039
No, no, no. The next time's
gonna be Hawaii at sunset.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,839
But maybe the time after that.

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,550
The One With the Home Study

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,828
- Hey. What's going on?
- Hey.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,470
Our adoption social worker is coming,
so we're cleaning the apartment.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,278
"We"?

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,635
You know you don't want me to help.
You can't have it both ways.

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,758
Is this the person who decides
whether or not you get a baby?

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,151
- She's coming to see where we live.
- And it has to go perfectly.

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,199
If she doesn't like us, she can keep
us off every adoption list in the state.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,756
Hey, maybe I should stop by.
She could be a soap opera fan.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,959
It's very impressive when
the little people know a celebrity.

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,479
"Little people"?

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,392
"Celebrity."

32
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,392
So I think I'm just about done here.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,156
Unless you have any bad stuff hidden
somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,992
What?

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,679
- No.
- Chandler.

36
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,749
I don't, and I'm offended
by the insinuation.

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,434
So there's not a magazine
under the couch...

38
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,478
...or cigarettes taped to the back
of the toilet tank...

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,074
...or a filthy video in the VCR?

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,516
I'll admit the cigarettes and magazine.
But that tape is not mine.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,593
- It isn't mine.
- I guess we'll never know whose it is.

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,308
May I help you?

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,631
We're here to make a rather
sizable donation to the children.

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,314
Any contribution, large or small,
is appreciated.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,438
I think you're gonna appreciate
the crap out of this one.

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,910
- Well, this is very generous.
- And we don't want any recognition.

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,718
This is completely anonymous.

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,348
Completely anonymous.
From two kind strangers.

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,875
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.

50
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,357
We can put your names
in our newsletter.

51
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,273
- Not necessary.
- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.

52
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,553
And X is spelled "Mike Hannigan."

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,033
Well, on behalf of the children,
thank you both very much.

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,318
- I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.
- It does. It feels really good.

55
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,948
Oh, look. And we get
these free T-shirts.

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,237
Actually, that's the shirt
I wore to the gym.

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,113
It's moist.

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,720
- Hi. Emma will be up in a minute.
- Oh, good.

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,112
Hey, Ross, listen. I heard about
you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,319
That's okay. I'm sure there are tons of
other beautiful paleontologists out there.

61
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,123
- Absolutely.
- There was one. She's it.

62
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,362
All the rest look like
they should live under a bridge.

63
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,329
So, what are you gonna do today?

64
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,879
I was thinking of taking Emma
to the playground.

65
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,445
Oh, my God. What?

66
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,366
Like I said, I was thinking of taking
Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,402
Okay, look, Ross. I do not want
Emma going to the playground.

68
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,519
Because...?

69
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,285
All right, if you must know,
I had a traumatic...

70
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,920
...swing incident when I was little.

71
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,647
- Seriously?
- Yes. I was 4 years old.

72
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,562
And I was on the swing...

73
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,405
...and then all of a sudden my hair
got tangled in the chain.

74
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,886
And to get me out, my mom had
to cut a big chunk of my hair.

75
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,088
And it was uneven for weeks.

76
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,642
And you made it through that?

77
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,760
I wonder who's gonna play you
in the movie.

78
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,359
Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
I do not want Emma going there.

79
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,044
And I was thinking Claire Danes.

80
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,399
Look, I'm sorry to hear
about your tragedy.

81
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,165
But the swings are perfectly safe.
And besides, Emma loves them.

82
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,120
- You should come, and you'll see.
- Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.

83
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,520
And there's that moment
when you're at the top...

84
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,365
...when you just don't know
if you're gonna return back to Earth.

85
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,723
Space is filled with orbiting children.

86
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,681
Look, please, just come on.

87
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,399
When you see the look on Emma's face,
I swear, you won't regret it.

88
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,363
- All right.
- Good.

89
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,160
You don't wanna be a mom who passes
her irrational fears to her children.

90
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,683
"Irrational," huh?

91
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,479
I'll remember that next time you freak
out about a spider in your apartment.

92
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,689
That's the same. I'm sure there are 30
different species of poisonous swings.

93
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,846
Oh, my God.
The adoption lady is early.

94
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,207
Okay. Okay. Here we go.
Here we go.

95
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,564
Stand up straight.

96
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,527
Big smile.

97
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,689
Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?

98
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,126
We're waiting for the adoption lady.
But I'm glad you're here.

99
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,758
I was cleaning this morning
and I found this.

100
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,808
I don't know
if you wanna use it, but...

101
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,962
Oh, this is so sweet of you.

102
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,759
But I won't be needing a veil.
I actually won't be wearing a dress at all.

103
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,728
I told you, I am not coming
to a naked wedding!

104
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,085
No. We're not having a big reception.

105
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,004
We took the wedding money
and donated it to a children's charity.

106
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,728
That's crazy!

107
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,809
I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
my one wedding day like that.

108
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,167
Well, we're different.
I don't care about having a huge party.

109
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,480
This is really nice for you, but...

110
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,120
Oh, please. I put this on
and I just look like...

111
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,360
Well, radiant.

112
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,078
All right, but who cares? I don't need
a pretty veil and a fancy dress.

113
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,320
That's right.
You're making a commitment.

114
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,641
You know, that's the same
whether you do it at the Plaza or...

115
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,687
- Where you gonna do it?
- City Hall.

116
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,248
Oh, that sounds nice.

117
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,483
I was just there for jury duty.
They've really spruced that place up.

118
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,081
Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
I've made my decision.

119
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,889
What I really want
is a great big wedding.

120
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,408
- But you gave all the money to charity.
- Well, I'll just ask for it back.

121
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,919
- I don't think you can do that.
- Why not?

122
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,163
This is her wedding day. That's way
more important than some stupid kids.

123
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,646
That's sweet, honey, but save
something for the adoption lady.

124
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,689
- All right, okay. Be careful.
- Okay.

125
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,081
Careful. Watch her hair.
Watch her hair!

126
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,801
- Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
- I know. I know.

127
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,919
But they're just so beautiful.
Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.

128
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,480
I promise you she's safe.
Watch how much she loves this.

129
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,165
- Okay. Okay.
- Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.

130
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,281
Okay, careful. Okay.

131
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,922
She's smiling.

132
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,445
Look at that, she does like it.

133
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,929
See, I told you.

134
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,759
Oh, my God. Look at her,
she's a little daredevil.

135
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,009
- Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?
- Oh, absolutely.

136
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,526
Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
It's in the diaper bag.

137
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,043
Okay.

138
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,680
See? Scared of the swings.
I bet you feel pretty silly.

139
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,645
- We're asking for the money back?
- It's for our wedding day.

140
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,803
Now, is this guy gay or straight?
Because one of us has to start flirting.

141
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,169
You here to make another
donation the same day?

142
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,366
I don't think that's ever
happened before.

143
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,122
Gay. Go.

144
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,729
Oh, my God, I love your shirt.

145
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,487
The donation we made earlier?
Well, we want it back.

146
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,759
Excuse me?

147
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,240
Okay, that money was for a big wedding
we thought we didn't want.

148
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,684
But it turns out we do.

149
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,286
So you're asking us to refund
your donation to the children?

150
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,129
Yeah.

151
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,600
This feels really good.

152
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,478
I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding's
just really important to me.

153
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,165
Hey, it's none of my business.
Besides, this is probably a good thing.

154
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,767
We've really been spoiling the children,
what with all the food and warm clothing.

155
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,328
That's not fair.
A person's wedding is important.

156
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,048
And especially to me.

157
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,839
I didn't have a graduation party.
And I didn't go to prom.

158
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,605
And I spent my sweet 16
being chased around a tire yard...

159
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,285
...by an escaped mental patient who,
in his own words, wanted to:

160
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,042
"Kill me, or whatever."

161
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,403
So I deserve a real celebration.

162
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,768
And I'm not gonna let some sweaty
little man make me feel badly about it.

163
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,247
She could've been talking about
either one of us.

164
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,408
Hi, I'm Laura.
I'm here for your adoption interview.

165
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,038
Hi, I'm Monica.
And this is Chandler.

166
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,326
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

167
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,402
- Would you like something to drink?
- Water would be fine.

168
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,640
We're so glad that you're here.

169
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,324
We're excited about
getting this process started.

170
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,368
Because we love kids.
Love them to death.

171
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,806
Well, not actually to death.
That's just a figure of speech.

172
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,120
We love kids the appropriate amount...

173
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,885
...as allowed by law.

174
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,840
- Your place is just lovely.
- Thank you.

175
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,889
Yes, this building does have
a wholesome, family feel to it.

176
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,282
I feel like I've been here before. Any
other couples in the building adopting?

177
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,648
Is that that couple on the first floor?
We should get a baby before them.

178
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,607
That guy tried to sell me drugs.

179
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,640
But other than that,
wholesome, wholesome building.

180
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,166
- What?
- I realized why I remember this place.

181
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,400
- Really? What is it?
- Oh, it's nothing.

182
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,688
I went on a date with a guy who lived
in this building. It didn't end very well.

183
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,683
That wouldn't, by any chance,
be Joey Tribbiani?

184
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,688
- Yes!
- Of course it was.

185
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,642
We had a great night. In the morning,
he promised he'd call and he didn't.

186
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,243
Rat bastard!

187
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,724
- So you're not friends with him?
- Oh, God, no.

188
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,960
- No, no, no.
- No. Nope.

189
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,445
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.

190
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,647
So are either one of you planning
on staying at home?

191
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,406
Hello?
Anybody in there order a celebrity?

192
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,839
What was that?

193
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,480
That's just some crazy guy
who roams the halls here.

194
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,481
He's great with kids, though.

195
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,439
- Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Son of a bitch!

196
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,770
Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.

197
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,649
Ross, see, I told you!
Those swings are evil!

198
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,565
That's the last time Emma is getting on
one of those things for her entire life.

199
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,120
No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't
the swing's fault. It was my fault.

200
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,202
And kind of that kid's fault.

201
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,243
Who is still laughing. Nice.

202
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,886
Come on. Can we just get out of here
before somebody else gets hurt?

203
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,122
No. Wait. I have an idea.
I want you to get on the swing...

204
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,521
...and you'll see that there's
nothing to be afraid of.

205
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,530
I know what this is all about.

206
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,201
You've always been jealous of my hair.

207
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,563
I just think you're an adult, okay?
And you should get over your silly fears.

208
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,800
- All right, fine. I'll do it.
- Good.

209
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,928
- lf you hold a spider.
- Where?! Where?!

210
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,919
If you hold a spider.

211
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,682
I know.

212
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,004
Guys, is everything okay?
It's me, Joey.

213
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,448
Adoption!

214
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,369
What's going on?

215
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,004
Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...

216
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,480
...Bert, roaming the halls.

217
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,767
- Guys?
- Keep on roaming, Bert!

218
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,683
We don't want any crazy today!

219
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,919
- What's going on?
- We'll talk later! Everything's fine!

220
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,084
Everything doesn't sound fine.

221
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,485
Is he all right out there by himself?

222
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,767
Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
His older brother...

223
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,039
...Ernie.

224
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,000
- Bert and Ernie?
- You can't make this stuff up.

225
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,088
You never told me about that guy
and your sweet 16.

226
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,684
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, it ended okay.

227
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,000
One of my friends shot him.

228
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,039
At least you'll get a proper wedding.
You really deserve that.

229
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,089
Yeah, I really do.
You know, I had nothing growing up.

230
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,690
Just like the kids
I took the money from.

231
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,446
No. No, no. I see where this is going.
Don't make me go back there.

232
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,363
Look, I can't have a wedding
with this money now. It's tainted.

233
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,882
Fine, we'll give the money back.

234
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,405
If that guy at the charity
gives us a hard time...

235
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,721
...my friend hasn't shot anyone
in a really long time.

236
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,886
I must say this seems like a lovely
environment to raise a child in.

237
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,689
You are welcome to look
under any of the furniture...

238
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,320
...because, believe me, you won't find
any porn or cigarettes under there.

239
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,647
Before we look around, let me make sure
I have everything I need up to here.

240
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,650
Why don't I show you the baby's room.

241
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,286
- What are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me in.

242
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,680
- I thought you were in trouble.
- Well, we're not.

243
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,000
But you called me "Bert."

244
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,560
That's our code word for danger.

245
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,319
- We don't have a code word.
- We don't?

246
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,082
We really should.

247
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,243
From now on, "Bert"
will be our code word for danger.

248
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,844
So that was the baby's room.

249
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,682
- What room should we see next?
- Any room that isn't behind this couch.

250
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,165
Some people don't get him,
but I think he's really funny.

251
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,404
I did not care for that.

252
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,205
You have to leave.

253
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,089
You slept with our social worker
and never called her back.

254
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,241
She is still pissed,
so she can't see you.

255
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,162
Okay, okay.

256
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,643
- What?
- I forgot my bat.

257
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,167
Oh, my God.

258
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,323
And for the last time,
we do not want to be friends with you!

259
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,369
And we don't wanna buy your bat!

260
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,362
What are you doing here?

261
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,169
Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.

262
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,960
- Are you friends with him?
- I can explain.

263
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,163
Joey?

264
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,721
All right. Okay.

265
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,568
You have got some nerve
coming back here.

266
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,884
- I can't believe you never called me.
- Excuse me?

267
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,959
You probably don't even remember
my name. It's Joey, by the way.

268
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,328
And don't bother telling me yours,
because I totally remember it, lady.

269
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,761
I waited weeks for you to call me.

270
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,966
I gave you my number.
You never called me.

271
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,166
Don't try to turn this around on me.

272
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,164
I am not some kind of social work...

273
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,809
...that you can just...

274
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,369
...do.

275
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,488
- I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
- Really? Think about it. Come on.

276
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,006
You're a beautiful woman.
Smart, funny.

277
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,525
We had a really good time.

278
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,444
If I had your number,
why wouldn't I call you?

279
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,125
I don't know.

280
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,361
Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

281
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,160
Hey, too late for apologies. Okay?
You broke my heart.

282
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,720
You know how many women
I had to sleep with to get over you?

283
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,681
- Joey, wait...
- No!

284
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,728
I waited a long time!
I can't wait anymore.

285
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,843
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
I'm so embarrassed.

286
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,082
- Oh, that's really okay.
- Yeah. We totally understand.

287
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,799
- Dating is hard.
- Boy, you people are nice.

288
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,168
And I've got to say...

289
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,959
...I think you're going to make
excellent parents.

290
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,649
Laura!

291
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,208
We're back.

292
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,120
Are you here to take more money?

293
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,884
Because I think what you're
looking for is an ATM.

294
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,640
No, no, we're here
to give the money back.

295
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,519
Yeah. Because you know what?
It's all about the children.

296
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,244
Although it's also about the wedding.

297
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,165
All right, here. No. Oh, God.

298
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,005
If I haven't said so already,
sir, congratulations.

299
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,166
Okay, look, enough, all right?

300
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,207
I'm stepping in
and putting my foot down.

301
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,885
As your future husband,
I'm gonna make this decision for us.

302
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,205
What do you think we should do?

303
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,041
- It's not your decision anymore.
- What?

304
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,327
On behalf of the children of New York,
I reject your money.

305
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,928
- But we're giving you this.
- And I'm giving it back to you.

306
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,888
Come on. Consider it a contribution.

307
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,524
Well, this is very generous.

308
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,206
Take the check. Have a great wedding
and a wonderful life together.

309
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,282
Sounds good to me. We can save up,
come back in a few years...

310
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,168
...and make an even bigger donation.

311
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,082
And when you do, ask for Brian.

312
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,478
- Oh, is that you?
- No.

313
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,284
Hello?

314
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,928
Oh, hi.

315
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,604
Oh, my God, really?
I can't wait to tell Chandler.

316
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,408
Okay. Goodbye.

317
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,286
- Wrong number?
- That was Laura.

318
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,601
She gave us a great report and
we're officially on the waiting list.

319
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,079
- That's great.
- Now we just wait for a call...

320
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,606
...and someone tells us
there's a baby waiting for us.

321
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,769
Hello?

322
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,042
Have you seen Joey's bat?

323
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,005
Okay. I got a spider.

324
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,400
There were two,
I picked the bigger one.

325
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,159
- Okay.
- Okay.

326
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,521
This feels perfectly normal.

327
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,005
Okay, get on the swing.

328
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,329
Okay.

329
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,326
Okay.

330
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,243
Okay.

331
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,250
- See?
- All right. I can do this.

332
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,162
There you go. Good for you.

333
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,685
You know what?
I'm getting used to this little guy.

334
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,240
- I don't even feel him in here anymore.
- That's because he's on your neck.

We need to talk about something.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,197
Yeah. We don't feel like we can
host Thanksgiving this year.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,833
- What?
- Are you kidding?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,639
Well, it's just with work
and the stress of adoption...

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,631
...we don't feel like
we have the energy.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,112
Plus, we don't think it's fair
that every year the burden falls on us.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,477
That doesn't sound like you.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,551
That's Monica talking.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,197
- No, we made this decision together.
- She's putting words in your mouth.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,836
Don't you put words in people's mouths.
You put turkey in people's mouths.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,276
I can't believe this.
This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,473
- No, it's not.
- It's not? When was she born?

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,957
Well, personally, I think it's great
you're giving yourself a break.

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,674
- Thank you, Pheebs.
- Sure. It's just as well.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,509
I mean, last year wasn't very good.
I think she's losing her touch.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,759
- What? You are way off, lady.
- Am I? Really? Am I?

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,276
Well, why don't you cook
Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong.

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,835
Well, think about it. You'd be trying
to top what you did last year.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,072
You'd be in competition with yourself.

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,112
That's my favorite kind.

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,750
Okay, we are doing this.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,036
Don't let yourself
get manipulated this way.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,795
Stay out of this, Chandler.
This is between me and me.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,956
We are supposed to make
these decisions together.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,793
Did you not watch
the <i>Dr. Phil</i> I taped for you?

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,836
The One With The Late Thanksgiving

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,517
- Hey.
- Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

30
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,276
Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,551
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
from that bakery on Bleeker.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,518
- Could you pick them up for me?
- You're not making the pies?

33
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,039
I don't make chocolate pies.

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
When I was younger,
I entered this pie-eating contest.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,434
I ate so many that the
thought of them makes me sick.

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,232
Did you at least win the contest?

37
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,398
Two minutes, twelve pies
and a part of one tin.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,874
- Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
- Can't wait.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,875
This dinner is gonna be so great.
In your face, last-year me.

40
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,395
- Hey, Rach?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,993
What's Emma doing today?

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,709
Well, let's see, I know that she has
a meeting with her lawyer...

43
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,509
...and then she has to make
a very big poop.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,189
- Why?
- I want to enter her in a baby pageant.

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,029
Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing
I've ever heard.

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,431
Okay, but before you say no,
my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,034
And compared to Emma,
she's a real dog.

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,832
- Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
- Oh, okay.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,118
No. Phoebe, just the idea
of pitting one baby against another...

50
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,477
...I mean, you know, and judging
who's cuter just for a trophy...

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,389
- And a thousand dollars.
...is something I'm very interested in.

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,989
Oh, please, do not tell Ross.

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,794
He still believes that what's
on the inside is important.

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,748
Okay. And Emma needs
a cowgirl outfit for the competition.

55
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,554
Where am I gonna get
a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,749
Well, I was thinking...

57
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,032
Take the clothes
off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,478
Did someone drop the baton again?

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,956
Why come all the way
from Kansas to do that?

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,712
I don't get older, I just get better.

61
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,792
You know what just occurred to me?

62
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,474
This could be our last Thanksgiving
just the two of us.

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,835
I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.

64
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,395
- You don't know that.
- Somebody's gonna pick us.

65
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,034
But we haven't heard a thing
from the adoption agency.

66
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,191
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,478
Next year, it's gonna be
you, me and little Hemingway Bing.

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,952
- What? He's my favorite author.
- Name one of his books.

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,119
<i>The Firm</i>?

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,876
Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's
in the oven. The stuffing is ready.

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,999
You know, you always cook this meal
all by yourself. Let me help this year.

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,752
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,430
But you don't have to do everything
Dr. Phil tells you to do.

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,799
I'm serious, let me do something.
Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.

75
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,395
Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,478
It's easy to make,
and no one really cares about it.

77
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,673
Tell me more.

78
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,317
I'm gonna go check on something across
the hall. You start by washing these.

79
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,476
Not with soap!

80
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,598
You obviously haven't tasted
my Palmolive potatoes.

81
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,509
- Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
- Three tickets to today's Rangers game!

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,359
Dude, I wanted him to guess.

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,994
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, they're great seats too.

84
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,873
- Guess where they are.
- Center ice.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,831
Did I do something to you?

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,838
- The game's at 1.
- So?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,913
- Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
- So we'll leave before it's over.

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,588
But it could take us
a long time to get back home.

89
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,958
Plus, Joey could get lost and they could
have to page us to go pick him up.

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,269
Dude, two times that happened!

91
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,631
Look, Monica's
been working hard all day.

92
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,633
She didn't want to host
in the first place. We shouldn't go.

93
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,068
He's right, man.

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,152
- Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
- Okay.

95
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,113
And get ready to taste
my very special cranberries.

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,636
Or should I say "Chan-berries"?

97
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,958
That's some gentle comedy, dude.

98
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,798
- We're still going to the game, right?
- Yeah.

99
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,750
<i>This is contestant number 16,</i>
<i>Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.</i>

100
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,911
- Hey.
- Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.

101
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,479
This place is freaking me out.

102
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,474
I've been watching this guy over there.
I don't think he came with a kid.

103
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,829
But we can't leave now.

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,230
There was this one baby, Haley,
who was favored to win...

105
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,311
...she got croup,
so she had to stay home.

106
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,278
This competition
just blew wide-open, folks.

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,751
Phoebe, it's just too weird.

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,309
I just saw a 1 -year-old
with pantyhose on.

109
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,472
Oh, I know. We should've
been more prepared.

110
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,599
It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
our real competition now is Cameron.

111
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,591
My God, they just took her sweater off.

112
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,990
Look at those arms.
Hello, Michelin Man.

113
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,755
Phoebe, come on.
You know what, it's already 3:00.

114
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,952
They haven't even gotten
to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.

115
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,958
But Emma's got what it takes.
She could go all the way!

116
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,714
- Phoebe, you have to calm down.
- Okay.

117
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,193
Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state
area are in this room right now.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,715
I overheard a judge say that
not one of them holds a candle to Emma.

119
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,114
- Really?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,953
- You heard him say that?
- Yeah.

121
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,869
All right. Okay. All right, let's give
these babies something to cry about.

122
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,874
Good. Let's get down to business.
Emma needs some makeup.

123
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,229
What?

124
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,556
She's gonna look washed-out
next to the others.

125
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,035
No, I'm not letting you
put makeup on my baby.

126
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,356
- Why not?
- Because I already did.

127
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,912
You suck!
Get off the ice, you idiot!

128
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,150
- What a game.
- I know. Yeah.

129
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,392
- I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
- I'm sorry he's not here.

130
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,599
But I gotta say,
I am really enjoying nacho chair.

131
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,953
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
if you didn't keep batting my hand away.

132
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,999
- Yeah!
- These seats are great.

133
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,232
I know, I know.
When I was here for "Holidays on Ice"...

134
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,198
...I was sitting so far away,
Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.

135
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,757
We'd better get going. If we don't
leave now, we're gonna be late.

136
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,191
But it's a tie game. So we're a little late.
The girls will be there.

137
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,555
Let's just stay for one more goal.

138
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,199
- I don't know.
- One more fight.

139
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,197
- Okay.
- Okay.

140
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,796
Where is everybody?
They're 45 minutes late.

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,909
I can't believe they're not here.
I slave and I slave for what?

142
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,356
They've ruined Cranberry Day.

143
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,390
- How late are we?
- Forty-five minutes.

144
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,915
- Here.
- Okay.

145
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,756
Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
so they probably started without us.

146
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,037
We could just slip in, and
no one needs to know where we were.

147
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,993
- You may want to lose the foam finger.
- Oh, no, no, no.

148
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,754
You just want to put it on your hand.

149
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,471
- You're not at Thanksgiving?
- No, we're late.

150
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,790
- What are you doing here?
- We're late too.

151
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,520
We figured we could be late
because you'd be on time.

152
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,678
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.

153
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,116
- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.
- Yeah, where were you?

154
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,515
- Well...
- Yeah, what's with the trophy?

155
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,116
Well, we were at a spelling bee.

156
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,992
And I won.

157
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,514
You won an adult
Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?

158
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,078
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.

159
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,473
Let me see this. "Grand Supreme
Little Darling, New York Division"?

160
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,989
That's me.

161
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,436
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,434
And it looks like she put makeup on her.

163
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,588
Wait a second. Where have I seen
that cowgirl outfit before?

164
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,036
I can't believe this. She's our daughter.

165
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,755
That you would treat her like
some kind of show dog is inexcusable.

166
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,794
- She won a thousand dollars.
- So this is an annual thing?

167
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,078
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!

168
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,352
Guys, there are people in there
who are not getting any happier.

169
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,030
- What are we gonna do?
- I gotta put Emma down for a nap.

170
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,357
And, Rach, while you're in there,
throw something on Alicia May.

171
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,833
- All right, what are we gonna say?
- We'll say that we were mugged.

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,468
You can't get mad at someone
who's been mugged.

173
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,710
Good. But you don't look
like you were mugged.

174
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,155
No. Here.

175
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,959
Hey!

176
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,190
Do you hear something?

177
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,075
- They're out there.
- Let me see.

178
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,073
I can't believe this. They're an hour late,
and they're just standing there talking.

179
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,870
Everything's so distorted.
It looks like Joey has a giant hand.

180
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,232
That says "Rangers" on it.
They went to the game.

181
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,917
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.

182
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,713
- Ross' shirt is torn.
- They're late and they're sloppy.

183
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,114
All right, Emma's napping.
What happened to your shirt?

184
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,949
I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.

185
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,913
We're just trying
to figure out an excuse.

186
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,158
How about this?

187
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,518
We could say that Monica told us 5:00,
not 4:00. That way we're right on time.

188
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,789
Or we could plant PCP in the
apartment and call the cops on her.

189
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,797
That would be a good way to get rid
of all the PCP we have lying around.

190
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,871
We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.

191
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,635
We'll just act casual.
We're not late, we're right on time.

192
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,313
"We know you're out there."

193
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,235
Who do you think it's from?

194
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,954
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.

195
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,475
Well, let's just go in there
and face them.

196
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,629
I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on
Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.

197
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,469
I hate that thing.
It's like a bolt of lightning.

198
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,514
Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors,
and whoever loses, goes in first.

199
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,154
- All right, I'm in.
- Ready.

200
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,279
I win.

201
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,989
- What is that?
- That's fire. It beats everything.

202
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,112
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?

203
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,312
Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.
Well-played.

204
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,675
All right,
let's all go in at the same time.

205
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,115
- Okay.
- Okay.

206
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,310
- It's locked.
- What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.

207
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,391
When they're having sex on the couch,
it's like:

208
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,757
"Come on in,
my butt is surprisingly hairy!"

209
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,228
All right, come on. All right, you guys,
we're so sorry we're late.

210
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,834
Please let us in so we can have
dinner together.

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,391
No, everything's cold. The turkey's
dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.

212
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,393
Yeah, and there's a bowl
of cranberry sauce that's...

213
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,278
What happens to cranberry sauce?

214
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,477
- Nothing, it's fine.
- Oh, thank God.

215
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,036
Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
Our subway broke down.

216
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,749
That's a lie! You went to the game.
I can see Joey's hand.

217
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,916
For the love of God, take it off!

218
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,879
Guys, it doesn't matter
why we're late. We're all here now.

219
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,077
Please let us in so we can have
some of your delicious turkey.

220
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,918
I had a dream once
about a fax machine that did that.

221
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,396
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.

222
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,354
- How are we gonna decide who gets this?
- Water balloon!

223
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,280
What are we gonna do? I'm starving.

224
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,596
I just remembered,
we do have something to eat.

225
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,274
Monica put something
in our oven this morning.

226
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,635
You touch that,
and you will be sorry!

227
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,038
Guys, I'd listen to her.
The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!

228
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,750
Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!

229
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,235
That's worse than no food.

230
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,797
All you got was
Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts.

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,115
Stinky?

232
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,517
Please let me stay on this side
of the door.

233
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,076
Oh, I know!
I still have my old key.

234
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,356
We can just unlock the door.

235
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,398
I don't know if that's a good idea.
They don't wanna be with us.

236
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,198
I don't wanna be with them either...

237
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,796
...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should
not want to be together together.

238
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,679
If I could just get in there,
make a face-to-face apology...

239
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,400
...Iook them in the eye,
I could get them to forgive us.

240
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,199
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you...

241
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,558
...I can do it.

242
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,950
Yeah, he can do it.

243
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,790
It all looks so beautiful.

244
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,589
- The turkey, the stuffing.
- The cranberries.

245
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,837
Enough! A monkey could've made them.

246
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,951
Hey, listen, guys,
we feel really terrible.

247
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,153
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.

248
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,709
Don't look at him. Don't look at him.

249
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,311
Come on, you guys. We want
you to know we're very, very sorry.

250
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,471
Right, guys?

251
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,156
- I feel terrible.
- Oh, so sorry.

252
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,794
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.

253
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,077
Let's move past this and try to have
a nice meal all together, huh?

254
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,272
The floating heads
do make a good point.

255
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,957
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.

256
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,594
- So bad.
- So bad.

257
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,871
Okay.

258
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,477
Okay, you two go get the dessert,
and I'll let you in.

259
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,230
Dessert?

260
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,752
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up
the pies. You did remember, right?

261
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,873
Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."

262
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,235
Here.

263
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,912
- "Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
- Congratulations!

264
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,990
Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
Well, I cannot believe this.

265
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,589
You forced me to make dinner,
you're an hour late...

266
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,638
...and you forget the one little thing
that I asked you to do.

267
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,718
Really, girls, not cool.

268
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,310
Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
You lied about going to the game.

269
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,710
You knew it'd make you late,
and you went anyway.

270
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,678
Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
We said we're sorry.

271
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,276
It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
A day of forgiveness.

272
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,399
- It's a day to be thankful.
- Don't make me come up there!

273
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,999
It's too late for apologies.

274
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,958
Fine, let's just go.
I don't need your stupid dinner.

275
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,913
That would be a lot more convincing
if you weren't drooling.

276
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,472
- Oh, is that what that is?
- Sorry.

277
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,188
Come on, you guys,
let's just do our own Thanksgiving.

278
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,511
- Yeah, I'll cook.
- Yeah, let's go out.

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,798
Yeah, you three
have a nice Thanksgiving.

280
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,197
- The three of us?
- Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.

281
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,550
- I'm stuck.
- Joey, that is not gonna work.

282
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,756
No, seriously.

283
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,229
- I'm really wedged in here.
- I'll pull you through.

284
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,515
Okay.

285
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,594
Stop, stop, I'm worried
about damaging my head.

286
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,030
It's a little late for that.

287
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,472
Hurry up, you gotta do something.

288
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,995
All right, well,
this does not change anything.

289
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,151
We need to get something
to grease his face.

290
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,390
- We got turkey grease.
- Bring it.

291
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,479
I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred
to the vein as a separate person.

292
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,832
Here you go.

293
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,069
Oh, that smells good.

294
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,073
- Okay?
- Okay, try it.

295
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,711
It isn't working.

296
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,276
- We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
- Hurry, I can't feel my ears.

297
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,710
Can you ever feel your ears?

298
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,075
Interesting.

299
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,308
- Chandler, where are your tools?
- Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.

300
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,476
I don't have tools.

301
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,918
- Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
- I lent them to Ross.

302
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,356
- I gave them to Joey.
- I left them at the park.

303
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,675
I'm finding it really hard
not to mess with him.

304
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,791
I stuffed Brussels sprouts
down his pants.

305
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,075
Nice.

306
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,038
Okay, I have to get that.

307
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,351
Now, when I get back,
I want you and your friends to be gone.

308
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,672
Thanksgiving is over.
The vein has spoken.

309
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,792
- It's really starting to hurt.
- Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...

310
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,788
...and you guys push. Maybe we can get
enough room to wiggle him out, okay?

311
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,552
Okay, so push.

312
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,996
Just a sec. We're kind of
in the middle of something here.

313
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,998
Hey, stop putting things
down my pants.

314
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,913
- Come on, guys, push!
- Yeah, come on, push!

315
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,230
Push! Push!

316
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,679
- My cranberries!
- Man, I got food all over me.

317
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,153
I can't believe what you did.
Monica's gonna kill you.

318
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,799
Look! Look! Look what the...
Look what the floating heads did!

319
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,158
I don't care.

320
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,309
What's going on?

321
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,471
That was the adoption agency.

322
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,997
And?

323
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,119
- We're getting a baby!
- Are you serious?!

324
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,632
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
and she picked us.

325
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,957
- Oh, my God, that's great!
- That's incredible.

326
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,198
I'm so happy for you.

327
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,509
This Thanksgiving
kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!

328
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,477
To Monica and Chandler
and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.

329
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,198
I'm just so happy you guys
are finally getting a kid.

330
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,589
- I know.
- Have you considered pageanting?

331
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,870
I can't believe they called.
I mean, we're actually getting a baby.

332
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,832
I know how you feel.

333
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,273
- Really?
- Sure.

334
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,398
I went through the exact same thing
with Alicia May Emory.

335
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,276
The waiting, the wondering.

336
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,718
Then one day,
I get that call from Toys"R"Us.

337
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,678
She was in stock.

338
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,317
That is the exact same thing.

339

1
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:04,592
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:07,650
We're here to say goodbye.
We're off to Ohio.

3
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:10,003
Oh, right, your adoption interview.

4
00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:12,887
Yep. We'll meet the lady
who could be carrying our baby.

5
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:17,086
I can't believe it. When you come back,
you'll have a baby. That is so weird.

6
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:19,049
And so incorrect.

7
00:00:19,892 --> 00:00:21,532
She's only a few months pregnant.

8
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:23,923
She liked our application
but might not like us.

9
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:26,043
Come on, she's gonna love you guys.

10
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:28,602
Thank you. But we're trying
not to get our hopes up.

11
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:30,571
A lot could still get in our way.

12
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:33,612
She could decide against adoption,
like another couple better.

13
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:35,167
What are you gonna name it?

14
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:39,283
I could develop a condition in which
I talk and talk and no one hears a word.

15
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:43,408
But just think, okay?
What if everything goes right?

16
00:00:43,573 --> 00:00:45,689
What if this woman does pick you guys?

17
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:49,884
Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!

18
00:00:50,094 --> 00:00:52,560
So we're standing firm on
"not getting our hopes up"?

19
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:56,091
No. I know things could still
go wrong, but if they don't...

20
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:59,006
...if this works out,
we're gonna have a baby. A baby!

21
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:01,045
- Yes. But...
- Oh, my God. It's gonna work!

22
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:02,725
We're gonna make it work!

23
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:05,169
I'm gonna be a mommy,
and you're gonna be a daddy!

24
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,053
All right, I'll see you suckers.
I'm gonna go get me a baby!

25
00:01:12,574 --> 00:01:14,565
Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!

26
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:19,285
The One With the Birth Mother

27
00:01:56,934 --> 00:01:58,208
Hey, who's Phoebe with?

28
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,731
I wanna say, "Someone
I'm gonna have sex with."

29
00:02:05,612 --> 00:02:07,365
- Hey.
- Hey.

30
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:10,569
- So who's your friend?
- Oh, that's Sarah.

31
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:12,772
No. Don't you get any ideas.

32
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,289
I'm not setting you up
with any more of my friends.

33
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:17,926
- Why? Why?
- Because you'll date her once...

34
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,050
...sleep with her, then forget she exists.

35
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:22,248
Name one friend of yours I did that with.

36
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:24,682
- Mandy.
- Mandy, huh?

37
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:27,324
Really hot blond, big boobs?

38
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:32,163
- No.
- Might be why I don't remember, huh?

39
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,444
Do you think I'm someone else?

40
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:42,844
Look, I may not have treated
your friends well in the past.

41
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:45,847
But I have grown up a lot.
Really. Honest. Rach?

42
00:02:46,052 --> 00:02:47,885
Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.

43
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,885
I mean, when Joey
and I were together...

44
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:54,093
...he was wonderful.
He was thoughtful and mature.

45
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:57,131
And for the one week
that we went out...

46
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,611
...he didn't sleep with anybody else.

47
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,770
Growth.

48
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:06,652
- Fine, I'll give you her number.
- Okay. Thank you.

49
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,849
And I promise you
I will not forget this one.

50
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,331
- Mandy.
- Sarah!

51
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,252
Sarah.

52
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:15,807
- Hey.
- Hi.

53
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,169
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.

54
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,724
How does this look?

55
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:29,448
Well, it's... It's a little low.
Pick it up a little.

56
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:32,567
A little bit more.

57
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,051
A little bit more.

58
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:35,573
There you go.

59
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:39,004
Now throw it away.

60
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:41,764
Come on! This looks good.

61
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:45,242
Ross, please trust me.
I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.

62
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:48,770
Now I don't know who's running
for president or who that NATO guy is...

63
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:51,812
...but I do know that you
have to get far away from that hat.

64
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:53,527
Damn it. God...

65
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:56,445
I have this date tomorrow night,
and I have to look cool.

66
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,890
If you want fashion help, Rachel and I
are going shopping tomorrow.

67
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:03,045
- You're welcome to come with us.
- Really? That would be great.

68
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:04,647
I mean, I have to do something.

69
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:06,724
She kind of teased me
about how I dress.

70
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:08,445
I can see why. Nice shirt.

71
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:11,650
You're wearing the same shirt.

72
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,403
Stupid Gap on every corner!

73
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:27,052
Make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll be back with Erica.

74
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:28,930
Okay, thank you.

75
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:32,646
Well, this is it.

76
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:35,007
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just weird, you know?

77
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:39,689
It's like, "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have
the human growing inside you?"

78
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,846
You're gonna be great.

79
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:44,685
You're gonna be great.

80
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:47,286
Well, obviously.

81
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,963
Monica? Chandler?
I'd like you to meet Erica.

82
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:53,726
- Hi.
- Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.

83
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,848
- Hi.
- Thank you for agreeing to see us.

84
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:57,526
- Hi.
- I'll let you get acquainted.

85
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:00,730
- Okay.
- So it's Monica and Chandler?

86
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:05,007
I only know you as
"File CRW33815-D."

87
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:08,007
That's what our friends call us.

88
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:12,692
Gosh, you know, you're just
such an amazing couple. It's...

89
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,127
...kind of intimidating.

90
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:16,129
I don't know about that.

91
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:19,125
Are you kidding me?
I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.

92
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,608
But on top of it,
you're married to a reverend?

93
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:30,805
- I don't think that's exactly...
- Let her finish, doctor.

94
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:36,689
- Hey.
- Hey.

95
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,161
My friend Sarah
had a great time last night.

96
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:42,007
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?

97
00:05:42,213 --> 00:05:43,930
No.

98
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,723
What are you talking about?
Sarah's great.

99
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:50,442
Oh, really? You want to know
what your "great" friend did?

100
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,245
We're out to dinner, okay?

101
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:54,769
We were getting along,
having a really nice time.

102
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,725
I was thinking she was really cool.

103
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,367
And then, out of nowhere...

104
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,733
That's it?

105
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,168
That's why you won't
go out with her again?

106
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,925
So she took some fries. Big deal.

107
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,327
Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.

108
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:31,290
It's about what the fries represent.

109
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,769
- What?
- All food!

110
00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,045
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:39,329
I can't believe I set you up
with such a monster!

112
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,528
Hey, look, I take a girl out...

113
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,810
...she can order whatever she wants.
The more the better, all right?

114
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:48,851
Just don't order a garden salad
and then eat my food!

115
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:51,449
That's a good way to lose some fingers.

116
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,007
- Thank God you're here. Listen to this.
- What?

117
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:59,762
Joey and my friend are out last night,
having dinner, and she reaches over...

118
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:02,685
...and takes a few of his fries...
- Oh, no!

119
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,884
What?

120
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,120
You know about the plate thing?

121
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,721
Oh, yeah, yeah. No,
Joey doesn't share food.

122
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,531
I mean, just last week
we were having breakfast...

123
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,603
...and he had a couple grapes
on his plate.

124
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,007
- You wouldn't let her have a grape?
- No, not me.

125
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:19,447
Emma.

126
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,771
Joey doesn't share food!

127
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:32,245
Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
not to call someone again.

128
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,603
You are calling her, okay?

129
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:38,202
And if you need to, then just
get an extra plate of fries for the table.

130
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,365
I like that.

131
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,807
A sharing buffer. Yeah.

132
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:50,283
Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
Maybe a plate of onion rings.

133
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,086
Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,524
And a shrimp cocktail.

135
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,846
And some Buffalo wings.

136
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:59,925
Maybe...
Maybe an individual pizza, huh?

137
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,483
And some mozzarella sticks.

138
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,370
What were we talking about?

139
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,968
Wow, this place is awesome.

140
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:14,608
We should just go.
I'm not gonna find anything here.

141
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,125
This stuff is ridiculous.

142
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:18,894
Oh, this place is great!

143
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:23,769
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear
any of this. Nothing silver.

144
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:26,884
- Why?
- Okay, nothing with hair.

145
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,687
And nothing with padlocks on it!

146
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:32,687
Ross, look. Look, I know that some
of this stuff is out there.

147
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,447
But I mean, come on, look at this.
Look at this sweater.

148
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,284
I mean, this is just beautiful.

149
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,568
Wow, this is really soft.

150
00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,172
Three hundred and fifty dollars?

151
00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:46,490
Down from 700.
You're saving, like, 200 bucks.

152
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:52,167
Both logic and math are taking
a serious hit today.

153
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,770
Hey, check this out. It's totally you.

154
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,206
- Wow.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,528
Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.

156
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:05,013
Yeah.

157
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,049
"Boys will be boys"?

158
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:13,288
- What? They will be!
- All right.

159
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,446
- That's it, I'm getting out of here.
- No, Ross, wait, come on.

160
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:20,533
There's other stuff here. There's some
nice shirts, these nice pants.

161
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,769
Actually, these might look
pretty good on me.

162
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:25,653
Yes, they will. You know what you
should do? Go take a walk.

163
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:29,361
All right? I know your size, and I'll
pick out some really good stuff for you.

164
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:30,893
- Really?
- Yes.

165
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:32,485
I know what looks sexy on guys.

166
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:35,650
Just wear what I suggest,
and she is gonna go nuts for you.

167
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,173
So you're saying...

168
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:41,326
...if I wear these pants,
I might be getting into hers?

169
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,568
Why do men keep talking to me like this?

170
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:50,571
So the fact that I'm a doctor
and my wife's a reverend...

171
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:52,131
...that's important to you?

172
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:54,169
Yeah. I read some great applications...

173
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:57,245
...but I thought, "Who better
than a minister to raise a child?"

174
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:58,932
Amen.

175
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:04,043
Plus, I thought the baby would be
in good hands with a doctor.

176
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,731
Good hands.

177
00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:07,884
Healing hands.

178
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:12,211
Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible
say anything about adoption?

179
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:14,289
It says, "Do it."

180
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:20,562
"And behold, she did adopt
unto them a baby.

181
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:24,567
And it was good."

182
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:29,004
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

183
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:32,121
I was wondering...
You both have such serious jobs.

184
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:35,250
Would you have time to take care
of a baby and your flock?

185
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,568
Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.

186
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:40,884
Yeah. My flock pretty much
takes care of themselves by this point.

187
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,168
Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.

188
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,807
But being a doctor,
that must take up a lot of time.

189
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,653
Not for me it doesn't.

190
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,803
So how's everything going in here?

191
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:55,486
We're great. I think
I may have asked all my questions.

192
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,451
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?

193
00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:01,207
Yeah, actually.
So you read a file that you liked...

194
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:04,808
...and then you gave the agency
the serial number and they contacted us?

195
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:07,207
Yes. Our system ensures
total anonymity.

196
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:10,284
- We're very proud of it.
- You should be.

197
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:13,692
You're really on top of stuff.

198
00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:17,369
Well then, if there's nothing else,
then the two of us should talk.

199
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,013
I actually...

200
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:21,369
- I don't think we have to.
- We don't?

201
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:24,649
Yeah, when I read about you two,
I was pretty sure I wanted you...

202
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:27,326
...but I just thought we should meet
face to face.

203
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,602
I've made my decision.

204
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,566
I choose them.

205
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,965
God, this is great.

206
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,929
This is so great. Did you hear that?

207
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:37,605
Yeah, I did.

208
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,245
Hey.

209
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:42,808
Thank you. Thank you so much.

210
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,164
You are so going to heaven!

211
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:55,370
- We got some really great stuff.
- Yeah.

212
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,923
Yeah, but I'm not sure about some
of the bras I got.

213
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,562
Really? Do you want to try
some of them on for me?

214
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:02,048
Okay.

215
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:04,807
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?

216
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,163
Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags
by mistake.

217
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,129
And one of mine is missing.

218
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,601
Ross probably has it.
You'll get it from him later.

219
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:23,284
So, what do you think?

220
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:28,524
I think we're not wearing
the same shirt anymore.

221
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:31,644
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.

222
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:34,533
She told me to trust her,
and you know what? I'm glad I did.

223
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,206
I turned quite a few heads
on my way over here.

224
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,172
Dude, I really don't think
you should be wearing that.

225
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:44,167
I see.

226
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:48,405
Somebody's afraid of a little competition
with the ladies?

227
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:51,845
Looks like someone is the ladies!

228
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:55,285
You're just jealous
because you couldn't pull this off.

229
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:59,121
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.

230
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:05,250
See? All eyes on me!

231
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:12,644
- We are not signing those papers.
- Why not?

232
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:16,364
It's wrong. They made a mistake.
They think we're somebody else.

233
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,961
God works in mysterious ways.

234
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,769
You have got to stop.

235
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:23,773
But she liked us.

236
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:26,645
She likes Doctor Chandler
and Reverend Monica.

237
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:30,443
If you think about it,
I'm kind of like a reverend.

238
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:37,006
I mean, as a chef, I serve God
by feeding the hungry and poor.

239
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,530
Your veal chop is 34.95!

240
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,451
Come on, I just...
I think we've been given an opportunity.

241
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:47,447
The mistake's already made.
They're writing up the papers now.

242
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:49,451
But we're not the ones she chose.

243
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:51,605
How can you feel okay about this?

244
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,971
Because.

245
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,283
We may not be who she thinks we are...

246
00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:01,091
...but no one will ever
love that baby more than us.

247
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:02,773
- I know.
- I mean, who knows...

248
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:05,812
...how long it's gonna take
for someone else to give us a baby?

249
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,442
What if no one ever picks us?

250
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,206
Oh, honey...

251
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:11,885
Please?

252
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,442
Please. We are so close.

253
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,528
Monica, I want a baby too.

254
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,889
But this woman is giving away her child.

255
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:23,807
She deserves to know who it's going to.

256
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:32,808
Okay. You're right.

257
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:36,961
So we'll tell the truth.

258
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:40,490
And who knows, you know?
Maybe she'll like us for us.

259
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,809
Maybe she will.

260
00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:47,443
Why couldn't I have been a reverend?

261
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,769
You're Jewish.

262
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,250
Technicality!

263
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,004
Garden salad for the lady.

264
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:03,323
Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.

265
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:07,201
Seafood platter for the gentleman,
and extra fries.

266
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,010
Enjoy.

267
00:15:11,293 --> 00:15:12,807
Those fries look delicious.

268
00:15:13,014 --> 00:15:15,163
I didn't know you liked French fries.

269
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,052
Help yourself. What's mine is yours.

270
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,211
Wow, are those stuffed clams?

271
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,004
Yes, they are my stuffed clams.

272
00:15:33,374 --> 00:15:36,172
How about those fries, though, huh?

273
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,850
- They are delicious.
- Yeah.

274
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:45,928
You are beautiful, you know that?

275
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,889
That is so sweet.

276
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,727
Okay, then.

277
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:05,730
Now look what you did!

278
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:08,009
What? What is the matter with you?

279
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:11,409
I don't like it when people
take food off of my plate, okay?

280
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,490
But you said, "What's mine is yours."

281
00:16:13,692 --> 00:16:15,284
Well, I didn't mean it!

282
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:20,770
Fine. Sorry, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

283
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,169
No, I'm sorry. I...

284
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:28,610
I'm overreacting, okay?
It's just, when it comes to food, I...

285
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:30,251
...have certain rules...

286
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,125
...okay? I mean...

287
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:37,087
...there are things you do, and,
you know, things that you don't do.

288
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:45,331
Wow, this place looks great.

289
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:49,804
Oh, you are gonna love it.
And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

290
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:52,884
- Me too.
- Here.

291
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,288
So this was fun.

292
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:13,846
I really am sorry about,
you know, before.

293
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:16,527
And I want to make sure you
know I really do like you.

294
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:19,372
Sure, just not as much as clams.

295
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,246
Well, stuffed clams...

296
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:25,005
Chocolate torte for the lady.

297
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:27,209
Cheesecake for the gentleman.

298
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,965
Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some
sort of red crap on my cheesecake.

299
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:35,330
Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.

300
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:38,571
I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,
trying to be healthy.

301
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,488
Oh, my God.

302
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,128
- I'll just have what she's having.
- I'm sorry, sir.

303
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,045
That was our last piece.

304
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:53,323
Oh, no.

305
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:56,053
This is work. I should call in.
Can you excuse me?

306
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:58,370
Yeah, sure. No problem.

307
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,604
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food?

308
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,326
Sure I do.

309
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:07,324
Coulis?

310
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:11,208
No. If I can't have your clams,
you can't have my dessert.

311
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:12,931
This is a two-way street.

312
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,126
Really?

313
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,128
Really.

314
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:21,888
Now this all better be here
when I come back.

315
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:25,649
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.

316
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,688
Stop staring at me!

317
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:53,323
Just a tiny little...

318
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:08,888
I'm not even sorry.

319
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,564
- Hi.
- Hey.

320
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:18,647
So these are the preliminary forms
for an open adoption.

321
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:21,573
There's a lot to go over,
but I'll explain as we go through.

322
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,684
- Is that a picture?
- Yeah.

323
00:19:25,893 --> 00:19:28,248
It's a sonogram they took
of the baby last week.

324
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:30,005
I thought you might want to see it.

325
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:39,165
Look, doctor.

326
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:46,126
Look, before we sign anything,
we really have to talk.

327
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:51,331
We're not who you think we are.

328
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:54,446
- I don't understand.
- The agency must have made a mistake.

329
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:57,451
My wife is not a reverend,
and I'm not a doctor.

330
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,485
- What?
- That's impossible.

331
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:02,844
I could perform an operation on you
and prove it if you'd like.

332
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:07,532
I have to check your file. Excuse me.

333
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,007
So who are you?

334
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:12,171
Our names really are Monica and
Chandler. We're from New York.

335
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,642
Yeah, but the important thing
to know about us...

336
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,805
...is how much we would care
for this little baby.

337
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:19,890
So you lied to me before?

338
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,563
Well, we "bore false witness."

339
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:27,323
See? I could be a reverend.

340
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,726
I can't believe this.

341
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:32,368
But we were hoping that
since we told you the truth...

342
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:35,525
...that you still might consider...
- Giving you my baby?

343
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,729
You think I'd give you my child
after this?

344
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:40,448
You don't have to decide now.
If you look at our file...

345
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,572
I don't want to look at your file.
This is over.

346
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,486
Erica, wait.

347
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:51,531
I have nothing to say to you.

348
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:53,764
Look, you have every reason to be upset.

349
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,286
We did lie.

350
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:59,372
But only because we've been waiting
and trying to have a baby for so long.

351
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:02,843
And we don't know how long it's gonna
be before we get another chance.

352
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,090
Why don't you ask the reverend
to pray on it?

353
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:08,006
Erica, please.

354
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:12,207
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.

355
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:14,251
Our last name's Bing.

356
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,848
My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising.

357
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:19,686
Oh, yeah.

358
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,287
I actually liked you guys.

359
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:25,810
But it doesn't matter.
What you did was wrong.

360
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:28,402
But you did like us.

361
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:30,485
And you should.

362
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:33,123
My wife's an incredible woman.

363
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:37,172
She is loving, and devoted and caring.

364
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:41,328
And don't tell her I said this,
but the woman's always right.

365
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:48,249
I love my wife more than anything
in this world.

366
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:51,006
And it...

367
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:55,291
It kills me that I can't give her a baby.

368
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:02,849
I really want a kid.

369
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:07,442
And when that day finally comes,
I'll learn how to be a good dad.

370
00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:09,686
But my wife...

371
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:12,209
...she's already there.

372
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:14,445
She's a mother...

373
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:17,449
...without a baby.

374
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,005
Please?

375
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:39,444
You still want that baby?

376
00:22:54,454 --> 00:22:56,524
God bless you, Chandler Bing!

377
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:12,207
Turns out this sweater
is made for a woman.

378
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,405
So why are you still wearing it?

379
00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:18,092
Because it's soft.

380
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,533
Hey, so how was your date?

381
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,451
Not so good.

382
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:29,531
Well, looks like it's just
the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?

383
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:32,605
Yeah. And you know what?
We could do a lot worse.

384
00:23:32,774 --> 00:23:34,810
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

385
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:39,691
Joey doesn't share food!

386
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:42,525

1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,310
This cake is amazing!

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,074
My God, get a room.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,192
I would get a room with this cake.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,476
I think I could show
this cake a good time.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,837
If you had to, what would
you give up, food or sex?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,991
Sex.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,992
Seriously, answer faster.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,113
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,352
But when she said "sex,"
I wasn't thinking about sex with you.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,115
It's like a giant hug.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,589
Ross, how about you?
Which would you give up?

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,432
Food.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,999
How about sex or dinosaurs?

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,276
Oh, my God, it's like <i>Sophie's Choice</i>.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,914
Oh, God.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,719
What about you, Joe?
What would you give up, sex or food?

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,318
I don't know, it's too hard.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,790
No, you gotta pick one.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,718
Food. No, sex.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,395
Food. Sex. Food. Sex...
I don't know! Oh, God, I want both!

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,313
I want...
I want girls on bread!

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,271
The One Where Chandler Gets Caught

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,635
- You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
- Oh, how cute!

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,076
- She looks just like a little doll.
- Oh, no, that is a doll.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,959
Oh, thank God,
because that thing's really creepy.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,757
Look, there's Chandler.

27
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,230
Who's the blond? She's pretty.

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,714
He's having an affair.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,276
He is not having an affair!

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,317
I'm always right about these things.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,995
No, you're not. Last week,
you thought Ross was trying to kill you.

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,869
Well, sorry, but it's hard to believe
that anyone would tell a story that dull...

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,917
...just to tell it.

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,237
There's something going on with them.

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,391
Look!
He's getting into the car with her.

36
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,039
That doesn't mean anything.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,031
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,997
Okay, duck down.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,588
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Chandler. It's Phoebe.</i>

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,512
<i>I know that Monica is working today...</i>

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,229
...so I was wondering if you wanted to
come to the movies with me and Rachel.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,316
Oh, I have to work too. Yeah,
I'm stuck here at the office all day.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,755
Well, it's a shame
that you'll miss the movie...

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,152
...because we were gonna see,
you know, either <i>Liar Liar</i>...

45
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,309
...or <i>Betrayal</i>
or <i>An Affair to Remember</i>.

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,871
Those are all really old.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,988
Okay, then maybe it'll be...

48
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,832
<i>Dude, Where's My Car?</i>

49
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,313
- What?
- They're in a car.

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,432
Okay. Well, talk to you later, okay? Bye.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,074
Jeez!

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,913
Okay, quick. We gotta find a cab
and follow them.

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,153
Yeah, okay. Let me just grab my
night-vision goggles and my stun gun.

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,471
I got them.

55
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,869
- Hey.
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.

56
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,548
Hey, you smell like
perfume and cigarettes.

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,234
- I was in the car with Nancy.
- Nancy doesn't smoke.

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,437
Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
Be thankful for that.

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,558
So... What did you think of the house?

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,597
It's everything we've been looking for.

61
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,354
Isn't it? And what about
the amazing wanes coating...

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,159
...the crown molding
and the dormer windows in the attic?

63
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,550
And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps!

64
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,878
What were the things you said?

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,873
- Don't you love the huge yard?
- The fireplace in the bedroom.

66
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,951
And Nancy said it's really underpriced...

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,908
...because the guy lost his job
and has to move in with his parents!

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,799
This is bringing out a lovely color in you.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,109
So do you think we should get it?

70
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,759
I don't know. What do you think?

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,319
- I think we should.
- I do too.

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,948
This is huge. How bad do you wanna
smoke right now?

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,038
I don't know what you mean,
giant, talking cigarette.

74
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,470
Phoebe called as I was getting
into Nancy's car.

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,517
If she asks you, I was at work all day.

76
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,432
Got you. When do we tell them?

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,115
We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.
Why upset everybody over nothing?

78
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,554
Okay. Right.

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,555
- Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
- I know. Good luck with it.

80
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,155
I just can't see Chandler cheating.

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,710
I'm telling you guys, we followed
them out to a house in Westchester.

82
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,351
They went in for 45 minutes, and then
they came out looking pretty happy.

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,553
Chandler?

84
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,199
Forty-five minutes?

85
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,878
Well, something's not right.

86
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,157
I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.

87
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,436
I know, and with the baby coming?

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,750
- So should we tell her?
- I don't know.

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,674
If one of us saw Mike with another
woman, would you want us to tell you?

90
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,035
Why? Who'd you see him with?

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,476
- No one. I'm just saying if we did...
- Tell me what you know!

92
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,753
No one! Nothing! Mike's a great guy!
It was hypothetical!

93
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,034
All right. He is a good guy.

94
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,191
You're right. He wouldn't cheat.

95
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,830
If I did see him with someone,
there's no way l...

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,991
Who did you see him with?

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,113
Oh, look at her. So happy.

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,711
If only there were a smaller one
to clean this one.

99
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,237
Hey, is Chandler here?

100
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,550
No, he's picking up dinner.
Why? What's up?

101
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,075
Look, whatever happens,
we're here for you, and we love you.

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,389
- All right.
- Chandler might be having an affair.

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,194
- What?
- Phoebe and I saw Chandler...

104
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,477
...with a blond woman today
outside on the street.

105
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,996
And then we followed them
to a house in Westchester.

106
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,516
They went in together. I'm so sorry.

107
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,269
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful.

108
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,675
What did you think of the house?

109
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,113
What?

110
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,629
Monica, you understand
what we're saying, right?

111
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,430
Yeah. Sure. I mean,
I'm devastated, obviously.

112
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,113
Did you think the neighborhood
was homey?

113
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,712
- Hey.
- You son of a bitch.

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,232
Is it me, or have the greetings
gone downhill around here?

115
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,749
Phoebe and Rachel
saw you with Nancy today.

116
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,592
They think you're having an affair.

117
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,478
- Who's Nancy?
- What's going on?

118
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,632
Okay...

119
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,233
All right, you better sit down.

120
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,994
- This is... This is pretty big.
- Yeah.

121
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,679
I'm not having an affair.

122
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,833
Nancy is our realtor.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,549
I knew he couldn't be
with a woman for 45 minutes!

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,597
Why do you have a realtor?

125
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,839
She's been showing
us houses outside of the city.

126
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,633
- What?
- Are you serious?

127
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,314
When we found out
that we were gonna get this baby...

128
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,631
...Chandler and I decided
we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.

129
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,631
So you're... So you're gonna move?

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,672
Oh, my God.

131
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,919
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?

132
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,430
What is wrong with raising a kid
in the city?

133
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,955
I'm doing it. Ross is doing it.

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,475
Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!

135
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,790
And that's great for you guys,
but we want a lawn and a swing set.

136
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,076
A street where our kids
can ride their bikes...

137
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,231
...and maybe an ice-cream truck
can go by.

138
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,960
So you want to buy a house in the '50s.

139
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,556
Have you thought about
what you're giving up?

140
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,790
You can't move out of the city.
What if...?

141
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,951
What if you want Chinese food
at 5 a.m.?

142
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,839
Or a fake Rolex that breaks
as soon as it rains?

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,231
Or an Asian hooker
sent right to your door?

144
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,676
You know what? If you want to look
for a house, that's okay.

145
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,752
No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him.
I'm gonna thump you.

146
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,716
It's okay, because they have
to get it out of their system.

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,676
Okay? But you're gonna realize
this is the only place you want to be.

148
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,432
Actually...

149
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,318
...we already found a house we love.

150
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,712
- What?
- About an hour ago, we made an offer.

151
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,394
Bet you wish I was
having an affair now, huh?

152
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,949
- You put an offer on a house?
- It's so sweet.

153
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,351
It really is. It has this big yard
that leads down to this stream.

154
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,397
And then there's these old maple trees.

155
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
Oh, again with the nature.
What are you, beavers?

156
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,314
Look, I know this is really hard,
and we're really sorry.

157
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,597
Is this because I come over here
without knocking and eat your food?

158
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,876
Because I can stop doing that.

159
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,315
I really, really think I can.

160
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,789
You know that's not the reason, Joe.

161
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,715
I think if you saw it, you'd understand.

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,075
You guys were there.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

163
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,150
- Yeah, it is.
- What the hell are you doing?

164
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,995
Well, it is, all right? When we were
out there today, all I kept thinking was:

165
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,435
"I can't believe Chandler's
screwing this woman...

166
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,830
...but, man, this would be
a nice place to live!"

167
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,071
Yeah, but so is this.

168
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,152
Yeah. I mean, if you move there,
you have to leave here.

169
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,675
I mean, how can you leave this place?

170
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,995
Come on, Daddy, listen!

171
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,755
All my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!"

172
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,354
"You're a shoe! You're a shoe.
You're a shoe!"

173
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,398
I stopped and said,
"What if I don't want to be a shoe?

174
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,516
What if I want to be a purse?

175
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,752
Or a hat?"

176
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,788
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
l...

177
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,076
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

178
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,711
You can see where he'd have trouble.

179
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,231
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

180
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,509
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

181
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,231
Your money's mine, Greene.

182
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,038
Your fly's open, Geller.

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,239
You know what I just realized?

184
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,517
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J"!

185
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,191
Coincidence?

186
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,557
That's "joincidence" with a "C"!

187
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,350
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

188
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,471
That had to hurt!

189
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,951
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.

190
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,395
Instead of watching football,
you could help.

191
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,391
We know.

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,512
Rachel, you want to put
the marshmallows in concentric circles.

193
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,513
No, Mon. You want to put them
in concentric circles.

194
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,069
I want to do this.

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,556
Every year.

196
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,396
It's stuck!

197
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,788
Step.

198
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,279
How did it get on?

199
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,034
I put it on to scare Chandler.

200
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,749
Oh, my God! Monica's going to
totally freak out!

201
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,512
Plus, it smells really bad in here.

202
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,549
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head up a turkey's ass.

203
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,748
Monica.

204
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,588
Did you get the turkey...?

205
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,354
Oh, my God!

206
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,313
Who is that?

207
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,959
It's Joey.

208
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,028
I got it!

209
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,192
If we win, they have to
get rid of the rooster.

210
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,237
That's interesting!

211
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,359
If you win...

212
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,158
...we give up the bird.

213
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,871
But if we win...

214
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,190
...we get your apartment.

215
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,712
- Deal!
- What?

216
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,273
"Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"

217
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,351
- Big Fat Goalie.
- Correct!

218
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,750
"Rachel claims
it's her favorite movie."

219
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,273
<i>Dangerous Liaisons</i>.

220
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,954
- "Her actual favorite movie is...?"
<i>- Weekend at Bernie's</i>.

221
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,793
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"

222
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,234
- Everyday use.
- Fancy.

223
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,833
- Guest.
- Fancy guest.

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,831
- Two seconds.
- Eleven?

225
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,030
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct.

226
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,758
"Chandler was how old when he
first touched a girl's breast?"

227
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,194
- 14?
- No, 19.

228
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,873
Thanks, man.

229
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,110
"Joey had an imaginary
childhood friend.

230
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,077
- His name was...?"
- Maurice!

231
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,356
- "His profession was...?"
- Space cowboy!

232
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,556
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"

233
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,918
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.

234
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,674
Something to do
with transponding.

235
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,718
He's a transponster!

236
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,871
That's not even a word!

237
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,839
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,197
Don't get mad! No one
forced you to raise the stakes.

239
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,794
That is not true!
She forced me!

240
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,428
You got the question wrong.

241
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,830
It was a stupid, unfair question!

242
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,592
Don't blame the questions!

243
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,959
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.

244
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,714
Chandler!

245
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,395
I saw what you were doing
in the window!

246
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,677
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

247
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,879
Listen, we had a good run.

248
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,235
What was it?
Four, five months?

249
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,631
That's more than most people
have in a lifetime. Goodbye.

250
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,597
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

251
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,548
What the hell are you doing?

252
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,709
What's going on?

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,833
I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

254
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,955
Dude, he's right there.

255
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,992
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

256
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,197
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!

257
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,989
We're not just messing around.
I love her.

258
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,912
I'm in love with her.

259
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,754
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

260
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,558
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.

261
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,519
My best friend and my sister!

262
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,515
I cannot believe this!

263
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,638
This is the last box of your clothes.

264
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,633
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"

265
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,475
I was gonna go across
the hall and write that on Chandler.

266
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,594
Guys, I don't wanna make
things worse, but...

267
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,115
...I don't want to live with
Rachel anymore.

268
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,671
You're so mean to each other.

269
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,991
I don't wanna end up like that
with Rachel. I still like you.

270
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,870
That's fine because I'm not moving.

271
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,917
Phoebe, you gotta take her.

272
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,598
I said some bad stuff...

273
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,797
...but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.

274
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,909
She gets tons of catalogs and folds
down the pages of things I'd like.

275
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,229
What else?

276
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,756
When I take a shower...

277
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,070
...she leaves me notes on the mirror.

278
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,356
I do. I do do that.

279
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,394
That's nice. I like having things
to read in the bathroom.

280
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,954
When I fall asleep on the couch...

281
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,031
...she covers me with a blanket.

282
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,954
Well, you know,
I don't want you to be cold.

283
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,152
And when I told her that I was gonna
move in with Chandler...

284
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,756
...she was really supportive.

285
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,037
You were so great.

286
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,912
You made it so easy.

287
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,594
And now you have to leave.

288
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,320
And I have to live with a boy!

289
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,952
- She really left.
- I know.

290
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,351
- Thank you.
- No problem, roomie.

291
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,594
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

292
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,354
What the hell is that dog doing here?

293
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,271
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

294
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,832
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned...

295
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,549
...but for me this has
been really great.

296
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,030
I think because it didn't
involve divorce...

297
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,428
...or projectile vomiting.

298
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,718
If you had gone to Vail...

299
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,998
...or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have...

300
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,752
...syphilis and stuff...

301
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,797
...we wouldn't be
all together.

302
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,951
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

303
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,717
...that I'm very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

304
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,671
- That's so sweet!
- Thank you.

305
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,830
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,228
And a crappy New Year!

307
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,755
- Hear, hear!
- Hear, hear!

308
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,590
You can't move. You just...
You just can't.

309
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,274
Rachel's right.
This is where you guys belong.

310
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,830
You don't wanna live in Westchester.
That's the worst of the Chesters.

311
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,436
You know, sometimes when I'm alone
in my apartment, I look over here...

312
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,797
...and you guys are just having dinner...

313
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,758
...or watching TV or something...

314
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,072
...but it makes me feel better.

315
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,595
And now when I look over,
who am I gonna see?

316
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,115
The Gottliebs? The Yangs?

317
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,796
They don't make me feel so good.

318
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,158
Yeah. So don't move, okay?
Just stay here...

319
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,436
...and maybe close your blinds at night.
- Hey.

320
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,198
Hello?

321
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,910
It's Nancy. They responded to our offer.

322
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,354
And?

323
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,677
Okay. Thanks.

324
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,114
They passed.

325
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,474
They said they won't go a penny
under the asking price.

326
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,359
- We can't afford that.
- I know.

327
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,839
Well, there you go.

328
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,118
I'm really sorry, you guys.

329
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,716
Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry
that phone call didn't come...

330
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,314
...before I told you about looking
through the window.

331
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,676
Yeah. Well, we're gonna
let you be alone.

332
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,671
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, we'll be okay.

333
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,114
Love you guys.

334
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,319
You know, I'm really sorry
I wasn't more supportive before.

335
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,959
That's okay. We understand.

336
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,872
Yeah, and about this Nancy...

337
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,031
If you're not sleeping with her, should I?

338
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,028
I know there'll be other houses,
but I just...

339
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,078
- I love that one so much.
- Yeah.

340
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,955
Well, it's a good thing we got it then.

341
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,476
- What?
- We got the house.

342
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,078
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't wanna tell you in front of them.

343
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,798
We got it?! We got the house?!

344
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,518
We're getting a house!

345
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,273
- We're getting a house.
- And a baby.

346
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,759
We're growing up.

347
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,553
We sure are.

348
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,873
- Who's gonna tell them?
- Not it!

349
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,837
Not it! Damn it!

350
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,992
Rachel, this is yours.

351
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,673
Why? What are these for?

352
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,593
- You'll see.
- All right, everybody open them.

353
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,593
Wow, this is so beautiful!

354
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,990
These are the ones
I was looking at in the store!

355
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,037
- I know.
- Oh, I love this!

356
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,918
A meatball sub!

357
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,994
Thanks!

358
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,674
Seriously, guys, what's going on?
What are these for?

359
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,718
Well, I didn't know
how to tell you before...

360
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,916
...but we got the house.
- Enjoy!

361
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,948
What did they say?

362
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,838

1
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:06,441
Alright, let's play one more time, okay?
And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.

2
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:09,027
Okay.
Can't beIieve I'm risking this again, but you're on!

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:13,289
Alright Joe, you remember the rules.
Heads I win, tales you lose.

4
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:14,799
Just flip!

5
00:00:16,524 --> 00:00:16,958
Dark tails!
Damn it!

6
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:23,077
Hey, so we thought we'd throw you a little going away party around 7.

7
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:24,587
Oh, that sounds good!

8
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:27,171
Hey Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing?

9
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:28,361
It's all done!

10
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:29,460
Oh yeah, right.

11
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:34,117
And after I took a shower this morning
I just threw my towel on the floor!

12
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:36,453
Oh, God!
It hurts to even joke about it.

13
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:37,242
I know... honey, seriously I did it all.

14
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:43,512
The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom. This is Emma's Paris stuff,

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,688
... these are boxes that I'm having shipped,
... and that's the sandwich I made for the plane...

16
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,957
Okay, so you've done some good work.
What about your carry-ons?

17
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:57,284
Oh well, everything that I need is in here,
and my travel documents are on the counter

18
00:00:57,284 --> 00:01:01,889
... organized in the order that I will be needing them.

18
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,998
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!

19
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,792
Where's your passport?

20
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:08,243
It should be right next to my plane ticket.

21
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:10,253
- Well, it's not.
- What?

22
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:11,825
Maybe I put it in here...

23
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:17,900
Oh, oh, it's not in there!
Oh no...
I must have packed it in one of these boxes!

24
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:18,801
Here, let me help you.

25
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:23,779
Shoot...
Oh, I can't believe I did this!

26
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:27,594
At what point did it stop being funny
that I took her passport?

27
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:40,480

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,583
Oh, wow, can you believe you're really 3 weeks away?

32
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:20,691
I know.

33
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:22,885
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?

34
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:27,795
No, I don't mind you touching my belly,
... but right now your hand's kinda blocking
the part where baby's gonna come out.

35
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,693
- Hey!
- Hi.
- Hey Erica, welcome back to town!

36
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:36,850
Wow, look how big you've gotten.

37
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,288
That's because I 'm pregnant!

38
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,178
Right, no, I... I understand.

39
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:46,129
Oh, okay! I'm just always afraid that
people think I'm just fat with big breasts.

40
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,638
No, no, I knew.

41
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:54,518
Okay, well, stop staring at them!

42
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:55,943
She brought them up!

43
00:02:55,944 --> 00:03:00,071
I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!

44
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:02,534
Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.

45
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,798
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors
and get settled into the hotel.

46
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,660
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?

47
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:09,699
Because we're moving in a couple of days
and it just didn't make sense.

48
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,068
Plus hotels are fun!

49
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,005
My room has this little fridge full of free snacks.

50
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:17,321
Erica, those things aren't free.

51
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:20,715
In fact they have one of the highest markups
in any consumer product...

52
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:24,606
Ross! She's giving us her baby.
She can eat you if she wants.

53
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:27,297
I'll be right back.

54
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,766
- Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
- Oh, I know, I know.

55
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:39,243
Hey, you know you can take it if you want!
The lease is still in Nana's name!

56
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,435
No no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.

57
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:45,076
Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?

58
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:46,445
Yeah, it takes 2 incomes.

59
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,964
Hey, is Chandler here?
We talked about catching a movie.

60
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,654
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that.

61
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:53,750
But if you want you can go help
him and Joey pack up the guest room.

62
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:57,692
Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.

63
00:03:57,694 --> 00:04:01,841
Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.

64
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:14,792
What are you guys doing?

65
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,973
Try it,
I can't feel a thing!

66
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:28,847
Are, are you kidding?
This is packing?

67
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:29,303
- We are taking a break!

68
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,769
- From...?

69
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,673
Jumping on the bed?

70
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:37,568
Alright, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours
and there's a lot to do!

71
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,107
Now, Ross, you got Geller blood,
you are in charge of these yahoos!

72
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,827
- You got it!
- Alright.

73
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:44,311
Alright, she's right. We gotta get serious.

74
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:47,517
Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants
and kick him!

75
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,529
No, no, no, guys. She's right.
We should get to work.

76
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:56,776
I'll take stuff out of the closet,
... Joey, you pack 'em,
and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.

77
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,182
You guys hear a ringing?

78
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:05,516
- What the hell is this?
- Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice!

79
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:11,606
I didn't know you guys had it in ya!

80
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:17,592
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't
understand how much this bums me out.

81
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,878
I didn't know Monica had these!

82
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,803
Mhm, maybe she used 'em with another boyfriend.
Maybe Richard!

83
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:30,236
Why would she use them with Richard and not me?

84
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:36,175
I can be kinky!
I once did a naked danced for her... with scarves!

85
00:05:38,635 --> 00:05:40,993
Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.

86
00:05:48,123 --> 00:05:48,862
- Hey!
- Hey!

87
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:49,746
Where is Mike?

88
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:50,706
Oh, he has a gig.

89
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:52,898
I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know.

90
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,178
My husband has a gig.

91
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,259
Yeah? Where... where is it?

92
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:02,983
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.

93
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:05,528
Rock on!

94
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:09,325
Wow, this is quite a spread!
What is all this stuff?

95
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,682
Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity
to use up all the food ...

96
00:06:11,683 --> 00:06:15,113
...that I don't want to move
to the new house with me!

97
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:17,289
So, enjoy:

98
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:24,561
... smoked oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust,

99
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,961
... kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.

100
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:31,103
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, where's Rach?

101
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,145
Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.

102
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,897
Now it just  hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional

103
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,761
... so no one say anything to set her off, okay?/Yeah.

104
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,958
- Hey, Rach, hey you.
- Here she is!

105
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:45,697
HIi you guys!

106
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:48,152
What did I just say?

107
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,412
No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna be fine.

108
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:54,505
Come here, I'll make you a drink.

109
00:06:56,697 --> 00:07:01,405
Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving.
How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?

110
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:06,092
I know, she's been such a big part of my life,
and it feels like when "Melrose Place" got cancelled.
I mean...Oh, forget about it. I miss "Melrose Place"!

111
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:22,966
- You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
- Yeah? Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row?

112
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:31,496
You know, heads she wins, tails I lose!
Wait a minute...

113
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,591
Yes, Joe?

114
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,704
I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.

115
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:41,511
You doing okay?

116
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:46,048
- Well, I've been better.
- Uh-hmm.
You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?

117
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,159
Yes! You know,
in 6 months the Statue of Limitations runs out
... and I can travel internationally again!

118
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,839
- I'm gonna miss you so much!
- I know.

119
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,150
You know what?
Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff
that I wanted to say to each of you

120
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:05,075
... and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here.
Come here.

121
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:09,690
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?

122
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:15,445
Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap and
Phoebe's doing the punching.

123
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:22,034
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.

124
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:27,941
Okay well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed
to get your "going away" presents,
but I do have something for you.

125
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:31,764
Oh, oh. What is it?

126
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, it's cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it,

127
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:43,113
... so that if they perfect the cloning process while you're over there,
you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!

128
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:54,012
I... I'm gonna throw this away,
... but thank you so much for the gesture!

129
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,153
Chandler?

130
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:02,136
I was just in our bedroom
and I found these on my pillow.

131
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:08,588
Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you
... in case Richard stops by and you wanna
engage a little light bondage and mustache play!

132
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,497
What are you talking about?
These aren't mine.

133
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:16,432
Oh yeah, right!
Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!

134
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,871
That would be a terrible punishment.

135
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,632
- But I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
- Really?

136
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:27,114
Then what are they doing in our guest room?

137
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:28,986
Rachel used to live in that room.

138
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:34,337
Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!

139
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:39,339
Joey's bare ass!

140
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,472
Well Played.

141
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,576
- I love you Phoebe.
- I love you too.

142
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:58,738
Please, please don't... don't turn into... you know, French bitch!

143
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,183
- Alright. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
- Okay.

144
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:11,110
- Okay. Monica?
- Yeah?
- Can you come here with me for a minute?
- Sure.

145
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,818
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
- No.

146
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,388
No, you're so screwed.

147
00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:25,757
Hey, what's that all about?

148
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,526
She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.

149
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,438
Are you kidding? Oh my God...

150
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,042
Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God...

151
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,069
Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.

152
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,997
Oh, man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this.

153
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,993
Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year.

154
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:51,499
And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.

155
00:10:56,898 --> 00:11:04,132
Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say...

156
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:12,295
None of the amazing things that happened to me in the last ten years,would've happened if it wasn't for you.

157
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:17,957
No one's been more like a sister to me.

158
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:22,830
I know what you mean.
You are like a sister to me too.

159
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:31,170
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...

160
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:40,008
- You're the best friend I ever had.
- (Says something that cannot be understood)

161
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:41,930
What?

162
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:49,130
I... I... I... (again says something that cannot be understood)

163
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,285
That is so sweet!

164
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:03,665
Oh no, she took down Monica...
And I'm the cryer in the family.

165
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:07,139
Oh God! I could be next.

166
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:10,361
- Maybe she won't talk to me if it
looks like we're deep in conversation.
- Okay.

167
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:15,810
Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really
made me think about that other thing.

168
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:16,782
- Uh, Rach?
- Yah?

169
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:18,800
Well it's okay. Chandler's talking to her.

170
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,746
I really made you think about that thing uh?

171
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,945
Uh, Rach...
I think I have something that belongs to you.

172
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:38,203
Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.

173
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:43,279
No, no, no... They are really yours.
We... found them in your old room.

174
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,264
Well, these aren't mine.

175
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,993
Maybe Monica used to use them with...

176
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:46,963
Don't say Richard!

177
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,385
Well, if they are not Monica's and not yours,
... then whose are they?

178
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,328
Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former
resident of that room.

179
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:57,849
Pheebs!
Yeah!

180
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:02,257
I think these are yours.

181
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:07,465
These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on!

182
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:14,634
Good God! You try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these,they'll snap like a piece of licorice.

183
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,329
- Can I taIk to you alone for a minute?
- Sure.

184
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:25,524
You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes, do you?

185
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,111
Where do you think Mike really is?

186
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:38,824
- Oh honey...

187
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:45,225
- Let me just say something... Because once we get into this,
I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some
stupid joke...

188
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:57,759
I just want to say that I...I love you.
And, I'm gonna miss you.
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.

189
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:07,231
Oh, you know what?
Let's not say anything else.
I love you.

190
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,737
Ooh, not so tight...

191
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,452
- I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
- Okay. Oh...

192
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,540
I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.

193
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,290
So, I guess you are next.
You are ready?

194
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:32,716
- I don't think so.
- Oh, you're definitely not.

195
00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:35,798
I haven't cried like that in years.

196
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,068
You cried yesterday at the 6 o'clock news.

197
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,677
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.

198
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:48,172
God! I can't believe she saved me for last.
Why are they taking so long?

199
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:53,217
- I dunno. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.

200
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:56,743
- No, no, no, no!

201
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:07,048
Okay, here we go...

202
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:12,487
Oh... Well...
Yeah...

203
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:19,835
I think I'm gonna to take off.

204
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:27,668
- Huh?
- Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much.I love you. Good night.

205
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:38,631
What?
I don't get a goodbye?!

206
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,134
Lucky bustard!

207
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:51,128
Unbelievable!
She says goodbye to everyone but me!

208
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,971
Well,
maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be,
you know, implicit.

209
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,271
Well, it needs to be plicit.

210
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:04,732
Alright, let's think about this.
I mean, there's got to be an explanation.
Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?

211
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,126
No, I don't think so.

212
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:11,274
You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.
It's pretty intense.

213
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,283
- Yeah. Mine too.

214
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:13,119
- Mine was a humdinger.

215
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:14,172
Okay!

216
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,981
I mean don't I deserve anything?
I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?

217
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:24,582
NOT FROM YOU!

218
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:29,340
Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.

219
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:33,672
And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.

220
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,217
THE HELL I DO!

221
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:40,524
I don't get a goodbye?

222
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:41,182
What?

223
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,493
Everyone gets a goodbye but me?

224
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:45,718
What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh?

225
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:50,094
Be best firiends with you?
Uh, go out with you?

226
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,355
H..have a baby with you?
Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things!

227
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:54,195
Ross...

228
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,254
Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit.

229
00:16:56,256 --> 00:17:00,591
Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to 5 people.

230
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:05,357
Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises)
It's physically impossible!

231
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:15,995
You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe
this is how you want to leave things between us.

232
00:17:21,365 --> 00:17:23,026
Have a, have a good time in Paris.
I hope Ross isn't too upset.

233
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:25,333
- I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.

234
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,152
- Tell me about it.

235
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:28,914
Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.

236
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:32,263
Alright, I think I'm gonna head out.

237
00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,603
Uh, where do you think you're going?

238
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:39,715
I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing
there's something less fun for me to do here?

239
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:45,691
We are moving in a couple of days
and we've got a lot of packing to do.
It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.

240
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,357
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.

241
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,785
Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.

242
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:53,544
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.

243
00:17:53,545 --> 00:17:55,808
You couldn't be cool.

244
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,506
Okay, We're gonna start in the kitchen.

245
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:02,412
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked ten to a box.

246
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:06,102
The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped.

247
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:06,943
- Got it?
- Yeah.

248
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:09,284
Good. Now I need you to be careful and efficient.

249
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:13,321
And remember, if I'm harsh with you, it is only
because you're doing it wrong.

250
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,964
Hey Mon, I think I've figured out whose handcuffs they are.

251
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:19,764
You did? How?

252
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:25,427
Well, I was cleaning out the closet and
I found some pictures of them... being used.

253
00:18:25,428 --> 00:18:27,275
Oh my God! Let me see.

254
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:31,302
Who's that dirty old lady?

255
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:33,864
Monica's grandmother.

256
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,361
Nana liked it rough!

257
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:42,381
Hi.

258
00:18:42,383 --> 00:18:43,342
- Hey!
- Come on here, have a seat.

259
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:44,302
How was your night?

260
00:18:44,303 --> 00:18:49,620
Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and
then out for dinner.

261
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:58,868
We went to this place that had...
Ooh...Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these
really amazing cheeseburgers.

262
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,623
Erica, are you okay?

263
00:19:03,624 --> 00:19:09,608
Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
I keep getting these stomach aches.
They come and go like every few minutes.

264
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,538
- Oh my God!

265
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,969
- Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.

266
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,524
She doesn't have a stomache ache.
She's in labor!

267
00:19:18,526 --> 00:19:19,561
- Oh my God!

268
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:21,257
- Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.

269
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:25,422
Okay! Chandler, get the coats.
Erica let's go.
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!

270
00:19:28,806 --> 00:19:35,125
Oh my God we're gonna have a baby.
Alright. We're gonna have a baby!
Oh God, oh God,
I got to sit down, I got to sit down.

271
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,113
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.

272
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:40,169
- You can do this. Just breathe.

273
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:45,133
Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.

274
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:48,216
- Ooh! Are you sure?

275
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:52,044
- Oh... Yes, I'm sure.
- Oh honey, let's go.

276
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:55,109
- Okay bye everyone.

277
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:56,781
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait...

278
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:57,741
- What?

279
00:19:57,742 --> 00:20:00,325
If you get a second, find out
where she got that cheeseburger.

280
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,993
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you
because I don't care?

281
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:12,371
That's what it seemed like.

282
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:17,574
I cannot believe that after 10 years,
you do not know ONE thing about me.

283
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,138
Fine, then why didn't you say something?

284
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,490
Because it is too damn hard, Ross!

285
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:27,591
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I'm gonna miss you.

286
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:31,981
When I think about not seeing you everyday,
it makes me not want to go...

287
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:37,675
Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you
because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else,


287
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:41,795
... you're wrong.
It's because you mean more to me.

288
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:44,861
So there, alright, there's your goodbye... Oh!

289
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:46,290
- Rach!
- What?

290
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,799
- You keep, you keep... You can't...

291
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,865
- What?

292
00:21:09,456 --> 00:21:10,491
- A little more.
- Okay.

293
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:13,843
A little more, a little more.

294
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,342
Alright. Okay, let's do this.

295
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,995
- Alright, ready?

296
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,348
- Yeah. Alright, now give me your best shot.

297
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:27,586
Alright, here it goes...

298
00:21:33,454 --> 00:21:34,708
Doesn't work...
